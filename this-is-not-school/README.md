## Notes

The original is in [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nIcs3p82gR2Z9yMVIXchYGef2DYpg09KNb1CURjPYCo/edit?usp=sharing). If you want modifications to this presentation, you may either request them of Ryan Henning, or you may make your own copy.

Pay special attention to the slide transitions. They are strategic. The PDF version is for reviewing only. Do not present the PDF version since the transition are missing.

The *notes* section for each slide contains the verbal *script*. Many slides are intentionally sparse, so it is important you know the verbal script in order to deliver them properly.
