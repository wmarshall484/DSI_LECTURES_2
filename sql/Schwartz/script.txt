I started out by talking about why learn sql:
1 - you will probably use it at some point (and the queries you need will be easy)
2 - you will probably get interview questions on it (and the queries you need will be hard)


The warmup for the day should be getting postgres installed:
https://github.com/zipfian/welcome/blob/master/notes/postgres_setup.md
(this can be accessed through learn)

1) follow the instructions above (now accessable in learn) to get things installed
2) run the "postgres" app to get the little elephant 
3) type "psql" at the command prompt to launch
4) type "\l" in the postgres server to list data bases
5) type "\c readychef" to connect to, e.g., the readychef database
6) type "\d" to show the tables
7) type "\d table" to show the schema of "table"

The slides can be used for the first hour.
The "2nd_hour.txt" file has some examples to run for the second hour.
And then we just send them on their way.

The individual and paired sprints are here:

(this is now accessed through learn)

is great practice and could be done in place of sprints

Here are potential warmups (now in gSchool dsi-warmups) for the next day:



# this is the same database that we use in the SQL sprints 
ready chef: https://github.com/zipfian/miniquizzes/blob/master/sql_readychef.md

simple (no data): https://github.com/zipfian/miniquizzes/blob/master/sql_sales.md
more practice (make your own data): https://github.com/zipfian/miniquizzes/blob/master/sql_logs.md

schema/queries (waiting on Brad): https://github.com/zipfian/miniquizzes/blob/master/sql_hitch.md

For later...
