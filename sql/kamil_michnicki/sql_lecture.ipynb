    "### What is a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: A relational database is composed of tables with relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does a relational database differ from other databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: You could have a text file or a nested dictionary. These are not tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a database management system and why do we use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: A DBMS is a program, an interface between you and the tables in the database. \n",
    "Imagine that we used a certain block of memory to store our data. What problems\n",
    "would we have?\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>1. Concurrency: If one person is updating every row of a table one by one and another is reading\n",
    "every row, the person reading may get a half-updated view of the database. This is called concurrency.</li>\n",
    "<li>2. Fault-tolerance: If the computer loses power and shuts off halfway through an update or insert, then the \n",
    "data may be incorrectly or formatted incorrectly.</li>\n",
    "<li>3. Data independence: Suppose you were writing an application that used this data. What if you change how you manage the data? \n",
    "For instance instead of making updates directly to your data you could first make a copy of it, update the copy and then make the copy your live table by changing a pointer. Suppose you wanted to implement this in your application. In your application you might have pointed directly to where in memory the data was stored. Changing where the table is stored by first updating a copy would then break your program. By storing your data in a database and accessing it with a database management system, you can separate data management from your application. </li>\n",
    "<li>4. Speed. We'll be using a relational database management system called PostGreSQL. We will be accessing it via the SQL language. By installing a new version of postgres, we can speed up all of our queries to the database, say if Postgres releases a new and better version, without changing our queries.</li>\n",
    "<li>5. Finally, even if you are the only one accessing your database, you might have data spread out on several machines. You could use Spark to access this data and you can access it with SQL queries. You don't have to think about how to fetch the data from the cluster, Spark will figure it out for you. \n",
    "</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason DBMS are used: We would like concurrent access to a database in a fault-tolerant way which keeps how data is managed and stored\n",
    "separate from how it is used in an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. and 2. are achieved with transactions and Xacts. A transaction takes the database from one consistent\n",
    "state to another. A transaction is made up of Xacts and Xacts are re-ordered by the DBMS in order to \n",
    "execute concurrent queries quickly.\n",
    "3. is achieved by using SQL to access data in the database. This way there can be an update to the DBMS\n",
    "which makes queries faster without changing how an application communicates with the DBMS.\n",
