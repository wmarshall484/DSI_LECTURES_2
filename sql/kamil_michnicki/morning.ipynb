    "### Where is data used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do people record data?\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Yelp - They keep track of restaurants,  users and reviews </li>\n",
    "<li>Facebook - They keep track of users and friends. </li>\n",
    "<li>Hospitals - They keep track of medical records. </li>\n",
    "<li>Amazon - They keep track of users, products, purchases and reviews</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "What sort of things do we not have data about?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use a database management system?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use databases? You could store data in a file and have everyone share it. What are some problems with this? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concurrency and transactions:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Two people reading the same data is fine.</li>\n",
    "<li>What if one person starts reading while another person reads. What version will they get? Will it be a consistent datafile?</li>\n",
    "<li>What if one person is halfway done inserting a row while the other starts to read the row?</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fault tolerance\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "What if the computer crashes or the connection is lost? Transactions protect the database.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data independence\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "What happens when the format of the data is changed within the text file? Do you now need to change all your code? How data is handled is abstracted from how data is managed.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a DBMS?  \n",
    "<b>DBMS are systems that solve all of the problems that we had with storing data in a shared text file.</b> They allow us concurrently access and change data in a fault tolerant way which abstracts the way data is managed from how it is used in an application. This is all done for us under the hood, behind the scenes by the DBMS and quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a relational database?\n",
    "<b>What is a relational database?</b> <b><i>Essentially tables with rows and named columns.</i></b> These columns are called fields. A set of fields which are associated with the same row of data is called a relation. Think of yelp. The restaurant id name and type of food are a relation. They are related to each other. Different tables are also related to each other. Restaurants are related to reviews which are related to users.\n",

    "\n",
    "All concurrently, fault-tolerantly, in the background and quickly. \n",

    "We will use <b>postgresql</b>. It's an open source rDBMS. You can compare it with other systems here:\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_relational_database_management_systems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we use Postgresql?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installing Postgres\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest installing posgresql with homebrew and start/stopping with lunchy but you can find a general installation guide for postgres on linux, mac and windows at:\n",
    "https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommendations for install on mac:\n",
    "Install homebrew, a package manager for mac. \n",
    "http://brew.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "Install lunchy and postgres with homebrew. Lunchy lets us start and stop a database server with less typing.\n",
    "https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-postgresql-on-a-mac-with-homebrew-and-lunchy/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connect to postgres database via command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the server. If you installed lunchy, you can do it with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $lunchy start postgres\n",
    "\n",
    "Or to stop it(make sure to restart it for this exercise if you do stop it.):\n",
    "\n",
    "    $lunchy stop postgres\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a database:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $createdb database_name\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to connect to the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $psql database_name\n",
    "\n",
    "If the database is on a different server you can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $psql -h < host > -p < port > -U < username > -W < password > < database_name >\n",
    "    \n",
    "You will typically connect to a database with a username and if it is not on your own machine, you will need the hostname and perhaps the port as well. Users have different priveledges, like read-only or restrictions on tables that you can write to. \n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL - Structured Query-markup Language. It's a declarative language. You declare what you want to happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a declarative statement: get me all of the scores for all of the games played by the Seattle Sounders in 2015. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can contrast this with a procedural programming language like Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a procedural statement: Go through each row of the games table. If the row happened in 2015 and the Seattle Sounders played in the game, record the scores of that game. Bring me that record. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "    SERIAL - every field needs a datatype. This type automatically increments this column when a new row is inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    PRIMARY KEY - Think of a dictionary. Each workd is a key. Keys are ways of looking entries in a table. A primary key makes sure every row is uniquely identified. If you try to insert a row with the same id as a previous id, because it is a primary key, you will get an error. \n",
