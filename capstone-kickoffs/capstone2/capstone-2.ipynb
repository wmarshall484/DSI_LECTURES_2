    "# Capstone 2 Kickoff\n",
    "\n",
    "The next week we'll commit to a capstone proposal, and build a minimum viable version of the final capstone project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capstone 1: Dry Run\n",
    "Week 4\n",
    "\n",
    "A low-stakes way to practice your tools so far and get a feel for the capstone proposal process. If you get started on an idea you love, you can build on capstone 1 in the following capstones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capstone 2: Commit to final proposal\n",
    "Week 8\n",
    "\n",
    "A guided process for locking in the topic for Capstone 2 & 3. A specific deliverable will be expected at the end of Capstone 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capstone 3: Make something amazing\n",
    "Week 11, 12\n",
    "\n",
    "A wealth of time to work very independently on making something amazing that builds on Capstone 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capstone 2 project proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working on the same project during Capstone 2 and 3. The proposal for this project will be more detailed and more specific than Capstone 1. Specifically, whereas the last project was focused on exploration, this capstone needs to **solve a specific problem**. The problem could be from the world of:\n",
    "* Business\n",
    "* Nonprofit organizations\n",
    "* Government\n",
    "* Academic research\n",
    "* Open source tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we say that the project should \"address a business case\"; here \"business case\" means \"specific real-world problem\" not necessarily limited to the functioning of a for-profit business.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating project proposals\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a strategy for generating a project proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Think of a frustrating thing; some kind of struggle or pain-point.\n",
    "2. Think of a tool that would address or alleviate that struggle.\n",
    "3. See if you can express that tool in terms of one of the aspects of \"data science\"\n",
    "   * Supervised learning\n",
    "      * Classification\n",
    "      * Regression\n",
    "   * Unsupervised learning\n",
    "      * Clustering\n",
    "      * Topic modeling\n",
    "   * Recommender system\n",
    "   * Hypothesis testing\n",
    "   * Network analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* Taxi driver\n",
    "  * Problem: Taxi driver doesn't get any riders.\n",
    "  * Tool: App says where to go where there will people will be hailing cabs.\n",
    "  * Data science: **Supervised regression**: Given a location and time, predicts how long until a rider hails a cab.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Online store\n",
    "  * Problem: Don't know how to organize inventory onto website\n",
    "  * Tool: Upload images and descriptions of products, automatically organizes it\n",
    "  * Data science: **Heirarchical Clustering** vectorize images and decscriptions and perform heirarchical clustering to give a \"directory\" structure of inventory\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Political campaigns\n",
    "  * Problem: if you're competing in many districts, where should you focus your campaign?\n",
    "  * Tool: A system that analyzes polling data to give a confidence interval of the vote outcome\n",
    "  * Data science: **Hypothesis testing** find a probability distribution of a bernoulli distribution represnting the vote, given a number of samples from that distribution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Reading\n",
    "  * Problem: I wish I could read a very specific book that doesn't exist\n",
    "  * Tool: Select some books, and then find books that \"combine\" them.\n",
    "  * Data science: **Topic Modeling** find latent topics of input books, combine their latent topic vectors, and find books that are similar to the combined vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a list of *more than ten* problems, and then use this process to see if you can generate a data science project. Not every idea will yield a project. That's fine. A few will.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverable: Minimum Viable Product\n",
    "\n",
    "We only have about four class-days to work on this project. As a result, the scope will be very limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of next week, you should have a \"minimum viable product\" (\"MVP\") implementation of your idea. The MVP will consist of working code that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loads your data\n",
    "* Vectorizes it into features\n",
    "  * If supervised, also finds the target\n",
    "* Fits a model\n",
    "* If supervised:\n",
    "  * Predict on the test set\n",
    "  * Calculate a test metric\n",
    "* If unsupervised\n",
    "  * Transform the dataset\n",
    "  * Show the transformation in a straightforward way\n",
    "    * In \"online store\" example, show the inventory directory structure.\n",
    "    * In the \"book combiner\" example, show the search results for combining two books.\n",
    "    \n",
    "That's all. You don't have to make a website or a fancy presentation, or chase down every improvement you think while you're working. That's what Capstone 3 is for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rough Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "The rough process for this is:\n",
    "* **Friday**:\n",
    "    * Nail down proposal by mid-day\n",
    "    * Have dataset downloaded and EDA'd before end of day\n",
    "* **Monday**:\n",
    "    * Finish up EDA by mid-day\n",
    "    * Start with featurization\n",
    "* **Tuesday**:\n",
    "    * Finish featurization\n",
    "    * Pick a model and train it.\n",
    "* **Wednesday**:\n",
    "    * Get model training finished by mid-day\n",
    "    * Show your result MVP results at end of day.\n",
