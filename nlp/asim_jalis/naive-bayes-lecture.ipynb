    "1. Great performance. It is just counting probabilities.<br>\n",

    "3. Each class has its own parameterization. So we can add new classes.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Text fits the requirements.<br>\n",
    "2. Using bag-of-words, the number of features is very large (~10,000 - 50,000)<br>\n",
    "3. Usually this is larger than the number of samples.<br>\n",
    "4. So n << p.<br>\n",

    "<br><details><summary>\n",

    "us?\n",
    "</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The words in text classification are frequently not independent.<br>\n",

    "1. Naive Bayes was studied in the 60s.<br>\n",
    "2. It was used in the early 90s for spam filtering.<br>\n",
    "3. In 2002 Paul Graham wrote an essay about using Naive Bayes for spam filtering which popularized it.<br>\n",
    "4. Also Graham tweaked it to reduce the false positive rate.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "<br><details><summary>\n",
    "How did Paul Graham reduce the false positive rate?\n",
    "</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tokenized email headers as well.<br>\n",
    "2. Did not use stemming.<br>\n",
    "3. Decreased false positive rate by double counting words in nonspam dataset.<br>\n",
    "4. Various other techniques. See [essay][pg-spam] for details.<br>\n",

    "the tokens?\n",
    "</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Graham in fact preserved the case.<br>\n",

    "What are false positives and negatives in the case of spam? Are they the\n",

    "\n",
    "1. False positives are non-spam emails that get classified as spam.<br>\n",
    "2. For example, your boss's email goes into the spam folder.<br>\n",
    "3. False negatives are spam emails that show up in your inbox.<br>\n",
    "4. False positives are much worse than false negatives.<br>\n",
