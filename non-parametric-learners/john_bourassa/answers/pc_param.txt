Pros:
-----
1. Simpler:
    * Easier to understand and interpret results
2. Less data:
    * Don't require as much training data (since you assume a form)
Cons:
-----
1. Strong Assumptions:
    * By assuming a form, data must match that form for a good fit
2. Limited Complexity:
    * Number of parameters to describe data is fixed
    * Could fail to match the signal of the data
