Common Things to Pre-Prune
--------------------------
* Leaf size: stop splitting when num of samples is small enough
* Tree depth: stop splitting at a certain depth
* Purity: stop splitting if purity of leaf nodes hits certain threshold
* Gain Threshold: stop splitting when info gain fails to meet threshold
