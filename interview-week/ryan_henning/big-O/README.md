## Big-O Lecture

I start with these [hand-written notes](big-o.pdf) on the whiteboard.

Then we work through [efficiency.ipynb](efficiency.ipynb).

We calculate the big-O efficiency class of EVERY function in the notebook. (I have the students do it, and I just facilitate.)

Note: Big-O questions are very common (at least in Austin). Also, sorting questions are very common (at lest in Austin).
