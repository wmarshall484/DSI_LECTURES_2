5. """
Given a list of strings, return a list of lists of strings where each inner list contains no duplicates.
For example:
["a", "b", "c", "a", "a", "b"] -> [ ["a", "b", "c"], ["a", "b"], ["a"] ]
Your solution should minimize the number of inner lists.
For example:
[ ["a"], ["a"], ["b"] ] would not be a correct solution for ["a", "a", 'b"].
The correct solution would be [ ["a", "b"], ["a"] ]
