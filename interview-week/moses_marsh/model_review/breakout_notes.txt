Pair up and give a brief definition of each of the following terms:
	Supervised vs. unsupervised
	Regression vs. classification


Here are some data with clear decision boundaries. How do different models handle these?


When should I update my model?


When do I need to scale my features?


What are some models with long training time? Short training time? Long prediction time? Short prediction time?


How do I use cross-validation to pick a model? What scores can I use across models?


When might it be useful to use a less interpretable model if it gives better predictions?
