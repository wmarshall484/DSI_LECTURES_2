We will do 5 sessions according to the sections below.

* Sections 1 and 2 will be covered in two blocks of 1.5 hours on Monday.
* Sections 3 and 4 will be covered in two blocks of 1.5 hours on Tuesday.
* Section 5 and any leftover subjects will be covered on Thursday before graduation.

Every subject should be covered by one student for about 5 minutes with discussion afterwards.

Subjects will be chosen by students on a first come first serve basis, but students are strongly urged to choose stubjects they feel weaker in.
