# Matt's Model Validation and Regularization Lesson

This lesson covers model validation in the morning and regularized regression in the afternoon.

## Morning: Model Validation

The content is in slides (rare for me!).  The original content is from Ryan Henning, with modifications by Jeff Omhover and me.

[Cross Validation Slides](cross-validation-slides.pdf)

### Objectives

  - Define overfitting and explain why it is a *bad thing*.
  - Define model bias and model variance and give examples of models suffering from each.
  - Describe the bias variance tradeoff, and how it affects the out of sample error of models.
  - Measure the out of sample error of a model with a test set.
  - Measure the out of sample error of a model with cross validation.

## Afternoon: Regularized Regression

The content is in a notebook, and covers both ridge and LASSO regression methods.

### Objectives

  - Use ridge regression to find the optimal complexity for a linear regression model.
  - Use LASSO regression to find the optimal complexity for a linear regression model.
  - Discuss the influence of the regularization hyperparameter on the bias and variance of the model.
  - Explain the difference in objectives between ridge and LASSO regression.
