# Client Server Architecture

---
class: middle, center

A *server* is program that sits around and waits for requests, and responds with an answer.

A *client* is a program that makes requests to the server and waits for the answer.

Question: what's an example of a web client?

Question: what else using a client-server architecture?

# HTTP

---
class: middle, center

HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol) is the communication *protocol* used to send messages between computers on the world wide web.

---
class: middle, center

The *client* sends a request.

The *server* sends a response.

---
class: middle, center

### Request Verbs:

.left[
- **GET**: Requests some data.  Generally only retrieves data with no other effect.
- **POST** Sends some data.  Requests that the server accept and process the data, possibly sending a response.
- Others...
]

---
class: middle, center

### Response Codes:

.left[
- **200**: Ok.  The request was processed successfully.
- **401**: Unauthorized.
- **404**: Not found.

# HTML

---
class: middle, center

### Hypertext Markup Language

HTML is a language for creating an annotated text document, which web browsers interpret and display.

*Tags* are used to give semantic meaning to the different parts of the document.

---
class: middle, center

### HTML Syntax

.left[
HTML consists of ordinary text marked up with tags (words in angle brackets). To make an unordered list

<ul>
  <li>1st item</li>
  <li>2nd item</li>
  <li>3rd item</li>
</ul>

you do
```
<ul>
  <li>1st item</li>
  <li>2nd item</li>
  <li>3rd item</li>
</ul>
```
]

### HTML Tags

.left[
- `<head>`: Contains other tags giving overview information on the document, title, author, etc.
- `<p>`: A paragraph of text.
- `<span>`: A short segment of inline text with a distinct semantic meaning.
- `<div>`: A section of the document with a distinct semantic meaning.
- `<input>`: <input value="A place for the user to type input.">
- `<button>`: <button>A button for the user to click.</button>
- `<a>`: An anchor, generally a link to another site.
]

---
class: middle, center

Tags can have attributes attached.

The `class` attribute is used to attach visual style to the element.

```html
<button class="btn-primary btn-real-big">A Really Big Button</button>
```

The `id` attribute should uniquely identify the element, and is used to attach *behaviour* to the element:

```html
<input id="username" value="What is your username?">
```

# Javascript

---
class: middle, center

*Javascript* is a programming language that runs in web browsers.

It is used to associate dynamic behaviour with HTML elements.

---
class: middle, center

*jQuery* is a very useful javascript library that makes manipulating HTML elements much easier.

.left[
```javascript
// Grab the value of the input element with id username
$("input#username").val()
```

```javascript
// Associate an event to clicking on the button with id message
$("button#message").click(function() {console.log("You clicked it!");}
```
]

# Flask

---
class: middle, center

*Flask* is a python library for handling web requests on the server.

---
class: middle, center

Flask works by attaching python functions to urls.  These "functions attached to url"'s are called *views*.

.left[
```python
@app.route('/respond-to-message')
def respond_to_message():
    users_message = request.json['message']
    return jsonify({"message": "I am responding to: {}".format(users_message)})
```
