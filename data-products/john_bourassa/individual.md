# Individual Exercise

Create your own web app!  Make sure your site does the following:

* Accepts user input, passes input to the server, does some kind of computation and returns a result
* Utilizes a data model to retrieve or persist information
* Populates an HTML template

Bonus points for using a CSS template!

In the afternoon session, we will be hosting these websites on AWS, so please have something put together
