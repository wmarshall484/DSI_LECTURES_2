John's Web Scraping Lecture
===========================

A lecture on Mongo Database and Web Scraping, covers the following topics:

### MongoDB

  - Clients vs. Servers.
  - JSON.
  - Using MongoDB to store data.
  - Querying and updating a Mongo Collection.
  - Translating between Javascript CLI and pymongo

### Web Scraping

  - HTTP requests
  - HTML Structure.
  - Getting hypertext into python with `requests`
  - Loading hypertext as a python object with `BeautifulSoup`.
  - Navigating hypertext with `BeautifulSoup.`
  - Storing data scraped from hypertext.

The content here is a (quite heavily) modified version of Matt Drury's lecture (which was a (quite heavily) modified version of Miles Erickson's lecture).  The major changes are:

  - Flipped morning and afternoon topics.
  - Heavier focus on HTTP and web understanding.
  - Discussion of what I call "hidden" APIs.

Morning and Afternoon
---------------------

My thinking is that learning web scraping first motivates the reason that we're covering MongoDB at all, so I moved it to the morning session.
