A lecture on Mongo Database and Web Scraping, covers the following topics:

Borrowed heavily from Matt Drury

### MongoDB

  - Client's vs. Servers.
  - JSON.
  - Using MongoDB to store data.
  - Querying and updating a Mongo Collection.

### Web Scraping

  - HTML Structure.
  - Getting hypertext into python with `requests`
  - Loading hypertext as a python object with `BeautifulSoup`.
  - Navigating hypertext with `BeautifulSoup.`
  - Storing data scraped from hypertext.

The content here is a (quite heavily) modified version of Miles Erickson's lecture.  The major changes are:

  - A general re-arrangement of the material.
  - A general filling in of details around bullet points in the original.
  - A new example scraping the leaderboards for Super Metriod from a website.

Morning and Afternoon
---------------------

The split between morning and afternoon is quite natural here.  In the morning I cover Mongo topics, and in the afternoon I cover scraping.

Key Points for Student Interaction
----------------------------------

There are some excersizes built in throughout the lecture building on key concepts.  Some other ideas:

  - Give students the chance to name other examples of a client server architecture.
  - Navigate to a webpage with a table, and have students use the developer tools to isolate the hypertext that contains the table.
