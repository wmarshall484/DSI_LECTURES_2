This is all setup on the Zipfian workstations, but if you'd like to use your home computer, you can install all the same packages.

#### Step 1: Install Anaconda

We will be using [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) with Python version 2.7. Install this and you will have Python along several useful packages and programs:

* NumPy
* SciPy
* Pandas
* statsmodels
* MatPlotLib
* IPython
* nose
* pep8

You can see the [full list of packages](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs.html) if you are so inclined.

You can use [conda](http://www.continuum.io/blog/conda) or pip to install any packages that are not included like this:

```
pip install flask
```

#### Step 2: Install Atom

We will use Atom for editing (If you have mastered `vi` or `emacs`, there is no need to switch). When you are working alone, you are welcome to use any editor you'd like. You can download [Atom](https://atom.io) for free, or install via `brew`:

```
brew cask install atom

```
