Matt's First Day Lecture
========================

Instructor Introductions
------------------------

The most importnat points here is `welcome_and_administrative.ipynb` which is edited from a prior instructors welcome notebook.

I had each instructor in the classroom to introduce themselves during the instuctor information section.  It's important for the students to know the instructors as soon as possible:

  - What are the instructors relative strengths (i.e. Matt is good at stats and supervised learning, Jeff is good at design and ideation, etc.)
  - The students get a feel for the instructors personalities and openess.

We want to drive student's comfort with asking questions as soon as possible, and introducing ourselves personally is a good way to do that.


Pair Programming Demo
---------------------

In addition to discussing git in the administrative section, two instructors should role play a pair programming excersize.  I included a small class in the repository to facilitiate this, but really anything you are comfortable will work.

The sequence of tasks are to

  - Both fork a repository.
  - Both create `individual` and `pair` branches.
  - Both checkout `individual` and "solve" and individual excersise.
  - Both commit individual solutions to the `individual`
  - Both checkout the `pair` branch to prepare for pair sprint.
  - One person types a solution to a pair problem and then one person ideates.
  - Typing person commits thier changes to the pair branch.
  - Other person pulls the current code into thier pair branch.
  - Continue...

The entire time it is benificial to field and git questions, and the second time through have the class tell you what to do next.
