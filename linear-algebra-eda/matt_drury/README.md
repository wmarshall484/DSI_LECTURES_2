# Matt's Linear Algebra and Linear Regression Intro Lessons

This contains two lessons that are not too tightly tied together.

## Linear Algebra

Discusses the fundamentals of (computational) linear algebra.  We introduce vectors and matrices, and their implementation in numpy.  Much focus is on solving systems of linear equations, a primary topic in applications.

### Objectives

  - Create vectors and matrices in Python using numpy.
  - Compute the cosine of the angle between two vectors with the dot product.
  - Define linear combination, and describe the space of all linear combinations of a set of vectors.
  - Describe and compute matrix products.
  - Solve systems of linear equations.

## Introduction to Linear Regression

Discusses the basics of linear regression with a simple case study using `insects.csv`.

### Objectives

  - Describe the structure of a linear regression predictive model.
  - Explain how linear regression is solved as an optimization problem.
  - Give a simple interpretation of a fit coefficient in a linear regression model.
  - Use indicator variables to include categorical measurements in a linear regression.
  - Use predictor transformations to capture non-linear effects in linear regression.
