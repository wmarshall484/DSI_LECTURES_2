## Linear Algebra Lecture

I teach all the linear algebra stuff on the whiteboard. Here is my [outline](morning_outline.pdf) to make sure I don't forget anything.

I then switch to [this notebook](linear_algebra_with_numpy.ipynb) and *very briefly* point out that numpy does all these linear algebra stuff. :)

## EDA Lecture & Into to Lin. Reg. Lecture

I go through [this notebook](EDA+intro_to_linreg.ipynb), which goes EDA on an example dataset of cars. That same notebook then motivates linear regression!
