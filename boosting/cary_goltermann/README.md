This lecture is a direct copy of the presentation in the `matt_drury/latex` directory which exists in this directory's parent. In the `matt_drury` directory there are many notes on the format of the slide deck in addition to a notebook that creates all the visualizations for the presentation. The presenation itself was written in latex, the source of which is also in the `matt_drury/latex` directory.

Many thanks to Matt for being awesome!
