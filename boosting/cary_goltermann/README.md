This lecture is a direct copy of the presentation in the [matt_drury/latex](../matt_drury/latex) directory which exists in this directory's parent. In the [matt_drury](../matt_drury) directory there are many notes on the format of the slide deck in addition to a notebook that creates all the visualizations for the presentation. The presentation itself was written in latex, the source of which is also in the [matt_drury/latex](../matt_drury/latex) directory.

Many thanks to Matt for being awesome!

I've also included a summary of the discrete AdaBoost algorithm, the `pdf` and `tex` of which can be found in the [adaboost_notes](adaboost_notes) directory.
