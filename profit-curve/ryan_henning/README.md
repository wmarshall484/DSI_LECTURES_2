## Slides

The original is in [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/189LbZw6OtWIoUHqRIFyJeHlsu-doOfh2ZgGLhdvrtBg/edit?usp=sharing). If you want modifications to this presentation, you may either request them of Ryan Henning, or you may make your own copy. (Attribution: Theses slides are based off Jancsy's.)

The *notes* section for each slide contains the verbal *script*. Many slides are intentionally sparse, so it is important you know the verbal script in order to deliver them properly.

## Boardwork

I start on the board. I present motivation for profit curves + talk about how to calculate expected profit. See [these hand-written notes](profit_curves_notes_bw.pdf).

I then switch to slides and run through the duplicate stuff quickly (since they had just seen it done on the board).
