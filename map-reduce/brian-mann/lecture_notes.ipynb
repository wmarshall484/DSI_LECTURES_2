    "Word Count Notes\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "- WordCount is used as a standard distributed application\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a large number of words it is not solvable on a single machine\n",
    "\n",
    "- A large corpus can require more storage than the disk on a single\n",
    "  machine\n",
    "\n",
    "- A large vocabulary can require more memory than on a single machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- WordCount generalizes to other counting applications: such as\n",
    "  counting clicks by category.\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce Abstractions\n",
    "======================\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Hive and Pig\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of writing MapReduce programs what if we could write SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hive and Pig let you write MapReduce programs in SQL-like languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These are then converted to MapReduce on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will look at Spark SQL later, which fills the same niche.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hive Example\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT user.*\n",
    "FROM user\n",
    "WHERE user.active = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hive\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hive was developed at Facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It translates SQL to generate MapReduce code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Its dialect of SQL is called HiveQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data scientists can use SQL instead of MapReduce to process data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pig Example\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "```pig\n",
    "user = LOAD 'user';\n",
    "active_user = FILTER user BY active == 1;\n",
    "dump active_user;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pig\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pig was developed at Yahoo.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It solves the same problem as Hive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pig uses a custom scripting language called PigLatin instead of SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- PigLatin resembles scripting languages like Python and Perl.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pig is frequently used for processing unstructured or badly formed\n",

    "- What is the advantage of this? It reduces the disk footprint for the\n",
    "  map output. Also it saves network bandwidth.\n",
