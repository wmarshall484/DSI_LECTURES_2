Morning exercise:

* define an arbitrary Python function
  * start with a polynomial
* convert it into a tensorflow-style tensor
* use GradientTape to find the gradient of the output with respect to the input
* Do it for a multivariate function
* Do it for a really wacky function with if statements and loops and stuff
