    "> Vim is often called a \"programmer's editor,\" and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE. ... Vim isn't an editor designed to hold its users' hands. It is a tool, the use of which must be learned.\n",

    "`vim` is the \"`vi` i**M**proved\" editor. `vi` is an old-school Unix text-editor program.\n",

    "- _command mode_\n",
    "\n",
    "In _insert mode_, you get to type into the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "In _command mode_, you get to move the cursor around and instruct vim to do high-level commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, you start in _command mode_. This leads to confusion for all new users who want to immediately begin editing the file. There are many ways to enter _insert mode_ from _command mode_, the most simple way is to press `i` on the keyboard ('i' for insert).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are in _insert mode_, you can type into the document. When you are ready, return to _command mode_ by pressing _escape_ on the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are in _command mode_, let's learn a command. Enter `:w` then press enter. You just saved the file. Now enter `:q` and press enter. You just exited vim. (Btw, you can save _and_ exit with the command `:wq`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever get totally lost in `vim`, just hit _escape_ a bunch then type `:q!`, which tells vim to exit _without_ saving the file."
