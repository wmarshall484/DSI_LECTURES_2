    "Let's start a business: we estimate the fuel economy of cars. People describe a car and pay us money, and we tell them the fuel economy (in miles per gallon) of their car.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first customer comes in, and says, \"This is a very competitive field. Why should we pay you?\"\n",
    "* You say, \"We are very good at what we do.\"\n",
    "* They say, \"Your competitor says the same thing. Do you have evidence?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Note two things.\n",
    "1. **You are competing against other models.**\n",
    "2. **Your model will be evaluated quantitatively.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So you say: \"We have analyzed all of our competitors's predictions. All their predictions have some error; the mean of their predictive errors is 5 mpg. We can do better.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Them: \"Ah, interesting. Prove it.\"\n",
    "* You: \"Describe a car.\"\n",
    "* Them: \"A 2020 hybrid Ford F250\"\n",
    "* You: \"Can't predict - that **that car isn't in our records**\"\n",
    "* Them: \"What good is that?\"\n",
    "* You: \"If you ask about an old car, we can predict it perfectly.\"\n",
    "* Them: \"And...why would we pay for that?\"\n",

    "There exists a quantitative response $Y$ (e.g., fuel economy) which is equal to the function of some properties $X$ (e.g., properties of cars) plus irreducable noise $\\epsilon$ (e.g., manufacturing errors, vehicle wear, variations in vehicle usage).\n",

    "The function $f(X)$ is generally known only to Nature - it is almost always hidden from us.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often possible to obtain a specific $y_i = f(x_i)$ through a relatively expensive process (e.g., building a car with certain properties and then driving it around and measuring its fuel economy). Instead of engaging in an expensive process, we're interested in finding an estimate $\\hat{Y}$ using a _predictive model_ $\\hat{f}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to $f$, $\\hat{f}$ is known to us, because it's a function that we choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal goal of prediction is to find $\\hat{f}$ that **minimizes some error function $E(Y, \\hat{Y})$ on a collection of samples $X$ hidden when $\\hat{f}$ is chosen.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, $E$ was simply the mean absolute difference\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(Y, \\hat{Y}) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{|y_i - \\hat{y_i}|}}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of error function (often called _loss_) is ultimately chosen to model the business logic of the prediction task, but probaby the most common is the _mean square error_:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(Y, \\hat{Y}) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2}}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a number of reasons, chiefly:\n",
    "* It's convex.\n",
    "* It's decomposable into bias, variance, and irreduceable error terms.\n",
    "* There exists a closed form solution to minimize it in the case of a linear $\\hat{f}$.\n",
