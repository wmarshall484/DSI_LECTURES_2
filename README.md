# DSI_Lectures

This repo contains all of the topic lectures for the Galvanize 12-week Data Science Intensive Program.  The folder structure follows the curriculum repo structure by day with a sub-folder system by instructor.  This allows the student to read lecture notes as well as the suggested reading prior to class.
