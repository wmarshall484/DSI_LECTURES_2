# DSI_Lectures

This repo contains all of the topic lectures for the Galvanize 12-week Data Science Intensive Program.  The folder structure follows the curriculum repo structure by day with a sub-folder system by instructor.  This allows the student to read lecture notes as well as the suggested reading prior to class.

This is a large repository; cloning it will take over 4GB (as of December 2018). To speed up the cloning and limit the the size on your computer (at the expense of not having immediate access to older versions of files) you should make a shallow clone with only most recent commit, like this:

```
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:gSchool/DSI_Lectures.git
```
