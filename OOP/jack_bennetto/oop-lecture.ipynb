All these classes behave in similar ways, and we can pass them into functions that expect dictionaries and they will work as they should. Python functions don't check the types of their parameters; as long as they have the right methods they will work ok. This approach is sometimes known as **duck typing**: if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it's a duck.\n",

Most languages handle polymorphism by having one class inherit from another, and objects of the derived class can be used like those of the original class. We can do that in python, and considered doing that above with the MyDefaultDict class, but because python doing care about the types of objects being passed to functions it isn't that important to python."
