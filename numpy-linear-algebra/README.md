# Matt's Numpy and Linear Algebra

This contains two lessons that are not too tightly tied together.


## Numpy

Discusses the fundamentals of manipulating arrays in numpy.

### Objectives

  - Understand how numpy arrays are different from python lists.
  - Create arrays in numpy of a given shape.
  - Use broadcasting to combine arrays.
  - Index into numpy arrays:
    - List style indexing and slicing.
    - Fancy indexing.
    - Boolean indexing.
  - Use some numpy methods to process arrays:
    - Mathematical functions.
    - Aggregations.
    - Aggregation across axies.


## Linear Algebra

Discusses the fundamentals of (computational) linear algebra.  We introduce vectors and matrices, and their implementation in numpy.  Much focus is on solving systems of linear equations, a primary topic in applications.

### Objectives

  - Create vectors and matrices in Python using numpy.
  - Compute the cosine of the angle between two vectors with the dot product.
  - Define linear combination, and describe the space of all linear combinations of a set of vectors.
  - Describe and compute matrix products.
  - Solve systems of linear equations.
