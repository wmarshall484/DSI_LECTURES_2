    "Using functions for maps is super helpful if you want to do a transformation the same way in multiple places, or if the transformation is more complex than something you want to write in a single line.<br/><br/>\n",
    "Broadcast variables are a little bit different.  If you are opperating on a distributed system, the remote cores don't know about the local instances.  You can either pass a local variable to a function, but that variable pay need to be passed hundreds of times to each node depending on the size of the data.  To avoid this needless use of bandwidth, you can create a broadcast variable.  What this does is it sends the variable to all the nodes a single time, so that they can use them whenever you call them.  The only way they differ from the variable, is that you'll need to call the `value` object (you can see it in the 1st line of 'unique_doc_words'\n",
