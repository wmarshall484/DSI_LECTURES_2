# Introduction to Spark

There are two slide decks for my lecture today.

Instructors might find the google docs [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tt9uFjtKvHoUsScd4UHEuwwJYb4ddLi5a7p6XVTD2nk/edit?usp=sharing) and [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x2sHb_7zRwQBaQjLH-eeBxjpRANEtmLYoaQ19rZdIAg/edit?usp=sharing) helpful.
