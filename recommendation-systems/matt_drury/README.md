# Matt's Reccomender System Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of recommender systems.  The morning/afternoon breakdown is clean:

  - Morning: Similarity based recommenders.
  - Afternoon: Content based recommenders and matrix factorization.

This is a nice lesson for later in the course.  It touches on many ideas that have come before and remixes them into a new application (nearest neighbours, similarity measures, matrix factorizations).

## Objectives

  - Describe the main features of a ratings matrix.
  - Use similarity measures between users and items to predict unknown ratings.
  - Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of user-user and item-item approaches.

  - Describe content based recommendation.
  - Discuss drawbacks of content based approaches.
  - Describe matrix factorization based recommenders.
  - Discuss the cold-start problem, and ideas for how to work around it.

## Recommended Reading (Pun SO Intended)

There is a classic ML paper in this domain that everyone should read.  That is [this](http://base.sjtu.edu.cn/~bjshen/2.pdf) paper.  It's nicely written and introduces many important ideas; it is a good paper to get started reading about professional ML.

Also recommended are Ryan Henning's slides [here](https://github.com/gSchool/DSI_Lectures/tree/master/recommendation-systems/ryan_henning).
