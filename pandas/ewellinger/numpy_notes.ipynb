    "# Intro to Numpy \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we're going to start off with a foray into the `Numpy` library, which is one of the fundamental packages for scientific computing in Python. It turns out that the `Pandas DataFrames` we work with are actually built off the `numpy array` (which we'll get to), so it's important to have some basic knowldege of what's running under the hood of our `DataFrames`. \n",
    "\n",
    "While `Numpy` offers an amazing amount of functionality (see the [docs](http://www.numpy.org/) for a better idea), one of it's mainstays is the `numpy array` (an n-dimensional array), which is what we'll focus on. There are loads of things that you can do with `numpy arrays`, and today we'll introduce some of their amazing capabilities. Learning about everything `numpy arrays` can do really just takes working with them day in and day out, and so again we'll try to aim for breadth over depth. We want you to walk away from these notes with an idea of the many things you can do with `numpy` and `numpy arrays`, and the types of situations where you would want to use them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this [cheat-sheet](https://github.com/sallamander/just-enough/blob/master/numpy.md) may come in handy. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why does this matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, `pandas` DataFrames are built on top of `numpy` arrays (in some sense DataFrames are n-dimensional arrays with column names attached). At times, this means that you'll end up working with `numpy` arrays, which means it'll be good to understand what you can do with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The basics of the Array\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's the big deal with Numpy Arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "What's so special about a `numpy array`? From a high level, they are kind of like lists - they just store a bunch of stuff in a container. It turns out, though, that a numpy array is much faster to interact with and perform certain types of calculations with than a standard Python list. Why is that, though? The two main reasons that they are faster are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. They are stored as one contiguous block of memory, rather than being spread out across multiple locations like a list. \n",
    "2. Each item in a numpy array is of the same data type (i.e. all integers, all floats, etc.), rather than a conglomerate of any number of data types (as a list is). We call this idea homogeneity, as opposed to the possible heterogeneity of Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just how much faster are they? Let's take the numbers from 0 to 1 million, and sum those numbers, timing it with both a list and a numpy array."

    "So, numpy runs nearly an order of magnitude faster! This is because of those two points above. Because numpy arrays store data in contiguous blocks of memory, they are able to take advantage of **vectorization**, which is the ability of a CPU to perform one operation on mulitiple pieces of data at once. In addition, since a numpy array knows what type each object it is storing is (and those types don't change), it doesn't have to waste time checking what type each object is (like a list). The combo of these two things speeds up our calcualtion quite a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, too, that we had to specify `np.sum()` - numpy's implementation of sum. When we just used the built-in Python `sum()` on the numpy array, the calculation was actually slower! This is because numpy arrays are optimized for vectorized computations, and when we try to do a non-vectorized operation we pay a price. \n",

Just like we can call the `argmax()` method on a numpy array, we can call `np.argmax()` and pass in a list or tuple. Before we move back to DataFrames, let's look at one last method that is available in `numpy`, `np.where()`. `np.where()` can help us to find what elements in a numpy array meet some condition. "
