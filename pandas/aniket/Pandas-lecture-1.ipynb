    "We're going to look at the Pandas library (created by Wes McKinney). When we refer to working in Pandas, we're typically talking about working within a dataframe, which is what will be our focus. Pandas DataFrames are objects that hold data, allowing us to interact with it, manipulate it, and eventually input it into machine learning algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since a Pandas DataFrame is an **object**, this means that we're going to interact with it in much the same way that we interact with all of our other objects in python. Before we get to actually interacting with DataFrames, though, we'll have to get one, and get one with data in it! There's one quick step that we have to do before that... \n",

This was to note that this is the standard way to import the Pandas library. We should always be sure that if we are importing the entire pandas library, we follow this syntax. It's common practice to use `pd` as the alias, and we tend to follow common practice whenever possible. This makes it easier for others to read our code."

The second is by reading in external data through the pandas module (which we've imported and made accessible via `pd`). For reference, here are the [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) for Pandas DataFrames. \n",

    "Each and every one of our Pandas DataFrames will consist of **rows** and **columns**, where the columns will be denoted and accessed via their names, and the rows will be denoted and access via the indices of the DataFrame. Above, we can look at our columns and see that their names are `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. We can similiary look at our rows and see that they are indexed by `0` and `1`. These column names and indices are how we will access this data later. How did the `DataFrame` constructor take our list of dictionaries and put it into the DataFrame in that format, though?\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Pandas DataFrame constructor encounters a list of dictionaries like we gave it, it interprets each dictionary to be a row in the DataFrame. The keys are read as the column names and the values as the values for each column. By default, the DataFrame constructor will assign a column for **every** key that it sees in **any** dictionary in the list of dictionaries. If a particular dictionary in that list doesn't have a value for that key, then it assigns a `NaN` (stands for not a number) value for that index-column pair. Therefore, when the Pandas DataFrame above got the list of dictionaries, it saw `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` keys, and thus created those columns. It then filled in the values associated with those keys, filling in a `NaN` if it didn't find that key (like it didn't find `d` in the first dictionary in our list). "

    "## A quick look at vizualization in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous libraries available in Python for creating vizualizations. Often times, we will probably be using [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and/or [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) for anything that is general purpose, and then other libraries if we need something more specialized ([Plotly](https://plot.ly/) for dashboards, for example). All of these libraries allow us to build great looking visualizations that can be used in a production setting. If we want something quick and dirty to visualize our data very easily, there is also some plotting functionality built into Pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html), we can see that the plotting available with Pandas will be called via the `plot()` method on a DataFrame object. From there, we'll pass in a bunch of potential arguments to the `plot()` method to specify exactly how to build the plot. The most important of those arguments is the `kind` keyword argument, which tells the `plot()` method what kind of visualization we would like (bar plot, histogram, scatter plot, etc.). Tonight we'll look at one or two examples - since most of the time we'll be doing your visualization in Matplotlib or Seaborn, we'll just give you a taste of what Pandas can do so that you know it's there. We'll look at Seaborn and Matplotlib in a little bit more depth in a later class. "
