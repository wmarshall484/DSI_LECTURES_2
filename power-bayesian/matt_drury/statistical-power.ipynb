    "## Hypothesis Testing: Review and Unanswered Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "We have previously discussed Null Hypothesis Significance testing, a classic and popular procedure for deriving statistical information from data.  Let's review the process quickly:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Null Hypothesis Significance Testing Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State a scientific yes/no question\n",
    "2. Take a skeptical stance: state a null hypothesis\n",
    "3. State the opposite of your null hypothesis: the alternative hypothesis\n",
    "4. Create a probabilistic model of the situation when the null is true\n",
    "5. Determine how surprised you need to be to reject the null: determine a rejection level alpha\n",
    "6. Collect your data\n",
    "7. Calculate the conditional probability of finding a result equally or more extreme than you actually observed, assuming the null is true: this is your p-value\n",
    "8. Compare the p-value to your stated rejection threshold, reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is smaller than your rejection level alpha\n",
    "\n",
    "This whole process rests on our ability to compute a **p-value**\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **p-value** is the conditional probability of observing a result equally or more extreme than we actually observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "In symbols the p-value is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{Observe result equally or more extreme than actual} \\mid H_0) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also observed that the rejection level alpha has a nice interpretation under this scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "> The rejection level alpha is the **false positive rate under the null**.  I.e., if the null hypothesis is true, it is the probability we would collect data that falsely rejects the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this a **false positive** or **type-1 error**.  Clearly increasing alpha results in making more false positive errors, and decreasing alpha will result in less.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **positive** because we rejected the null, which we think of as a positive result (our research hypothesis is true, yay!)\n",
    "  - **false** because we were wrong to do so, the null hypothesis is actually true!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher viewed the p-value as a direct measure of evidence against the null, Neumann and Person viewed the entire procedure as a control on the false positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unanswered Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few points here we have left un-explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bayesian Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "We would really, if at all possible, like to know the probability our research hypothesis is true, given the data we have collected\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(H_{a} \\mid \\text{Data}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **not** what the p-value measures.  Following this path leads us to a new dicipline, Bayesean Statistics, which we will touch on in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Power\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value really only tells us half of the story.  It measures the rate we will falsely adopt positive beliefs, it would be wise to know how often we will flasely adopt negative beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **false negative** or a **type 2 error** is the failure to reject a null hypothesis when it is actually false_.  As we mentioned, decreasing alpha results in less false positives, but there is a trade-off involved: it will *increase* our false negative rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of making a false negative error, given that the null hypothesis is actually false, is called the **false negative rate**, and is denoted by beta\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\beta = P(\\text{Fail to reject } H_0 \\mid H_0 \\text{ is false}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "More common in practice is 1 - beta, called the **statistical power** or just **power**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Power} = P( \\text{Reject } H_0 \\mid H_0 \\text{ is false}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of the relationship between all of these concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "|             | Reject H_0           | Fail to reject H_0\n",

    "### The Effect Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's setup an example we can use to explore the concept of statistical power, we'll continue our theme of Matt's quest to become a better skateboarder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matt would like to increase the height (and therefore stylishness) of his kickflips.  After researching online, it seems like a standard approach is to change the positioning of his front foot.\n",
    "\n",
    "His **current** foot position is like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Current Foot Position](...)\n",
    "\n",
    "this results in low kickflips that skim the ground and rarely gain much height.  His research suggests to changing his foot position like so\n",
    "\n",
    "![Suggested Foot Position](...)\n",
    "\n",
    "This change in position results in Matt dragging his front foot further along the board, and should increase the height of his kickflips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matt's goal is to determine whether this change actually works, does a change in foot position actually increase the height of his kickflips?\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount that the change in foot position *truly* changes the average height of Matt's kickflips is called the **effect size**.  It is the magnitude of the **effect** of the experimental treatment (the change in foot position).  The null and alternate hypothesis can be stated in terms of the effect size\n",
    "\n",
    "> H_0: The effect size is zero.  Changing the foot positioning does not change the average height of Matt's kickflips.\n",
    "\n",
    "> H_a: The effect size is positive.  Changing the foot position increases the height of Matt's kickflips.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assuming A Fixed Effect Size\n",
    "\n",
    "By the central limit theorem, the average heights of Matt's kickflips in any sample is normally distributed.  Assuming the necessary independence, this means that the difference between the mean height with the old foot positioning and the mean height from the new positioning, i.e. the effect size, is also normally distributed.  Under the **null hypothesis** this difference is thus normally distributed centered at zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to say that our difference in heights is also normally distributed under the **alternate hypothesis** but this is not quite true.  The alternate hypothesis does not assume a specific effect size, just that the effect size is positive, so to determine the distribution of difference in average heights we would need to average across *all possible effect sizes* (this is what Bayes theory does).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we **assume a specific, precise effect size**, then the difference in average heights **is** normally distributed.  Under this assumption, our data on mean difference in heights would be generated from a picture like this\n",

    "  - The size of the sample we collect.\n",

    "We've already discussed the relation between the power and the rejection level alpha.  As we decrease alpha we **decrease** the false positive rate, **increase** the false negative rate, and thus **decrease** the power.  We can observe the effect of this by varying the rejection level in our pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Power for Various Values of alpha](images/power-for-changing-alpha.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between effect size and power is straightforward: it is easier to detect larger effects.  That is, as we **increase** the effect size we would like to detect, our power to detect that effect **increases**.  Said differently, it is much harder to detect minute effects than large ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Power for Various Values of Effect Size](images/power-for-changing-effect.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the relationship between sample size and power is what one would expect, though its source is a bit more subtle than the other two relationships.  As we collect more data, we tighten our estimate of the sample mean (or whatever sample statistic we happen to be studying) as the standard error of the estimate decreases.  This tends to better separate the null and alternate distributions, which **increases** the power.\n",
