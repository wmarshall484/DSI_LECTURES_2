“Hey,” the man on the phone said. “Are you still coming tonight?”        


It took a moment for me to realize that he was calling from Distilled to confirm my dinner reservation.        
“Yes,” I replied. “Cool,” he said, and sounded as if he meant it.        
Distilled opened in June on the corner of Franklin Street and West Broadway in TriBeCa, the former home of Drew Nieporent’s Layla and Centrico. The belly dancers and the frozen-margarita machine are gone, but a certain effervescence remains. So does Mr. Nieporent, hovering in the background as guru to Distilled’s owners, the first-time restaurateur Nick Iovacchini and Shane Lyons, the 25-year-old chef.        
The space is blandly handsome, with dark woods and charcoal banquettes, breathlessly high ceilings and quasi-medieval wheel chandeliers like crowns of fire. One side is devoted to the bar, where the drinks, by Benjamin Wood, are lady-killers, elegant with a knife twist. Occasionally 1980s mope rock shimmers from the speakers.        
Service is confoundingly friendly, almost coddling. When I stood outside reading the posted menu, someone came hurrying down the steps to hand me my own copy, so I wouldn’t “crane my neck,” he said. On arrival and departure, a host leapt to open the door.        
The mission statement that preceded one meal (“We are a modern American public house,” the waiter intoned) was both unnecessary and slightly coy about Mr. Lyons’s ambitions. Yes, wings are on the menu, but they are jacked up with gochujang, Korean fermented soybean and chile paste — borrowed, perhaps, from the larder at Momofuku Noodle Bar, where Mr. Lyons worked for a year.        
There are occasional technical flourishes, like watermelon cubes Cryovaced to intensify their flavor, and mushrooms surrounded by puffs of buttery onion soubise, aerated by an iSi siphon. A tousle of dehydrated and shaved bacon adorns an open-face sandwich of heirloom tomatoes and basil on sourdough: a B.L.T., of course. Sunflower sprouts make up for the missing crunch.        
Other classics are updated rather than upended: popcorn dusted with garlic, cumin and brewer’s yeast, which evokes cheese; snappy pickles fermented with gochugaru, Korean red chile powder; pork ribs glazed with more gochujang, teasing the sweet-salty border without straying too far in either direction.        
Onion rings, battered with Yuengling beer and tapioca flour, are fried, then frozen (a theatrical waiter boasted that they had been “brought to negative 60 degrees”) and fried again. They arrive nicely sturdy, the sole purpose of their existence to ferry the narcotic-like condiments, burned scallions cut with jalapeños and mayonnaise with the sting of preserved lime.        
The substantial burger (which the menu modestly refrains from telling you is made with grass-fed, organic-grain-finished beef) is abetted by what may be the finest version of Tater Tots in town, the grated potatoes cooked until just underdone and then crisped with Wondra flour.        
“Everything here goes to 11,” one diner marveled. Duck breaded and fried like chicken is brazen and irresistible, despite the oversweet accompanying waffle, a spongy slab of brioche dredged in custard, like French toast. Even broccoli turns wanton, flung with slivers of duck bacon and pickled watermelon rind in a fish sauce vinaigrette, with (wait for it) a dollop of duck fat.        
But liver pâté served with plumes of baked, dehydrated chicken skin? Now this is confrontational. “My mission in life is to make skinny girls fat,” Mr. Lyons told my table. He got a laugh, but the cracklings were abandoned after one bite.        
The only logical end to such a meal is s’mores — deconstructed, as is the fashion, with a hickory-smoked graham-flour cake, a torched smear of marshmallow fluff, dark chocolate pudding and graham crackers broken on top. It is obvious and no less pleasurable for it. (Kari Rak, previously at Bouchon Bakery, will introduce a new dessert menu this month.)        
Or take a shot of moonshine, with an apricot shrub as a chaser. It edges everything in halos and can make you believe that a modern American public house, whatever that is, is where you want to be.

Recently I attended two extraordinary dinners in New York, one featuring the precise, focused red Burgundies of René Engel and the other the exquisite Côte-Rôties of Marius Gentaz.        


At their best, these are the sorts of wines that amplify the sense of wonder at the heart of greatness. They are reminders that no matter how rationally we try to analyze wines, they show their true measure in the emotions they evoke.        
Engel and Gentaz are great examples of wines that express all the distinctive beauty of their terroirs, enhanced by the personal touch of the winemaker. These two small family estates share another important characteristic: they no longer exist.        
Few passages in family businesses are more difficult to negotiate than the leadership transition from one generation to the next. Ideally, it occurs seamlessly, the parent ceding control to the child while remaining available to offer occasional advice and encouragement. But it may happen abruptly, after sudden illness or death. It may be fierce, as when Oedipal drama interferes with judgment.        
Or, as in the case of Engel and Gentaz, an estate hits a dead end, with no heirs to carry on.        
It’s in the nature of things that estates come and go. Most die off unmourned. Their wines were not distinctive enough, perhaps, to be irreplaceable. Yet for every great estate like Jean-Louis Chave of the northern Rhône, said to have made wine continuously since 1481, the annals are replete with names now consigned to history, their wines to be savored wistfully or sold at auction for outlandish prices born of increasing scarcity.        
Henri Jayer, the legendary Burgundian vigneron, died in 2006 after retiring some years before. His vineyards are now farmed by his nephew by marriage, Emmanuel Rouget, whose wines are well respected but not revered.        
Raymond Trollat was for years the conscience of St.-Joseph, having adhered to traditional, backbreaking agricultural methods as others were taking easier paths. He retired in 2005 with no heirs. I read recently that a bottle of his St.-Joseph had sold at auction for $600, a ridiculous price for what is essentially a rustic but soulful village wine, though perhaps not so ridiculous for the spirit of Raymond Trollat, which is irreplaceable.        
Noël Verset played a similar role in Cornas, maintaining the ancient traditions of this northern Rhône village through many lean years until the rest of the world learned to appreciate the wines. Mr. Verset retired and sold off his vines, his wines surfacing occasionally like eloquent voices from the past.        
Once, a friend opened a bottle of 1979 Barbaresco from Giovannini Moresco, a long-gone producer. What a beautiful legacy, pure, pale and elemental. It came and went so fast, and, sadly, I’ve never seen another bottle.        
Alberico Boncompagni Ludovisi, the prince of Venosa, produced his last wonderful bottles of Fiorano, from his estate within the city limits of Rome, in 1995. That year, for reasons he did not explain, he tore out his vineyard. The prince died in 2005, and after years of legal wrangling, the estate was divided among his heirs, who replanted the vineyard. One day we’ll see whether the new wines bear any relation to the old.        
Continuity is easier in some regions. In Bordeaux, for example, where so many chateaus are in the hands of corporations, it’s more a matter of replacing employees and carrying on. But Bordeaux is not always so corporate. Jean-François Fillastre, the proprietor of Domaine du Jaugaret, one of my favorite small Bordeaux estates, is 70 and has no heirs. I wonder what will happen to it.        
If life were fair, René Engel would still be in the hands of the Engel family. Philippe Engel took over the estate in 1981 from his father, Pierre, who died young, and by all accounts Philippe transformed a good producer into a terrific one. But he, too, died young, of a heart attack at 49 in 2005. With no heirs, it was sold to François Pinault, the billionaire who also owns Château Latour, and is now called Domaine d’Eugénie and is still discovering its personality.        
At the small Engel dinner at DBGB on the Bowery, we drank six bottles of grand cru Burgundy: Clos Vougeots from 1999, ’96, ’91 and ’90, and Grands Échézeauxs from ’99 and ’98. As a group, the wines were elegant, subtle and complex, yet with a touch of rusticity that seemed to give them individuality. The ’98 Grand Échézeaux especially stood out. It was beautifully calibrated and clear, spicy, floral and bursting with energy. The ‘99 Grand Échézeaux likewise showed great finesse, while the Clos Vougeots were richer and plumper, lovely but maybe not with the same sense of intricate detail.        
We toasted the memory of Philippe Engel, and those who had known him told stories of this adventurous man who enjoyed boating, parties and traveling the world.        
By contrast, Marius Gentaz never went far from his home in Ampuis. In many ways, his life had more in common with the 19th century than the 21st.        
He farmed less than three acres on the dizzyingly steep slopes of Côte-Rôtie, and essentially made his wines, labeled Gentaz-Dervieux, by hand. He began in wine in 1947 with his father-in-law, then worked on his own from 1952 until 1993. When he retired, his vines went to his nephew, René Rostaing, who blends them into his excellent Côte-Rôties. But they are not Gentaz-Dervieux.        
At the dinner, put on at Bar Boulud by the Rare Wine Company, an importer, several dozen of us drank 14 vintages from 1993 back to 1978. To drink any one of these bottles could have been the zenith of a wonderful meal; to have 14 was overwhelming. And each seemed to have a story to tell, about a place and a man and a time when life was lived locally.        
Collectively, these were gentle wines, yet with a tensile strength that belied their graceful structure. They were savory and meaty, typical of syrahs from the northern Rhône, yet complex, gorgeously fragrant, mellow yet insistent.        
If I were pressed to reveal my favorites, I would say that I loved the soft ’93, the ripe ’90 and the ethereal ’83. But the ’88 was almost otherworldly in its beauty, while the ’87 was surprisingly open, full and harmonious, and the ’85 still deep and dense with a mosaic of aromas and flavors that have many years to go to express themselves fully.        
It’s bittersweet to drink wines like these, knowing that each opened bottle is one less to go around. Yet it’s also a time to celebrate that part of the human spirit that allows us to see beyond ourselves, knowing that memories travel further than flesh.

‘Shining’ Star: “Doctor Sleep,” Stephen King’s much-­anticipated sequel to “The Shining,” isn’t on the hardcover list yet — its official release date is Sept. 24 — but back in 1977, “The Shining” did spend time there on its way to becoming a cultural touchstone. (It also sold well in paperback, especially after Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film adaptation.)        


“The Shining” was King’s third novel, and both the Book Review and the daily New York Times paid attention, though King might have wished they hadn’t: “To say that Stephen King is not an elegant writer,” Jack Sullivan groused in the Book Review, “is putting it mildly.” The daily’s reviewer, Richard R. Lingeman, wasn’t much kinder: “The evil is slapdash, unfocused and eventually preposterous,” he wrote. “King is a natural, but he lacks control; he simply rears back and lets fly with the fireball, and a lot of wild pitches result.” The criticism apparently stung. “Sales aren’t all-important,” King later told Lingeman. “We all want to be nominated for a National Book Award.” I grew up reading King, and the literary establishment has gradually come around; in 2003, the National Book Foundation awarded him a medal for distinguished contribution to American letters.        
The Ballad of Jail Reading: In next week’s issue, Lauren Groff will review Peter Orner’s new story collection, “Last Car Over the Sagamore Bridge.” Orner has never hit the best-seller list, despite critical acclaim, but he did have a recent brush with the wilder side of popular fiction — as the expert witness in a lawsuit involving a California prisoner’s right to read werewolf erotica. (The plaintiff, an inmate at Pelican Bay State Prison, successfully appealed after his copy of Mathilde Madden’s “Silver Crown” was confiscated.)        
“At stake in the case was the very tricky and very subjective issue of literary value,” Orner told me via e-mail. “As a fiction writer, you can’t really say no when someone asks you to read some werewolf erotica, especially for a good cause. And I’d say the right to read, wherever you are, is a pretty good cause.” Orner ended up “tearing through” the book, he said. “I tend to be a very slow reader. I read ‘The Silver Crown’ fast — the prose really moves, let’s say. I wish I had as much action in my own books.”        
Orner studied law, and has worked in prisons both in a legal capacity and as a writing teacher. He’s sympathetic, he told me, to their challenges. But he would tend to allow most books. “Correctional officers have to enforce discipline in an incredibly tough environment,” he said. “Pelican Bay is one of the most violent prisons in California. . . . They’ve got some extraordinarily serious problems. My humble thought, speaking as a writer, is that an inmate reading a book about werewolves having sex is the least of their problems.”

I had planned to spend a week at the end of the summer on an island off the Sicilian coast. Sunny skies and blue waters were to be followed by a night or two in Palermo and a few days in the countryside visiting Fabrizia Lanza, director of the Anna Tasca Lanza cooking school, where the main activity is picking and cooking vegetables from the garden for every meal.        


Alas, my summer whizzed by, and the vacation became an impossible mission. To console myself, I began to cook.        
With farmers’ market produce at its peak, I can approximate some remembered dishes from previous visits, and Fabrizia’s cookbook “Coming Home to Sicily” fills in the blanks by giving actual recipes to follow. There is an unusual pesto sauce from nearby Trapani, made with basil, coarsely chopped almonds and ripe tomato. There are a zesty eggplant caponata and savory baked eggplant involtini. Not so easy for a city cook to reproduce is a beautiful dish of artichokes roasted on glowing hot embers, but I am going to try.        
The book is arranged by season, so the reader gets a sense of a working Sicilian farm kitchen throughout the year, beginning with the first shoots of wild fennel in the spring, and all the attendant seasonal projects and rituals.        
Of course, there are fish dishes, and meat dishes, too, most imbued with the scent of herbs and garlic. But they have a definite southern sensibility, strikingly different from northern Italian cooking. I found myself drawn to a simple stovetop lamb stew called spezzatino di agnello, seasoned with only a pinch of saffron and a splash of wine, then showered with lots of chopped mint. Fabrizia cuts lamb shoulder into cubes to make this, but since my butcher had beautiful thick-cut shoulder chops, I decided to make mine with those.        
Once assembled, this fragrant stew takes only about an hour to cook. It has a bright-flavored lightness that makes it ideal for these still rather balmy September evenings. I served it with plain boiled potatoes — nothing more was needed.        
While I will remember the summer of 2013 as the one I didn’t spend in Sicily, the meals I’ve been cooking lately have had a distinctly Sicilian accent. This year, it seems the vacation is happening right in my own kitchen.

Before I ate my way around Catalonia, I assumed that the great (and sadly, late) Penelope Casas’ recipe for romesco sauce, from her book “The Foods and Wines of Spain” was the only one I would ever need.        


Deservedly a classic, it’s a rich and piquant purée made from sweet dried Spanish peppers along with tomato, garlic, almonds, vinegar and oil, pounded with breadcrumbs as a binder. It’s marvelous on simply cooked fish, tasty stirred into seafood stews and makes a fine topping for pretty much any vegetable sturdy enough to hold its own against the thick, pungent sauce.        
But once I got to Catalonia, I met romescos of other persuasions.        
Some were spicy and as runny as tomato sauce. Some were as thick as hummus and smoky with charred dried chiles. One memorably complex version, which I’ve written about before, was spiked with sweet almond biscuits and enriched with hard-cooked eggs and garlic confit, then dolloped on slim green onions called calcots.        
None of this is to knock Ms. Casas’s excellent recipe. Nor does it imply that when it comes to romesco sauce, anything goes. But it does give me license to take a few liberties.        
The first is to skip the sweet dried peppers, called noras, that I had always thought were essential. They are indeed very nice, but also hard to come by unless you plan ahead (not my strong suit).        
Instead I substituted broiled red bell peppers. Not only do the fresh peppers add a fleshy sweetness and smokiness from the fire, they are also plentiful this time of year and begging for a noble purpose.        
For a mild kick and to intensify the smokiness, I threw in a bit of smoked hot paprika. And instead of almonds, or a mix of almonds and hazelnuts, I relied solely on hazelnuts for an earthier note.        
The result can be used nearly anywhere a brightly flavored sauce or condiment is required, and will keep in the fridge for at least a week.        
In her various books, Ms. Casas recommends using romesco on grilled tuna, as a sauce for shrimp and lobster or slicked over potatoes and green beans in a substantial salad. Here, I’ve tossed it with quickly blanched broccoli, which is crisp and light, but hearty enough to stand up to this very bold sauce.

SEOUL, South Korea — In the latest sign of a thaw on the divided Korean Peninsula, hundreds of cars and trucks streamed across the border on Monday to take South Korean managers and raw materials back to a jointly operated industrial park in North Korea, where factories resumed production after a 166-day hiatus.        


Operations at the factory complex in the North Korean town of Kaesong came to a halt in early April, when the North withdrew all 53,000 of its workers, blaming tensions with the United States and South Korea.        
The two Koreas reached an agreement in mid-August to reopen the complex, following weeks of negotiations. Technicians from the South have since made day trips across the border to work on the long-idled plants. Separately, South Korean officials have been negotiating with their North Korean counterparts over changes that they hope will make the joint project less vulnerable to political tensions in the future, such as attracting non-Korean investment.        
More than 800 South Korean factory managers and truck drivers entered Kaesong on Monday, as about half of the 123 South Korean-owned factories there began test runs or resumed production, with North Korean employees back at work. Officials from a South Korean lobby group representing the interests of Kaesong factory owners handed out roses to managers at the border crossing to celebrate the occasion. Many of the South Koreans will stay at the site to manage the plants, as they had until South Korea withdrew all of its personnel between late April and early May.        
Since beginning operations in late 2004 as a test case for Korean reunification, the Kaesong complex has slowly grown in size, pairing South Korean manufacturing know-how with inexpensive North Korean labor. Last year, it produced $470 million worth of textiles, shoes, electronics parts and other goods.        
North Korea has agreed to exempt the South Korean-owned factories in Kaesong from taxation this year to help them make up for the millions of dollars lost because of the five-month halt in production. It also agreed to allow more frequent border crossings for South Koreans working at the plants. The North previously opened the border only four times a day for those traveling to and from Kaesong.        
The resumption of production at Kaesong was the most visible sign of easing tensions between the rival Koreas since they traded threats of war last spring, following the North’s latest nuclear test in February.        
Also on Monday, the two governments exchanged lists of names of people who will be allowed to meet with long-lost relatives from across the border, another inter-Korean program that is being resumed. The elderly Koreans, 96 from the South and 100 from the North, will participate in family reunions scheduled to begin on Sept. 25; they are among tens of thousands who have been on a waiting list to be reunited with relatives last seen during the Korean War of 1950-53.

KABUL, Afghanistan — An outspoken female police commander in southern Helmand Province died Monday, a day after being shot by two gunmen, the authorities said. It was the third such attack on a female officer since July.        


The commander, identified as Second Lt. Nigara, died in a hospital in Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital, said the regional medical director, Enayatullah Ghafari. She had been shot in the neck.        
Lieutenant Nigara, who goes by only one name, had just walked out of her home on Sunday when two gunmen on a motorcycle shot her from behind. No one has claimed responsibility, but the authorities blamed drug traffickers or Taliban insurgents.        
The two previous attacks on policewomen were also fatal. All three episodes involved unknown gunmen who attacked during daylight hours in the provincial capital. There are 30 female officers still in the province.        
“The policewomen were active and discovered drugs and foiled terrorists’ plots, and that’s why they are on the top of their targeting lists,” Ahmad Zwak, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said Sunday.        
In an interview this month, Lieutenant Nigara said she was undeterred by the deaths of her two colleagues. She told of living with constant death threats and in near poverty after her brother, also a police officer, was shot and paralyzed. She had been caring for him and his four children, in addition to doing her job.        
“I’m living in a ramshackle house, and whenever I come back there from duty, I smile to my husband that I am alive,” she said.        
She added: “I love this job, and I see my countrymen in trouble and the country in a critical situation, and I feel women’s role is important in policing.”        
Lieutenant Nigara originally joined the force during the communist era in the early 1990s, and she returned after the fall of the Taliban.        
She recounted how in 2006 she stopped a would-be suicide bomber, who was wearing an explosive vest, by throwing her arms around him in a bearhug. She apprehended insurgents and drug smugglers several times, even though they were disguised in burqas. And she said she once climbed onto a rooftop to capture an insurgent sniper.        
“I am receiving threats on a daily basis,” she said. “The smugglers and terrorists are threatening me, saying I should give up, but I tell them that I am an Afghan woman, and I won’t leave the job as long as there is blood in my veins.”        
Mr. Zwak, the provincial spokesman, said the latest attack would not deter the other female officers. “We have a lot of courageous women in the police, and they won’t give up,” he said.        
But a police official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the subject, worried that the shooting of Lieutenant Nigara would serve as a deterrent. “She was the one encouraging female staff to continue working,” he said. “The policewomen were all terrified when the two policewomen were killed.”        
In July, Third Lt. Islam Bibi, who was in charge of the female recruiting department for the Helmand police and was a seven-year veteran of the force, was fatally shot in the back while on a motorcycle with a male relative. She left a husband and seven children. Also in July, Sgt. Shah Bibi, a six-year veteran of the force whose husband, also a police officer, was killed earlier, was shot while shopping in the bazaar. She left four children.        
“These recent assassinations really have had a negative impact on how the policewomen feel,” Lieutenant Nigara said in the interview earlier this month. “I am giving them courage and boosting their morale.”        
She added: “They are really courageous women. None quit their jobs, and I am sure none will, even if things become even worse.”

GIGLIO, Italy — After a costly, painstaking and potentially perilous operation to raise the battered hull of the cruise ship Costa Concordia, engineers said early Tuesday that they had succeeded in righting the ship, removing it from two granite reefs where it ran aground last year, killing 32 people.        


The 19-hour, highly complicated salvage operation had managed to completely rotate the ship, leaning it on an underwater platform built underneath, the engineers said.        
“This was an important, visible step,” Franco Gabrielli, head of Italy’s Civil Protection Agency, told reporters at 4 a.m., accompanied by applause from a few residents who had stayed up all night to follow the operation.        
“The rotation happened in the way we thought and hoped it would happen,” echoed Franco Porcellacchia, project manager for Costa Cruises, the ship’s operator. “There is no evidence so far of any impact to the environment. If there are debris to be removed, we will do it tomorrow.”        
As parts of the vessel emerged in the later afternoon on Monday, discolored and rusting, from the waters where the Concordia had languished, listing on its side, engineers said the operation would most likely take longer than initially planned.        
Salvage experts have said the dimensions of the stricken 951-foot vessel made the operation unparalleled in the annals of marine salvage, as more than 500 divers, technicians, engineers and biologists prepared the ship for what is known as “parbuckling” to bring it upright and minimize environmental risks to Giglio Island, a marine sanctuary.        
Using huge jacks, cables, pulleys and specialized equipment, the salvage effort had been set to begin at first light, but a sudden storm prevented workers from moving a barge and rubber booms close to the ship.        
Three hours after work started, engineers said the first phase of the operation — easing the vessel away from its rocky perch — was going according to plan. “These hours were the most uncertain, as we could not establish how much the hull was wedged,” said Sergio Girotto, project manager with Micoperi, the project’s underwater construction and offshore contractor. “Now we have to guide it into the desired position.”        
The next phase of the salvage, engineers said, involved settling the wreck on an artificial seabed made of bags of cement next to underwater steel platforms. To achieve that, the cruise liner needed to be rotated about 65 degrees, they said. If it all goes well, the ship will be towed away and broken up for scrap by spring.        
The operation was broadcast live on television and the Internet. The Italian news media portrayed the salvage as a chance for Italy to revamp its image after the wreck, in which the captain fled the damaged ship and the evacuation was chaotic.        
The leading national daily, Corriere della Sera, called the shipwreck “a monument to human stupidity” and a “humiliation” for Italy. It said it hoped that the salvage effort would provide a “new and different story” for the country.        
The ship’s captain, Francesco Schettino, is scheduled to go on trial this fall on charges of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning  the vessel before everyone was safe. He has denied wrongdoing. A company official and four crew members have already pleaded guilty to reduced charges.        
Preparations for the salvage operation took 14 months, and the cost has increased to $799 million from $300 million and could rise further, according to Costa Cruises. The Costa Concordia has been stabilized with anchors and cement bags, and underwater platforms have been built on the port side. Salvage crews used pulleys, strand jacks and steel cables placed on nine caissons attached to the left side of the ship to slowly dislodge it on Monday from the two rocks where it had been resting.        
The operation was monitored by engineers and remotely operated vehicle pilots from a control room on a barge close to the bow of the ship. If images or sonar showed dangerous twisting, the technicians could adjust the process. At a command center onshore, engineers could intervene if the ship did not rotate, or did not rotate properly.        
Salvage masters and the Italian authorities had prepared for complications. Most of the fuel was siphoned off within months of the wreck. But the vessel that once transported and entertained 4,229 people still contains chemicals and diesel fuel that could leak into the pristine waters for which Giglio, a popular tourist spot, is known.        
During the rotation process, the region’s environmental agency took samples to monitor water quality.        
“Detaching the ship from the rocks was the most complicated phase, which is probably why they decided to do it very cautiously,” said Emilio Campana, the director of the research office for naval and maritime engineering at Italy’s National Research Council. “We have to keep in mind that the structure is heavily damaged, and see if and how it holds together from now on.”

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel got good and bad news on Sunday from Germany’s economically powerful state of Bavaria: her conservative allies captured an absolute majority in elections for the regional Parliament, but her current liberal partners in the national government failed to make the cut.        


In a race that was scrutinized as an indicator of the national mood before Sunday’s federal elections, the disastrous showing of just 3 percent for the Free Democrats — well short of the 5 percent needed to enter any German legislature — made it less likely that Ms. Merkel would be able to form another coalition government with them after the national vote.        
The Christian Social Union, the Bavarian party that governs in partnership with Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, secured 47.7 percent of the vote in the 180-seat state legislature, according to official results. That would translate into 101 seats for the conservatives, 10 more than needed to form a majority government.        
The conservative parties’ main rivals, the Social Democrats, won 20.6 percent of the vote, or 42 seats, according to the initial official results. That reversed a downward trend, with credit universally given to Christian Ude, a former journalist who has for 20 years been a highly popular mayor of Munich.        
Under Germany’s election system, voters are able to cast two votes, one for a party and one for a candidate. This can lead to results in which the percentage of voters does not always correlate directly with the number of seats a party wins.        
The conservative parties’ main rivals, the Social Democrats, won just over 20 percent of the vote on Sunday, according to the initial official results.        
“The year 2008 is history. We are back,” a beaming Horst Seehofer, Bavaria’s state premier and leader of the Christian Social Union, said minutes after the first exit polls heralded his triumph.        
Five years ago, the Bavarian conservatives lost the absolute majority they had enjoyed for 56 years, turning to the pro-business Free Democrats to form a government that mirrored Ms. Merkel’s coalition in Berlin.        
Sunday’s outcome stirred anxiety in Berlin, where the continuation of Ms. Merkel’s current coalition government is dependent on a strong showing by the smaller party, which has struggled at the national level.        
Despite Ms. Merkel’s comfortable lead in the polls over her main rival, Peer Steinbrück, concerns are growing that she may have no choice but to try to form a government with his center-left Social Democratic Party if the Free Democrats fail to make the crucial 5 percent threshold or barely cross it.        
The Free Democratic Party’s leader, Philipp Rösler, sought to rally supporters nationwide by singling out Bavaria as unique.        
“We all know that things are different in Bavaria, and from now on, it’s all about Germany,” Mr. Rösler said, adding that “this result is a wake-up call.”        
The Greens received about 8.5 percent of the vote, while the Free Voters, a Bavarian party that opposes Germany’s euro-zone policy, hovered around 9 percent, the state election monitor said on its Web site.        
“The mood for a change in the land was just not there,” said Theresa Schopper, a Greens leader in Bavaria, in an unusually frank assessment. Her party has struggled nationally this year, in part because of a poorly communicated message widely seen as raising taxes for many.        
The conservatives’ strong showing will not necessarily translate into equal success for Ms. Merkel next week. There is some fear that Bavarians, who make up Germany’s second-strongest voting bloc, could be less inclined to go to the polls two weeks in a row. And those who want to see the Free Democrats hang on may well use their second party vote that way rather than casting it for Ms. Merkel’s party. At her party’s headquarters in Berlin on Sunday night, the tension was palpable.        
In addition, Mr. Seehofer’s strength could prove a problem for Ms. Merkel even if she is returned to office. His interpretation of conservatism has remained more traditional, while she has steered her party toward more leftist issues, like creating more publicly run day care centers and deciding to shut down Germany’s nuclear power plants.        
While Bavaria’s capital, Munich, has become a diverse metropolitan area, home to some of Germany’s most powerful industrial and high-tech companies, much of the rest of the state is rural and socially conservative. The area still holds strong ties to the Roman Catholic Church and its unique cultural identity, stemming from its history as an independent kingdom.        
Bavaria has the lowest unemployment rate of Germany’s 16 states, with only 3.8 percent of its 12.5 million inhabitants out of work, and there has been growing unease in the state with Germany’s system under which economically stronger states distribute some of their tax earnings among weaker regions.

LONDON — In an old church annex in northwest London, the walls of the Cutler & Gross offices are lined with colored eyewear that looks like fragments of stained-glass windows.        


The analogy is apt as, ever since 1969, when the opticians Graham Cutler and Tony Gross set up a store in the upscale Knightsbridge district, the brand has exhibited an almost religious fervor about handmade glasses.        
Today, with the 30-year veteran Marie Wilkinson as its design director, the company continues to sell its own 1,000 styles while expanding relationships with some of fashion’s trendiest designers.        
The licenses with Giles Deacon, Thomas Tait, Victoria Beckham and Maison Martin Margiela are not especially lucrative, says Majid Mohammadi, the company’s co-owner and chief executive. But they do allow the eyewear maker to develop designs with like-minded creative people, who buy the glasses for resale under their own labels.        
“Working on eyewear helps designers articulate their point of view, and they, in turn, are ambassadors for wearing glasses,” Ms. Wilkinson explains.        
Mr. Deacon said he had been wearing the company’s logo-free frames for years before he approached the executives in 2009, seeking a collaboration.        
“I have always really respected the quality and the simplicity of the designs that they make,” he says. “They come from an aesthetic which is just a bit different from the norm, which I think is really attractive.”        
He adds that he feels comfortable sharing his offbeat references — from Kurt Cobain to the Scooby-Doo character Velma — with someone like Ms. Wilkinson.        
For Mr. Deacon’s spring 2013 collection, Cutler & Gross created oversize, rounded glasses that featured inlaid pearls and crystals above the brow.        
As Mr. Mohammadi describes it, the designers value the company’s quality-over-quantity approach. “We can’t do mass production and distribution. We are like Savile Row suits rather than Boss suits,” which, he continues, “may be very good, but they’re not handmade — that’s the bottom line.”        
Everything from milling lens grooves to fitting hinges is done by its craftsmen in Italy, where the brand owns two factories. The second site, established only this year in the northern city of Cadore, has allowed specialists like metalworkers or artisans who cut acetate to work together.        
But with production based in Italy, why keep the design team in London?        
It comes down to the heritage, says Ms. Wilkinson, and “the English mixture of irreverence and correctness” that was a hallmark of designs by Mr. Cutler and Mr. Gross.        
A pair of Cutler & Gross sunglasses might retail for £350, or about $560 — compared with the £220 that Gucci might charge — but “the difference between the production cost is massive,” says Mr. Mohammadi.        
He will not be specific, but he acknowledges the brand’s margins are significantly smaller than those of larger companies while adding that it spends nothing on promotion or marketing.        
Mr. Mohammadi, who owns the business with Mr. Cutler (Mr. Gross had a stroke and retired in 2009), predicts the new factory will double the brand’s production capacity, helping to meet demand in the brand’s 600 points of sale in 60 countries, including a newly opened store on Mercer Street in the Soho neighborhood of New York.        
As for further expansion, the brand has vague plans for more stores. Mr. Mohammadi says it “should open in Tokyo and Milan, but I’m not in a rush. It took me three years to open one in New York. As a cash-rich private company, if we want to open a store, we’re not at the mercy of anyone. We take our time.”

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korean soldiers shot and killed a man who was making a rare attempt to enter North Korea from the South, the Defense Ministry said Monday.        


The man, wearing civilian clothes, jumped into the Imjin River where it meets the western end of the border between the Koreas before it empties into the Yellow Sea, according to a ministry spokesman, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity until his office made a formal announcement. The man ignored warnings from South Korean border guards to turn around, the spokesman said.        
“We had to shoot to stop him,” he said. “We retrieved his body, and we are trying to find out who he is and what was his motive.”        
Cases of people trying to cross the North-South border are rare. It is heavily mined and guarded by layers of barbed-wire fences and hundreds of thousands of soldiers on each side.        
And South-to-North crossings are extremely unusual. The last known case was in 2009, when a South Korean wanted on assault charges sneaked past border guards to defect.        
While about 25,000 North Koreans have defected to the South since a famine hit their country in the 1990s, most of them go through China. But they occasionally cross the North-South border.        
Last September, a North Korean civilian defected by swimming across the Imjin and crawling through a military fence along the border west of Seoul. The next month, two North Korean soldiers defected, one of them after killing two of his officers. Last month, an unarmed North Korean defected to a South Korean island where the Imjin joins the Yellow Sea.

PARIS — Secretary of State John Kerry and the foreign ministers of France and Britain said on Monday that they would not tolerate delays in dismantling Syria’s chemical weapons and would press ahead with a strong resolution in the United Nations Security Council to enforce the disarmament plan.        


“It is extremely important that there are no evasions,” William Hague, the British foreign secretary, said at a joint news conference.        
Referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Mr. Kerry said, “If Assad fails in time to abide by the terms of this framework, make no mistake, we are all agreed — and that includes Russia — that there will be consequences.”        
A major question, however, is whether the United States and its allies are pursuing the short-term goal of dismantling Syria’s chemical arsenal at the expense of their ultimate objective of pressing Mr. Assad to relinquish power.        
The schedule for eliminating Syria’s chemical weapons is ambitious: all of them are to be eliminated by the middle of 2014. And experts say that meeting such a schedule will depend heavily on the cooperation of the Assad government.        
Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, insisted that there was no contradiction between the disarmament goal and the longer-term diplomatic objective, because removing Mr. Assad’s chemical arsenal would undermine his military position and would eventually smooth the way for his ouster.        
“It will be a weakening of his position,” Mr. Fabius said. “He must understand that there is no military victory.”        
Mr. Kerry made a similar point. “We are taking a weapon away from him that he has been using against his people,” he said, while acknowledging that the Syrian military had also used conventional artillery and airstrikes indiscriminately against the population.        
Mr. Fabius emphasized the importance of increasing support for the Syrian opposition, much of which has expressed a sense of betrayal over the United States’ decision to put off a military strike.        
“In order to negotiate a political solution, we need a stronger position,” Mr. Fabius said. “We therefore intend to strengthen our support to Syrian national coalition rebels. If you want to change the Assad regime without falling in the hands of the terrorists, you have to support the moderate opposition.”        
Mr. Fabius remarked that much of the public appeared to think that the choice in Syria was between Mr. Assad’s government and Islamic militants, but he said that was false.        
Mr. Fabius said the Syrian opposition would be invited to an international meeting in New York that would be convened on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, whose formal session opens next week and is scheduled to continue into early October.        
The framework plan on quarantining and destroying Syria’s chemical arsenal was worked out by the United States and Russia on Saturday but now needs to be incorporated into a Security Council resolution.        
Under the framework agreement, the terms of the accord are to be included in a resolution under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, which would authorize punitive measures if Syria does not comply. While Russia would almost certainly veto any Security Council endorsement of a military strike, other measures could include disrupting Syria’s means of communications as well as imposing economic sanctions.        
In addition, Mr. Kerry has said the United States remains prepared to launch a unilateral strike if Syria fails to meet its commitments.        
Mr. Kerry said that every representation of compliance by the Syrian government would be verified. “Nothing can be accepted at face value or in words alone,” he said.        
Mr. Hague added that Britain, France and the United States were intent on preventing Syria from engaging in a “cat-and-mouse game.”        
“The pressure is on them to comply with this agreement in full,” he said. “The world must be prepared to hold them to account if they don’t, and our three countries are certainly determined to do so.”

NEW DELHI — India’s main inflation rate hit a six-month high in August, driven by a surprise surge in food prices, hardening the case for the central bank’s governor, Raghuram Rajan, to keep interest rates high at his first policy meeting this week.         
Food inflation accelerated to a three-year high of 18.18 percent in August, government data released on Monday showed, driving overall inflation to a higher-than-expected 6.1 percent.        
Recent government moves to increase fuel prices also drove the jump in the wholesale price index, the price of a representative basket of wholesale goods.        
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a headline reading of 5.8 percent, compared with 5.79 percent in July. The main, or headline, inflation rate includes food prices, which are often volatile.        
Late planting and disruptions in the supplies of vegetables, including onions, because of heavy summer rains have fueled food inflation. Onion prices jumped 51 percent from July to August.        
Monday’s release was the last major data point before Mr. Rajan, a former I.M.F. chief economist, holds his first policy meeting Friday.        
“Developments in the currency market suggest that R.B.I. should be in a position to start reversing its tightening measures. However, they have to be careful, as market could interpret it as tolerating higher inflation,” said A. Prasanna, an economist with ICICI Securities Primary Dealership in Mumbai, referring to the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India.        
The higher inflation number dampened market expectations that Mr. Rajan would begin to roll back some of the measures put in place by his predecessor in a bid to arrest a sharp decline in the rupee since May.        
He has already warned he does not have a “magic wand” to deal with India’s economic crisis, but as he has been dubbed the Guv by a gushing Indian media, hopes are high he can find a formula to stabilize the rupee, calm inflationary pressure and at the same time set off a revival in economic growth.        
Before he reveals his monetary stance, Mr. Rajan will first have to deal with the outcome of a pivotal meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Fed is likely to announce measures to rein in its huge economic stimulus. Fears of an expected policy tapering have already set off an emerging-market sell-off, contributing to the rupee’s fall to a record low.        
The Fed is expected to reduce its $85 billion a month bond-buying program, but financial markets are uncertain about the extent of the reduction.

PARIS — Policy makers are hoping a general election next Sunday in Germany will allow the important business of integrating Europe to finally move forward, but they hardly expect a radical shift in Germany’s stance on major issues.         
From Athens to Lisbon and Paris to Rome, governments want Berlin get behind a banking union and also adopt a more expansionist economic policy to help drive growth and fight unemployment in stagnant euro zone economies.        
European officials largely expect Chancellor Angela Merkel to win a third term. Many hope that Ms. Merkel, a conservative, will have to form a grand coalition with the center-left Social Democrats, or S.P.D., whose pro-Europe leanings tend to make them more open to stimulus measures than the current partner in the governing coalition, the center-right Free Democratic Party, or F.D.P.        
But even if Ms. Merkel is forced to team up with the more liberal S.P.D., Germany’s stance on major European issues is unlikely to shift.        
“Whoever is elected, the constraints that Merkel has faced will remain the same for any German government,” said Sylvie Goulard, a French representative to the European Parliament, who is a member of the liberal Democratic Movement party.        
Hostile public opinion and institutions that strictly interpret European Union laws will continue to bind Germany’s movement, making it difficult for the government to share the financial burdens of fellow euro zone members.        
Ms. Merkel and her S.P.D. challenger, Peer Steinbrück, barely mentioned European and foreign policy in their only television debate, except to agree that Germany should have no part in any military response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria.        
Mr. Steinbrück accused Ms. Merkel of bungling the euro zone crisis by going slow and inflicting a poisonous dose of austerity measures on Greece and other bailed-out countries. He kept silent about S.P.D.’s support for pooling some euro zone debts, sensing a vote-loser.        
The chancellor noted that the S.P.D. had voted for all of her euro zone bailout proposals, but she offered no personal vision of Europe’s future.        
With the survival of the common currency no longer under threat and financial markets calm for now, policy makers expect Ms. Merkel to stick to her “small steps” approach to euro zone integration unless the crisis flares again.        
The need for further financial support for Greece, Portugal and perhaps Ireland will cause much grumpy debate in Berlin. Frustration at chronic Italian political instability and French aversion to liberal economic changes will smolder.        
Perhaps as important for German policy as the election result may be a ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court next month on the European Central Bank’s efforts to hold euro zone member’s borrowing costs in check by buying their bonds, which calmed the crisis when the E.C.B. president, Mario Draghi, announced the initiative last year.        
The German court is not expected to declare the bond buying illegal, but it may set conditions that could make the policy hard to implement.        
“Germany will build Europe at its own pace and on its own terms. The others need to swallow and understand this,” said Ulrike Guérot, who represents Germany on the European Council on Foreign Relations. “If they try to rush us, it will take longer.”        
At the same time, Berlin is expected to continue to insist that Europe be given binding control over national budgets as a condition for providing financial support to other euro zone members, she said.        
Divergent views held by Germany and the rest of the world as to the cause of the European debt crisis will also slow any progress.        
“We Germans talk about respect for rules and constitutional legality,” Ms. Guérot said. “The French talk about the need for a European strategy and solidarity. The British and Americans talk about rebalancing the economy and want ‘Big Bazooka’ solutions.”

The U.S. Federal Reserve remains the most powerful central bank in the world. Its policy actions reverberate in every corner of the globe, something no other central bank can claim. Even the hint of a “taper” — the withdrawal of easy money policies — has roiled emerging markets. The prospect of rising interest rates in the United States has led investors to pull back from riskier investments in those countries. Emerging markets like Brazil, India and Indonesia are facing plunging currencies and declining stock markets.        


Low interest rates in the United States had led investors to look to emerging markets for better returns on their money, fueling booms in equity and real estate markets as well as higher inflation in some countries. For the previous two years, emerging markets had been complaining about how these inflows fueled by cheap money in the United States caused their currencies to appreciate too rapidly, hurting their export competitiveness. The fact that those same currencies are now tumbling has led to the opposite complaint — that the Fed should back off more slowly from its earlier policies and better communicate its intentions to financial markets.        
Given the global impact of the Fed’s actions, the choice of a replacement for Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve is being watched with keen interest. No matter who is chosen, there are important changes in store for central banks and financial markets the world over.        
Despite the global economic crisis, financial markets are now more closely connected then ever before. China, India and other major economies have continued removing restrictions to capital flows, opening up their markets to cross-border investment. Given this increased mobility, actions by any of the major central banks have effects well beyond their own national borders.        
Moreover, in the aftermath of the crisis, central banks have become even more important to economic management, taking on much of the burden of controlling inflation, improving financial stability and promoting growth. This is a difficult balancing act in the best of times. It becomes virtually impossible when fiscal and other policies are working at cross-purposes.        
In the United States, for instance, short-term fiscal tightening (along with the uncertainty associated with deficit and debt-ceiling negotiations that repeatedly go down to the wire) has hobbled the recovery. Meanwhile, little has been done to tackle the longer-term fiscal problems, especially entitlement spending. The focus on short-term austerity has limited productivity-enhancing expenditures in such areas as infrastructure and education.        
In India, the government has been unwilling to undertake politically unpopular reforms to tackle large budget deficits and structural problems such as stifling labor-market regulations. This has left it to the makers of monetary policy to do all the heavy lifting. Other emerging markets face similar issues.        
The reliance on central banks to make up for the failings of other policies has created inevitable international tensions. The right monetary policy for one country might not necessarily be what is good for another. Unlike fiscal policies, whose effects tend to stay mostly domestic, monetary policies do affect currency values and financial markets in other countries through cross-border financial flows.        
Whoever takes over from Bernanke, the reality is that the Fed chairman has a mandate to focus only on domestic objectives. Fair enough: No central bank in the world has anything but domestic objectives in its mandate. But when the Fed acts, it matters to the world in a way that no other central bank’s actions do.        
In a report by a committee of academics and former central bankers in which I participated, we argued that the Fed and a small group of central banks from both advanced and emerging market economies should hold regular meetings and issue a report on their monetary policy intentions. Even if this procedure only exposed mutual inconsistencies in policy, it would be a way to bring broader pressure on politicians to stop relying on the crutch of monetary policy and prod them to take politically unpopular measures to improve productivity and the prospects of long-term growth while making global capital flows more stable.        
So who would the rest of the world vote for to head the most important central bank? Now that Lawrence Summers has withdrawn from the race, the presumptive front-runner is Janet Yellen. Many central bankers view her as someone who is empathetic to the spillover effects of U.S. policies, someone who has enough credibility to soothe financial markets and ably steer the Fed.        
In any event, no matter who gets the job, what many of the world’s central bankers are hoping for is a Fed that can go back to the more modest objectives of maintaining low inflation and financial stability. On that, at least, there is certainly international agreement.

Throughout my youth, the superpowers battled each other via proxies in regional wars or via their respective secret services. On Friday, I awoke to find them battling each other on your Views pages in the form of an article by President Vladimir Putin, “A plea for caution from Russia.” There will always be wars. And we’re likely to see more efforts to attain and deploy weapons of mass destruction. But, so long as the superpowers duel in the newspaper, the prospects for both peace and the press would appear to have brightened.

In “That threat worked” (Sept. 13), Nicholas D. Kristof suggests a three-track strategy in Syria that includes expanded support of “moderate” rebels. That is precisely the wrong strategy. It is not in America’s interest to see a rebel victory, which will bring either Islamic militants to power or chaos.        
Our choice isn’t between bad and good, dictatorship and democracy; it’s between bad and worse. To that end, we should not arm the rebels — moderate or otherwise. Many of the rebels may be moderates, even believers in some form of democracy (without the slightest notion of what that is or how to get there). But many are also Islamic extremists bent on doing away with a secular regime.        
The best outcome for the United States, and I believe for the Syrian people, would be a negotiated settlement in which President Bashar al-Assad or his government remains in power but with some form of constraint.

President Obama recently declared that the United States is “the world’s oldest constitutional democracy,” and he is echoed by Timothy Egan (“A brilliant mess,” Sept. 14), without challenge. It is, nonetheless, a historically dubious claim. That honor might belong to either Iceland or Switzerland, though the details are open to debate. But since the United States did not allow equal voting rights for all its citizens until 1965, its democracy, by that standard, must be counted young. And true democracy still eludes the country when money is considered a form of free speech and representation of the poor is subject to open mockery.

DENVER — As rain continued to fall Monday along Colorado’s Front Range, officials waited for a clearing in the weather so National Guard helicopters grounded by rain and fog could resume searching for hundreds of people who remain cut off by floodwaters.        


Officials said that they had not yet determined when the helicopter rescue flights could proceed, but the authorities have told residents isolated in Lyons, Jamestown and other mountain towns that once the helicopters were in the air that they should do what was necessary, within reason, to get the attention of the National Guard pilots. Among the suggested methods are to wave or place a white sheet on the roof of their house, light signal flares or small fires, or redirect the sun with mirrors.        
Residents needing evacuation were also asked to be pack medication or clothes they might need because it could be days or weeks before they are allowed to return home.        
Telephone landlines, cellphone service and the Internet have either been knocked out in the area or are undependable. Given the risk of further mudslides and the amount of mud, water and debris that have piled up in some places, even walking a few feet can prove difficult, officials said.        
The rain, which has been falling on the Front Range for much of the past week, prompted fears of new flooding Monday as the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch starting Monday afternoon and extending into the early evening hours in anticipation of heavy thunderstorms expected to roll through the area. Some of the storms could bring as much as one inch of rain in as little as 30 minutes, the weather service said in an advisory.        
W. Craig Fugate, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was scheduled to arrive Monday to help coordinate relief efforts, the agency said.        
The storms have left at least six people dead or presumed dead so far, the most recent reported fatality being that of an 80-year-old woman who was apparently washed away with her home.        
More than 800 people are now listed as “unaccounted for” in Larimer and Boulder Counties, the authorities said. Officials said they hoped that most of those people had simply been unable to reach friends and family members because of the limited ability to communicate.        
On Sunday, National Guard pilots waited all day for the fog to lift, but were unable to get off the ground at Boulder Municipal Airport and elsewhere.        
“The good news is we’ve got 16 helicopters,” said John Schulz, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office in Larimer County. “The bad news is they can’t go anywhere.”        
A break in the relentless rains had brought dramatic scenes of rescue and reunion on Saturday, as big-bellied Chinook helicopters buzzed over the flooded roadways to airlift hundreds of residents from campgrounds, homes and destroyed mountain hamlets. One mission rescued 85 children and 14 adults who had been trapped while attending an outdoor education camp near Jamestown.

MOSCOW — A Russian nuclear submarine caught fire and was spewing smoke into the air at a port city in Russia’s Far East early Monday, but fire crews extinguished the blaze, and the authorities said no radiation leaked.        


Two nuclear reactors were on board, but they had been shut down before the fire started.        
Crews had also removed the arsenal of torpedoes and missiles, so there was no risk of an explosion, Russian military officials said, according to the Interfax news agency.        
The submarine, called the Tomsk, was docked at a shipyard near Vladivostok for repairs.        
The crew evacuated after smoke started to fill the boat, the RIA news agency reported. And photographs showed smoke billowing from vents along the submarine’s sides.        
Concerns about radiation leaks into the Pacific Ocean are high after the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster in Japan two years ago. And for the Russians, any submarine accident rekindles memories of the sinking of the Kursk in the Barents Sea in 2000, when some crew members were trapped alive for days but did not survive.        
The Russians said the Kursk went down after one of its torpedoes exploded, but the blast did not rupture the hardened reactor segments of the submarine to release radiation.        
Vows to improve safety followed, but lean post-Soviet military budgets continued to strain the Russian Navy. Under a modernization plan, Russia intends to spend 5 trillion rubles, or $166 billion, repairing and replacing naval vessels over the next eight years.        
Sparks from welding during work to repair and upgrade the Tomsk most likely caused the fire on Monday, RIA reported, quoting Aleksei Kravchenko, a spokesman for the United Shipbuilding Corporation, the state-owned company doing the work.        
The submarine has two hulls. An inner hull is thick enough that the interior of the submarine can be maintained at the pressure of the surface, even when deep underwater. The reactors are inside this pressurized hull.        
A space for ballast tanks and other equipment separates this rigid cylinder of metal from the thin outer hull.        
The fire broke out between the two hulls, Mr. Kravchenko said, separated from the two nuclear reactors by the thick inner hull. It burned paint and insulation. Firefighters extinguished it with foam, reports said.        
The Tomsk is an attack submarine and, as such, would not carry strategic nuclear warheads even if all the weaponry had not been removed from the boat for the repairs. It was never threatened by the fire, the Russian authorities asserted.        
An American nuclear submarine, the Montpelier, collided with a ship in 2012, and a British nuclear submarine, the Astute, beached on a sandbar in 2010. Fires broke out on Russian nuclear submarines in 2011 and in 2008 without causing a radiation leak.

1913 China Will Reform Salt Gabelle 
PEKING — The Premier to-day [Sept. 16] notified the Ministers of the five Powers interested in the loan negotiations that a reorganization of the salt gabelle will be undertaken, in accordance with the stipulation of the loan agreement. This dispels the allegation that the Government had determined to obstruct the reform, although it deprives it of the chief excuse for the inauguration of a debt commission to control China’s finances, arrangements for which have been under serious consideration recently. The Japanese regard China’s formal Note accepting most of their demands, made as a result of the Nanking and other recent incidents, as unsatisfactory.        
 
1938 Plebiscite Rejected by Czechs  
PRAGUE — Rudolf Bechyne, Vice-Premier of Czechoslovakia, warned publicly tonight [Sept. 16] that this country would go to war before it would allow a plebiscite in the Sudeten German areas. “That would be the shortest way to war,” he said, at a time when Czech newspapers were reporting that France and Great Britain favored a plebiscite under international control. “There could not be found in Czechoslovakia a government which would accept a plebiscite. If by any chance such a government could be found it would be smashed within an hour by the indignation of the whole nation, which would rather accept death than the crippling of the homeland.” This appeal came at a time when the Sudeten areas were quietly under the iron rule of martial law.        
 
1963 Schema on Nature of Church 
VATICAN CITY — The first schema, or project, to be discussed at the second session of the Ecumenical Council will concern the nature of the Roman Catholic Church, the Council Secretariat announced today [Sept. 16]. The scheme will make the expected 2,500 Council fathers come to grips with some of the most important problems of the Second Vatican Council as soon as they arrive. The fathers are considered likely to spend a great deal of time on this central schema, which has been described as “the foundation of the entire Council.” The schema was brought before the Council at the first session last spring, but was rejected as too juridical and not pastoral enough in tone. Now, “De Ecclesia” concerns such weighty theological problems as the nature of the Church, the infallibility of the Pope, and the rights of each element of the Church, from the Pope to the layman.

WASHINGTON — A former Navy reservist killed at least 12 people on Monday in a mass shooting at a secure military facility that led the authorities to lock down part of the nation’s capital — even after the gunman was killed — in a hunt for two other armed men spotted by video cameras, officials said.        


But by Monday evening, the federal authorities said they believed the shooting was the act of a lone gunman, identified as Aaron Alexis, 34, who was working for a military subcontractor.        
The chaos at the facility, the Washington Navy Yard, started just after 8 a.m. Civilian employees described a scene of confusion as shots erupted through the hallways of the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters, on the banks of the Anacostia River a few miles from the White House and about a half-mile from the Capitol.        
“I heard three gunshots, pow, pow, pow, straight in a row,” said Patricia Ward, a logistics management specialist from Woodbridge, Va., who was in the cafeteria on the first floor when the shooting started. “About three seconds later, there were four more gunshots, and all of the people in the cafeteria were panicking, trying to figure out which way we were going to run out.”        
Police officers who swarmed the military facility exchanged fire with Mr. Alexis, 34, a former naval reservist in Fort Worth. Police officers shot Mr. Alexis to death, law enforcement officials said, but not before a dozen people were killed and several others, including a city police officer, were wounded and taken to local hospitals.        
Officials said Mr. Alexis drove a rental car to the base and entered using his access as a contractor and shot an officer and one other person outside Building 197, the Sea Systems Command headquarters. Inside, Mr. Alexis made his way to a floor overlooking an atrium and took aim at employees eating breakfast below.        
“He was shooting down from above the people,” one law enforcement official said. “That is where he does most of his damage.”        
The names of seven of the victims were released late Monday: Michael Arnold, 59; Sylvia Frasier, 53; Kathy Gaarde, 62; John Roger Johnson, 73; Frank Kohler, 50; Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46; and Vishnu Pandit, 61. Officials said names of the other victims would be released after their families had been contacted. All of the victims were believed to be civilians or contractors. No active duty military personnel were killed, said Chief Cathy L. Lanier of Washington.        
One victim was shot in the left temple and was pronounced dead within a minute of arriving at George Washington University Hospital. “This injury was not survivable by any stretch,” a hospital official told reporters. “The patient was dead on the way to the hospital.”        
Eight people were injured. Three of them were shot, including Officer Scott Williams of the Washington police. The others suffered injuries from falls or complained of chest pains. Officer Williams, who served in the canine unit, underwent several hours of surgery for gunshot wounds to his legs. A second victim suffered a gunshot wound to her shoulder. A bullet grazed a third victim’s head but did not penetrate her skull, according to doctors at MedStar Washington Hospital Center.        
Three weapons were found on Mr. Alexis: an AR-15 assault rifle, a shotgun and a semiautomatic pistol, a senior law enforcement officer said. It was unclear whether he had brought all the guns with him, another law enforcement official said, or if he had taken one or more of them from his victims.        
Officials said they were still searching for a motive as they asked the public for help by posting pictures of Mr. Alexis on the F.B.I. Web site. The agency is treating the shooting as a criminal investigation, not one related to terrorism.        
Navy officials said late Monday that Mr. Alexis had worked as a contractor in information technology. A spokesman for Hewlett-Packard said Mr. Alexis had been an employee of a company called The Experts, a subcontractor on an HP Enterprise Services contract.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 19, 2013An article on Tuesday about the mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard, using information from law enforcement authorities, misstated, in some copies, the circumstances under which the gunman, Aaron Alexis, entered the facility before the shooting began. He used his valid credentials as a military contractor to get into the base. He did not “shoot his way in.”

Business,"










Stock and bond markets around the world jumped on Monday, after Lawrence H. Summers withdrew from consideration as chairman of the Federal Reserve.         
The equity surge began in Asia a few hours after Mr. Summers wrote President Obama that “any possible confirmation process for me would be acrimonious” and thus not in the nation’s best interests.        
The rally rolled across Europe and gained steam on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average surged by 1 percent, before pulling back modestly. It closed at 15,495, up nearly 0.8 percent, or about 119 points. The broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 0.6 percent for the day.        
Mr. Summers’s unexpected move on Sunday came shortly before the American central bank meets to decide whether to scale back its bond purchases, or quantitative easing, from the current pace of $85 billion a month.        
The decision left many analysts’ short list for leading candidates for the Fed leadership down to just Janet L. Yellen, the current No. 2 under the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, whose term expires in January.        
Ms. Yellen was perceived by some in the financial markets as likely to maintain the current course, rather than move quickly to scale back the Fed’s years-long economic stimulus efforts.        
Christian Schulz, an economist in London with Berenberg Bank, said investors’ concerns about Mr. Summers stemmed from the fact that he had not spoken much on the topic of monetary policy, while Ms. Yellen had a long track record of supporting Mr. Bernanke’s policies.        
Mr. Summers “seemed less convinced that such a blunt instrument as quantitative easing was the right tool,” Mr. Schulz said. “It was clear he wasn’t as big a fan.”        
“It seems likely that President Obama will choose Yellen, which is good in terms of the prospects of the Fed staying on hold for some time,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York, according to Reuters.        
“Of course, there are always chances that the Fed may begin to announce the trimming on Wednesday, but that’s already been baked in the market,” Mr. Cardillo said.        
Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of the investment firm Pimco, said in a blog post that the Summers move would be seen “as bullish for U.S. interest rate curve trades, duration more generally, and risk assets (including credit and equities).”        
The main Hong Kong stock index pushed ahead 1.5 percent, while Germany’s DAX reached a new high, gaining 1.1 percent.        
But emerging markets were the most relieved by Mr. Summers’s retreat. Equity indexes in Indonesia (up 3.4 percent), the Philippines (2.8 percent), Argentina (2.1 percent) and Singapore (1.9 percent) were among the sharpest gainers.        
Their rallies underscored the widespread belief that the “Bernanke bubbles” have helped bolster the emerging markets. Fears that the cheap money would dry up have prompted turmoil in recent weeks.        
Still, many Fed watchers believed the policy differences between Ms. Yellen and Mr. Summers were not substantive. Both would be concerned about the sustained levels of high unemployment and likely to tap the brakes on stimulus slowly. In that sense, the market euphoria Monday was surprising to some.        
The United States currency fell marginally against other major currencies, with the euro gaining 0.33 percent against the dollar, to $1.3338, and the dollar falling against its Japanese counterpart to 99.10 yen.        
Analysts at BNP Paribas wrote that there had been a “knee-jerk sell-off” of the dollar on the Summers news, but that it would not last. By far, they said, the most important factor in the currency market was the Fed’s policy announcement on Wednesday.

Bill de Blasio, completing a stunning political turnaround, assumed the role of standard-bearer of New York City’s Democratic Party on Monday, as his last remaining primary rival exited the mayoral race and he turned his attention to a fight against a Republican opponent with a starkly different vision.        


In a coronation of sorts on the steps of City Hall, the state’s Democratic leaders, eager to retake the mayor’s office after almost two decades out of power, feted Mr. de Blasio as a bold new messenger for their party — even as they praised William C. Thompson Jr., the second-place primary finisher who had held out nearly a week before announcing his withdrawal.        
“There is nothing more beautiful than Democratic unity, and thank you for it,” a beaming Mr. de Blasio said, as Mr. Thompson, his face frozen in a smile, stood behind him.        
It was a triumphant moment for Mr. de Blasio, until recently a little-known liberal, who overcame doubts from many Democrats about his candidacy. But he almost immediately faced sharp attacks from the Republican nominee, Joseph J. Lhota, who held his own event on Monday and denounced Mr. de Blasio’s left-leaning platform as extreme.        
Arguing that Mr. de Blasio would “tear down” the city’s progress of the last two decades, Mr. Lhota said New Yorkers would be choosing between two distinct paths in November. Still, mindful of an electorate seeking a new direction after 12 years with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Mr. Lhota was careful to separate himself from the current administration, saying he wanted to bring his own version of change to City Hall.        
“Bill de Blasio’s change is radical,” Mr. Lhota told reporters at a news conference in Central Park just off Fifth Avenue. “My change is practical.”        
As the contours of the general election came into focus, Mr. Thompson, the runner-up in the 2009 race for mayor, was again left reflecting on what went wrong.        
Calling the coming election “bigger than either one of us,” Mr. Thompson offered Mr. de Blasio his endorsement at City Hall. But he was far more animated in criticizing the city’s Board of Elections, saying it was “a disgrace” that no official count had been determined nearly a week after the primary.        
Mr. Thompson, who received 26 percent of the vote to Mr. de Blasio’s 40 percent in the initial, unofficial results, had hoped that as lever voting machine results were double-checked, and tens of thousands of uncounted paper ballots were tallied, Mr. de Blasio’s total might dip below the 40 percent threshold that would prompt an automatic runoff.        
With a completed count still days away, Mr. Thompson, facing strong pressure from Democratic leaders and defections by some of his important endorsers, chose to end his bid.        
“We don’t know how many votes I got, or even how many votes were cast,” said Mr. Thompson, who stood at a lectern emblazoned with a “Bill de Blasio for Mayor” banner.        
Describing himself in a state of political limbo, he said it would be “impossible” for him to mount a fight without knowing whether a runoff would take place.        
“When are they going to finish?” Mr. Thompson said to reporters, referring to the elections board. Without a final count, he added, “it’s such a disadvantage — it just isn’t fair.”        
Mr. Thompson’s remarks were a rare moment of discord at an event meant to showcase Democratic unity and energy ahead of the first mayoral election in years that the party is confident it can win.        
In a sign that party leaders believed it was critical to close ranks around Mr. de Blasio, the rally was presided over by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who made his first appearance at City Hall since being elected governor in 2010.        
“Bill is going to lead this city in the great progressive Democratic traditions that made this the greatest city on the planet,” Mr. Cuomo said, with Mr. de Blasio at his side.

Culture,"










As video game players have gotten older, as antiheroes have become routine across the culture, as sex and violence have permeated prestige television, the controversies that once surrounded the Grand Theft Auto games have begun to seem like sepia-toned oddities from another age. Sure, the new installment, to be released on Tuesday, contains plenty that might offend those who enjoy taking offense, and it is still disturbing to see parents giving these games to preteenage children. Among the interactive pastimes Grand Theft Auto offers — alongside pursuits like yoga, sky diving, tennis, scuba and golf — are bong hits and lap dances.        


But while the franchise has lost the ability to shock, it remains the most immersive spectacle in interactive entertainment. And with the profane and hugely enjoyable Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar Games has produced the best plotted, most playable, character-driven, fictionally coherent entry in this 16-year-old series.        
The game is set in an immense, parodic vision of Southern California, a West Coast counterpoint to the caricature of New York City in Grand Theft Auto IV (2008). While Los Santos — the game’s version of Los Angeles — and its surroundings exist in an alternate reality, it is also a contemporary one that evokes and satirizes the anxieties of 21st-century life. There’s a fake Facebook (LifeInvader), a fake Twitter (Bleeter), a fake Apple (Fruit), a fake Kickstarter (Beseecher), a fake “50 Shades of Grey” (“Chains of Intimacy”), even a fake Call of Duty (Righteous Slaughter 7, a first-person shooter game that advertises itself with the tagline “The identical art of contemporary killing”).        
Grand Theft Auto V is still an action game about hoodlums and thieves; we start with an extended bout of cop killing and proceed to a series of increasingly ambitious heists. But the structure feels more logical than before. Your character doesn’t arrive as an outsider in a new city and start carrying out the requests of people whose only purpose is seemingly to delay him. Instead, the events flow from situations and desires.        
For the first time, there are three controllable characters instead of only one: Franklin, a repo man on the make, loses his job; Michael, a witness-protection retiree, miscalculates after finding his wife cheating on him with her tennis instructor; and Trevor, an oddly lovable psychopathic meth dealer and gun runner, learns that Michael, his onetime partner, faked his death 10 years ago.        
“I’ve got an imbalance,” Michael tells his psychiatrist. “One minute I’m one person, and the next minute I’m another person.”        
A retired — or newly unretired — bank robber, Michael is examining his struggle to control his criminal impulses. He might as well be analyzing the dissonance that afflicted Grand Theft Auto IV. That game’s protagonist, Niko Bellic, would fret in animated sequences about the costs of his life of violence. But under the control of many video game players, Niko would subsequently embark on acts of gleeful, creative murder that belied the story the game wanted to tell about him. Were these two men — the one in the story’s animations and the one manipulated by the player — really the same person?        
With the three-character structure of Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar finds an answer to that riddle.        
“That seamlessness between narrative and interactive is something that we have worked on everywhere,” said Sam Houser, the sometimes reclusive co-founder of Rockstar Games, who agreed to be interviewed after I had spent more than 45 hours inside the game’s world.        
Most video games are about repeated actions, about mastering a skill and exploiting it. Grand Theft Auto games are about variety. There’s the array of content, including radio stations D.J.’d by the likes of Bootsy Collins; entire TV shows with names like “Republican Space Rangers”; and a fake Internet. And there are the missions the characters execute, encompassing car, boat and plane chases; paparazzi ambushes; train robberies; and triathlons. Failure in the new game is less frustrating than in previous iterations, since a generous checkpointing system means that players don’t need to restart a mission from the beginning if they don’t get it right the first time. There’s even an option to skip the action sequences after repeated attempts have gone awry.        
For all that the game does right, it has a genuinely problematic aspect that is not its enthusiasm for violence or sex but its lack of interest in women as something other than lustful airheads (notwithstanding a late-game cameo by Mr. Houser’s mother, Geraldine Moffat, a British actress of the 1960s and ’70s). One of the only young women in the game not oversexed and under-read is sucked into a jet turbine.

Winter squash, already sweet and caramelized from roasting, makes as delicious a partner for miso glaze as eggplant.        


1 large butternut squash (about 2 pounds)        
Salt to taste        
2 tablespoons dark sesame oil        
1 tablespoon mirin        
1 tablespoon sake        
2 tablespoons white or yellow miso        
1 tablespoon sugar        
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet (or 2 if necessary) with parchment. Peel the squash, cut in half and scrape out the seeds and fibers. Slice 1/2 inch thick and place in a large bowl. Season with a little salt if desired and toss with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the sesame oil. Lay the slices in one layer on the baking sheet(s).        
2. Roast the squash for 25 to 30 minutes, turning the slices over every 10 minutes, until the slices are tender all the way through and lightly colored.        
3. Meanwhile, heat the broiler and make the glaze. To make the glaze, combine the mirin and sake in the smallest saucepan you have and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil 20 seconds, taking care not to boil off much of the liquid, then turn the heat to low and stir in the miso and the sugar. Whisk over medium-low heat without letting the mixture boil until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and whisk in the sesame oil.        
4. Remove the squash from the oven and brush each slice with the miso glaze. Place under the broiler, about 2 inches from the heat, and broil for about 1 minutes, or until the glaze begins to bubble and looks shiny. Remove from the heat. Allow to cool if desired or serve hot.        
Yield: Serves 4 to 6        
Advance preparation: This tastes wonderful even a day after you make it. You can serve it cold or reheat.

Most recipes for miso-glazed fish are for salmon, because fatty fish are well suited for this preparation and salmon is particularly delicious. Nobu Matsuhisa is known for his miso-marinated black cod, which he marinates for two to three days. I can’t imagine finding fish fresh enough to marinate for that long, so in my recipe I marinate the fish for a few hours before broiling and then finishing, if necessary, in the oven. The marinade is based on the Matsuhisa recipe, but I’ve reduced the sugar considerably.        


1/4 cup mirin        
1/4 cup sake        
3 tablespoons white or yellow miso paste        
1 tablespoon sugar        
2 teaspoons dark sesame oil        
4 salmon, trout, Arctic char, mahi mahi or black cod fillets, about 6 ounces each        
1. Combine the mirin and sake in the smallest saucepan you have and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil 20 seconds, taking care not to boil off much of the liquid, then turn the heat to low and stir in the miso and the sugar. Whisk over medium heat without letting the mixture boil until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and whisk in the sesame oil. Allow to cool. Transfer to a wide glass or stainless steel bowl or baking dish.        
2. Pat the fish fillets dry and brush or rub on both sides with the marinade, then place them in the baking dish and turn them over a few times in the marinade remaining in the dish. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate for 2 to 3 hours, or for up to a day.        
3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Light the broiler or prepare a grill. Line a sheet pan with foil and oil the foil. Tap each fillet against the sides of the bowl or dish so excess marinade will slide off. Place skin side up on the baking sheet if broiling.        
4. Place the fish skin side down on the grill, or skin side up under the broiler, about 6 inches from the heat. Broil or grill for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until the surface browns and blackens in spots. If necessary (this will depend on the thickness of the fillets) finish in the oven, for about 5 minutes, until the fish is opaque and can be pulled apart easily with a fork.        
Note: For a vegetarian version of this dish, substitute tofu, sliced about 2/3 inch thick, for the fish.        
Yield: Serves 4        
Advance preparation: You can prepare the fish 12 hours before cooking.

Use this nutty, sweet and salty spread as a stand-in for peanut butter, or serve with crudités. I like to pipe it onto rounds of cucumber and slices of jicama.        


1 ounce peanuts (heaped 1/4 cup), roasted        
1 ounce unsalted, unsweetened smooth peanut butter (3 1/2 tablespoons)        
2 tablespoons white or yellow miso        
1 tablespoon honey        
1 tablespoon mirin        
1 teaspoon grated orange zest (optional)        
1. Place the roasted peanuts in a plastic bag or a pastry bag and place on your work surface. Roll over the bag with a rolling pin until the peanuts are crushed.        
2. Combine the crushed peanuts, peanut butter, miso, honey, mirin and orange zest in a bowl and stir together until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.        
Yield: 2/3 cup        
Advance preparation: This will keep for several weeks in the refrigerator but you may want to thin it out a little with water or a little orange juice.

WASHINGTON — President Obama on Monday seized on the fifth anniversary of the 2008 financial collapse to warn that House Republicans would reverse the gains made and willfully cause “economic chaos” with the uncompromising stands they have staked out on looming budget deadlines.        


“Budget battles and debates, those are as old as the republic,” Mr. Obama said before a friendly audience assembled in a White House annex. But, he added, “I cannot remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it can’t get 100 percent of what it wants.”        
A bloc of conservative House Republicans have said that unless Mr. Obama’s signature health insurance law is delayed or repealed, they will not support financing for government operations in the new fiscal year starting Oct. 1 or an essential increase in the nation’s borrowing limit in mid-October.        
Failure to act on federal funding would provoke a government shutdown; even worse, failing to increase the debt limit would leave the government unable to pay bills and creditors and ultimately threaten the nation’s default.        
“The last time the same crew threatened this course of action back in 2011, even the mere suggestion of default slowed our economic growth,” Mr. Obama said, recalling that summer’s market-rattling showdown.        
Mr. Obama’s remarks followed his administration’s release of a report chronicling the actions taken since 2008 to encourage job creation, save the auto industry, revive and regulate banking, and expand education opportunities.        
But he spoke at a time when the economy, as he acknowledged, is still struggling to create enough jobs and his agenda faces opposition mostly from Republicans but also from some Democrats increasingly emboldened against a second-term lame-duck president.        
Still, on the budget fight, most Democrats in Congress support the president, and with his comments he sought to rally them and to set up Republicans for blame should the fiscal fights end badly.        
Mr. Obama noted that in the past Republicans fought for more spending cuts to reduce deficits but that now, with annual deficits declining, they were making their fight over the health care law.        
“The Affordable Care Act has been the law for three and a half years now,” Mr. Obama said. “It passed both houses of Congress. The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional. It was an issue in last year’s election, and the candidate who called for repeal lost. The Republicans in the House have tried to repeal or sabotage it about 40 times. They failed every time. Meanwhile the law has already helped millions of Americans.”        
The president repeated his warning against “self-inflicted wounds” at the event, which was moved from the Rose Garden to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building because of rain. He proceeded with the event even as a shooting unfolded at a naval office building in Southeast Washington.        
Mr. Obama was joined onstage by a group of people that White House officials said included “small-business owners, construction workers, homeowners, consumers and tax cut recipients.”        
The president has struggled for years to balance the desire to claim credit for a slowly improving economy against the need to make sure he acknowledges the pain that many people still feel.        
At the event on Monday, Mr. Obama recalled how close the country, and the world, came to another depression after the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The Lehman bankruptcy caused the credit markets to seize up, the unemployment rate to sour and economic activity to plummet.        
Mr. Obama and his allies have for a long time said that the administration’s actions in early 2009, while extremely unpopular, were critical to holding off a worse collapse. Those include the decision to support President George W. Bush’s bailout of Wall Street, Mr. Obama’s own bailout for the auto industry and the passage of the economic stimulus program.        
But while the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.3 percent — down from a high of 10.1 percent in late 2009 — millions of Americans are still struggling to find a job, and millions more are working at low-wage or part-time jobs and having trouble making ends meet.        
That has been Mr. Obama’s message in the last several months as he has delivered speeches arguing for what he calls a “better bargain for the middle class.” In those speeches, he argues for investments in infrastructure, education, college aid and housing as a way to help middle-class Americans and those trying to get into the middle class.        
The president is scheduled to deliver another one of his “better bargain” speeches in Kansas City, Mo., on Friday when he visits a Ford Motor Company assembly plant.

A United Nations report released on Monday confirmed that a deadly chemical arms attack caused a mass killing in Syria last month and for the first time provided extensive forensic details of the weapons used, which strongly implicated the Syrian government.        


While the report’s authors did not assign blame for the attack on the outskirts of Damascus, the details it documented included the large size and particular shape of the munitions and the precise direction from which two of them had been fired. Taken together, that information appeared to undercut arguments by President Bashar al-Assad of Syria that rebel forces, who are not known to possess such weapons or the training or ability to use them, had been responsible.        
The report, commissioned by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, was the first independent on-the-ground scientific inquest into the attack, which left hundreds of civilians gassed to death, including children, early on Aug. 21.        
The repercussions have elevated the 30-month-old Syrian conflict into a global political crisis that is testing the limits of impunity over the use of chemical weapons. It could also lead to the first concerted action on the war at the United Nations Security Council, which up to now has been paralyzed over Syria policy.        
“The report makes for chilling reading,” Mr. Ban told a news conference after he briefed the Security Council. “The findings are beyond doubt and beyond the pale. This is a war crime.”        
Mr. Ban declined to ascribe blame, saying that responsibility was up to others, but he expressed hope that the attack would become a catalyst for a new diplomatic determination at the United Nations to resolve the Syrian conflict, which has left more than 100,000 people dead and millions displaced.        
There was no immediate reaction to the report from the Syrian government. But just two days before the report was released, Syria officially agreed to join the international convention on banning chemical weapons, and the United States and Russia, which have repeatedly clashed over Syria, agreed on a plan to identify and purge those weapons from the country by the middle of next year. Syria has said it would abide by that plan.        
The main point of the report was to establish whether chemical weapons had been used in the Aug. 21 attack in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, an area long infiltrated by rebels. The United Nations inspectors concluded that “chemical weapons have been used in the ongoing conflict between the parties in the Syrian Arab Republic, also against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale.”        
The weapons inspectors, who visited Ghouta and left the country with large amounts of evidence on Aug. 31, said, “In particular, the environmental, chemical and medical samples we have collected provide clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used.”        
But the report’s annexes, detailing what the authors found, were what caught the attention of nonproliferation experts.        
In two chilling pieces of information, the inspectors said that the remnants of a warhead they had found showed its capacity of sarin to be about 56 liters — far higher than initially thought. They also said that falling temperatures at the time of the attack ensured that the poison gas, heavier than air, would hug the ground, penetrating lower levels of buildings “where many people were seeking shelter.”        
The investigators were unable to examine all of the munitions used, but they were able to find and measure several rockets or their components. Using standard field techniques for ordnance identification and crater analysis, they established that at least two types of rockets had been used, including an M14 artillery rocket bearing Cyrillic markings and a 330-millimeter rocket of unidentified provenance.        
These findings, though not presented as evidence of responsibility, were likely to strengthen the argument of those who claim that the Syrian government bears the blame, because the weapons in question had not been previously documented or reported to be in possession of the insurgency.

For three years, Shalom Yoran survived the German occupation of Poland even as he saw his fellow Jews slaughtered by the Nazis. When he and his family inevitably became targets themselves, his mother knew she would not escape.        


“Go, my beloved children,” she told Mr. Yoran and his brother, Musio, as they fled into a field to escape German gunfire. “Try to save yourselves and take vengeance for us.”        
That was in September 1942. The brothers disappeared into the woods and went on to spend the rest of World War II fighting the elements, injury, illness and the Nazis.        
After enduring the winter in an underground shelter that they had built, they shifted from trying to survive to striking back. They became Jewish partisans, joining many others in fighting an insurgent war against the occupying Germans in Poland and elsewhere.        
By the spring of 1943, they had conducted their first mission: burning a factory that made rifle butts for German weapons. Mr. Yoran began to feel that he was fulfilling his mother’s wish.        
“For me, this was the turning point in the war,” he wrote in a 1996 memoir, “The Defiant: A True Story of Jewish Vengeance and Survival.” 
He continued: “Instead of constantly being on the run, or hiding underground trying to survive, I had actually participated in an attack on the German war machine. This was the beginning of my revenge.”        
Mr. Yoran, who died on Sept. 9 in Manhattan at 88, was 14 when German forces invaded his hometown, Raciaz, and 17 the last time he saw his parents. His mother, Hannah, and his father, Shmuel, were killed within days of his escape into the woods with his brother, who was four years older. The Nazis eventually killed 1,040 Jews in Raciaz, virtually its entire Jewish population.        
Mr. Yoran and his brother became full-time fighters, killing German soldiers on patrols or at their camps, planting mines, destroying roads and bridges — all while scrounging and stealing food and clothing. They soon made their way through northeast Poland, to the forests near Lake Naroch in what is now Belarus, to join a group of Jewish partisans who were coordinating their missions with Soviet forces.        
Yet even there, fighting alongside non-Jewish Russians and Poles, they encountered anti-Semitism.        
“So here we were, fighting against a common enemy — the Germans, whose aim it was to totally annihilate the Jewish people and to take over the Soviet Union — side by side with fellow fighters whose own hatred of Jews was notorious,” Mr. Yoran wrote.        
“In this demoralizing situation I told myself again and again that I was fighting as a Jew — with them, but not as one of them. I dreamed of having my own country, of fighting for it, and even dying for it. That was what kept up my morale.”        
He and his brother joined the Polish Army, advancing into Germany in 1945 as Allied forces closed in on Berlin.        
Mr. Yoran was born Selim Sznycer on June 29, 1925, in Warsaw, the son of a lumberyard owner. He had only limited schooling before his family fled the Nazis.        
After the war he worked for a group that helped smuggle Jewish refugees into British-controlled Palestine, resisting British efforts to prevent them from entering.        
He assumed many identities on his own journey there, including that of a British soldier. Finally, to convince the authorities that he was not a refugee but a lifelong resident of Palestine, he assumed the name of a dead cousin, Shalom Yoran, in 1946.        
“When I finally became a ‘legal’ citizen of Palestine,” Mr. Yoran wrote, “I bore my mother’s maiden name and my cousin’s date of birth.”        
With the founding of Israel, and after receiving his high school equivalency diploma, Mr. Yoran joined the Israeli Air Force, learning aircraft maintenance. While in the Air Force he met Varda Granevsky. They married in 1954.        
He later became an executive with Israel Aircraft Industries, which helped supply the Israeli government. It is now called Israel Aerospace Industries. He moved to the United States in the late 1970s to run an American office of an aircraft trading and manufacturing company.        
It was after he had arrived in Palestine that Mr. Yoran began writing about his life, recording his memories in notebooks and on loose sheafs of paper while recovering from abdominal surgery in a hospital.        
Decades later, while he and his wife were clearing out their apartment near Tel Aviv, he found the papers in a suitcase. The couple spent years translating the notes from Polish into English, often first into Hebrew. The fruit of their work was “The Defiant.”        
Mr. Yoran died after a long illness, said his wife, a sculptor. He is also survived by two daughters, Dafna and Yaelle, and two grandsons.        
His brother, who became known as Maurice Sznycer, moved to Paris after the war and became a professor of antiquities and West Semitic languages at the Sorbonne. He died in 2010.        
Mr. Yoran helped found the Museum of Jewish Heritage in Manhattan. Near the end of his life, when he had dementia and other illnesses, his family established the Rose Art Foundation, which donates mobile reclining chairs to patients in need.        
After “The Defiant” was published, Mr. Yoran frequently spoke publicly about his experience as a partisan.        
“If there is a lesson to be gleaned, it is that no person should succumb to brutality without putting up a resistance,” he wrote in his book. “Individually it can save one’s life; en masse it can change the course of history.”

The question was about the future, and Carmelo Anthony responded with four words of practiced reassurance.        


“I’m not going nowhere,” he told Bloomberg Television last week in an attempt to soothe the nerves of antsy Knicks fans.        
Strained syntax aside, it was the sensible thing to say, perhaps the only thing to say. It might even be true, although predicting the whims of an N.B.A. superstar is always a dicey proposition.        
Ten months from now, Anthony will probably opt out of his Knicks contract, sign a five-year deal for $129 million and happily resume his role as the basketball prince of Broadway. Anthony loves New York, and New York loves Anthony, playoff failures notwithstanding.        
He has every reason to stay: the money, the market, the chance to be the savior who ends the Knicks’ 40-year championship drought. It was only two and a half years ago that Anthony forced the Denver Nuggets to send him here. It seems unlikely he would leave so soon.        
But a lot can change in 10 months, and the specter of Anthony’s free agency will shadow the Knicks all season, just as the threat of his departure loomed over the Nuggets three years ago.        
The circumstances are different, of course. Anthony fled Denver for reasons beyond basketball. His wife, LaLa, an actress, wanted the Broadway spotlight. Carmelo wanted the Madison Avenue connections.        
As Anthony mentioned in that same interview last week: “Out there in Denver, from a business standpoint, I didn’t have all of the outlets that I have right now in New York. I wasn’t able to take advantage of all the opportunities and all the people that I know here in New York.”        
Those are powerful forces, and Anthony may stay based on those considerations alone. But when the fashion shows are over, and all the shoes have been sold, there will still be basketball to be played. That is where the uncertainty lies.        
The Knicks are 7-14 in the playoffs since Anthony arrived, with two first-round exits. They won 54 games last season — their best record in decades — but they hit that mark in a down year for the Eastern Conference and still failed to reach the conference finals. The Knicks may have already peaked. Their chief rivals have only grown stronger.        
The Indiana Pacers, who ousted the Knicks in the semifinals, have since added Luis Scola and will welcome back a healthy Danny Granger. The Chicago Bulls will have Derrick Rose back. The Nets have added Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Andrei Kirilenko. The Miami Heat still have LeBron James.        
The Knicks improved marginally, adding Metta World Peace, Beno Udrih and Andrea Bargnani, while losing Jason Kidd, Chris Copeland and Steve Novak. But Kidd’s departure and the retirements of Kurt Thomas and Rasheed Wallace leave a huge leadership gap in a locker room desperate for cool heads and wise words.        
It was Kidd who coaxed J. R. Smith and Anthony into a smarter, team-oriented game last season, and it was Kidd who helped keep the combustible Smith on course. The Knicks might have the highest volatility index in the league, with World Peace, Smith and Kenyon Martin.        
The roster is deep but awkwardly assembled. Amar’e Stoudemire is a poor fit between Anthony and Tyson Chandler, but he might be even worse on a second unit with Bargnani, another scoring-minded, defensively challenged big man. The glut of power forwards might push Anthony back to small forward, robbing the Knicks of the explosive small lineup that proved so effective last season.        
The Knicks are still missing a true co-star for Anthony. Their second-best scorer is the flighty Smith, who will open this season with a five-game drug suspension.        
How patient will Anthony be? He turns 30 in May. His next contract is likely to be his last as an elite player. If a championship is his goal, he has to wonder whether the Knicks have the vision and the flexibility to surround him with the right players.        
As it stands, the Knicks appear no closer to championship contention today than they were a year ago.        
The franchise will have a chance to reboot in 2015, when the contracts of Chandler, Stoudemire and Bargnani expire, creating enough salary-cap room to sign another star or two. But that opportunity is two years away, and Anthony has not shown an appetite for rebuilding. He has cited the Nuggets’ planned overhaul in 2011 as the reason for his trade demand.        
Anthony will be eligible for an extension Feb. 22, and he could remove any doubt about his intentions by signing then. But he stands to make much more by opting out in July, and he will almost certainly wait.        
In the meantime, what if the Knicks crash and burn? What if Stoudemire’s knees give out again? What if Smith fails another drug test? What if, as many commentators expect, the Knicks fall a few notches and cede the spotlight to the rival Nets? What if they lose in the first round next spring? How secure will Anthony feel about his future then?        
New York is still New York. But there is another city that can offer heady doses of fame, fortune and brand promotion, and it happens to be home to the N.B.A.’s most glamorous franchise. The Los Angeles Lakers will have millions in salary-cap room next summer, and a powerful recruiter in Kobe Bryant, one of Anthony’s closest friends. Per N.B.A. rules, the Lakers could offer Anthony only $96 million over four years. But they can offer something the Knicks cannot: a tradition of success, a knack for acquiring and building around superstars, and a habit of staging parades in June.        
Maybe Anthony isn’t going anywhere, as he asserted last week. But verbal commitments and loyalty are malleable concepts in professional sports. Nothing means anything until the contract is signed.

BERLIN — This week, Transatlantic Trends publishes the annual public opinion survey conducted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States.        


The trends are always fascinating because they give a sense of public opinion attitudes on both sides of the Atlantic and how wide, or narrow, those differences are over certain foreign policy issues.        
This year, the survey focused mostly on the war in Syria and other issues concerning the Middle East. According to a preview of the data, it is clear that in Europe, the public is highly skeptical of any military intervention in Syria. On average, 70 percent of those asked in 10 European countries and Turkey opposed intervention.        
“The trends show that European publics do not trust the use of force,” said Ian Lesser, director of the German Marshall Fund’s Brussels office. “This has serious implications for European foreign, defense and security policy,” he added.        
Europe’s ambitions to develop a coherent foreign and security policy recently took a battering when the leaders of the European Union’s two most important military powers, Britain and France, failed to win public support for a military strike against Syria.        
David Cameron, the British prime minister, suffered a humiliating defeat by lawmakers during a vote on British participation in a possible airstrike led by the United States against Syria.        
Conservative lawmakers said the vote showed not only that Mr. Cameron was unable to control his own backbenchers but also that he had underestimated the increasing tendency toward isolationism, including anti-Americanism, in his own political camp.        
The British public reacted to the vote with enormous relief. In a country that lost hundreds of troops in Afghanistan, every public opinion poll has shown that Britain is not prepared to back the United States with troops again — especially as the Obama administration seemed prepared to bypass the United Nations Security Council.        
François Hollande, the French president, has remained committed to the possibility of military action, even as the United States and Russia negotiated how to persuade Syria to relinquish its chemical arsenal. When Mr. Hollande intervened in Mali this year, he had wide public support. But Syria is a different matter. The Transatlantic Trends report shows that 65 percent of those polled in France oppose any intervention.        
“It is becoming much more difficult to get public support for the use of force,” said Henrik Heidenkamp, security expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London.        
In the foreseeable future, no British leader will dare commit the country to using force before taking public opinion into account. Analysts wonder whether Mr. Hollande would indeed take the risk in intervening in Syria without public support. Bypassing the public could turn into too much of a political risk.        
What seems to be happening is that voters across Europe are beginning to resemble the Germans in their attitudes toward the military. They are becoming more cautious, inward looking and reluctant to use force. This is heightened by a sharp sense of disappointment with President Obama’s foreign policy, as the Transatlantic Trends report suggests.        
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who is seeking re-election for a third term on Sunday, at no time allowed herself to be drawn into any debate about the use of force. She knows full well that German public opinion is strongly against any military action. Even the chemical weapons attacks did not seem to shock Germans all that much — despite their abhorrence over how the Nazis used such deadly weapons during World War II.        
Not only did the Europeans not back any military effort, they did not seem all that engaged in the diplomatic efforts, either. With few exceptions, there was no push by European Union member states or Catherine Ashton, the union’s foreign policy chief, to pursue the diplomatic channel or to propose that Syria’s chemical weapons stockpile be brought under international inspection.        
“Europe was not pursuing all the diplomatic and political options,” said Marcin Terlikowski, security expert at the Polish Institute of International Affairs.        
In the end, it was President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, harshly criticized by the United States for supporting the Syrian president, who took center stage by proposing international supervision of the chemical weapons.        
These trends may be pointing to a “new” Europe in which the political resolve for serious diplomacy is lacking among the European Union’s 28 member states, and the conviction to enforce international weapons conventions is largely absent.        
These trends are not comforting to the Obama administration. Over the past several years, U.S. defense secretaries have repeatedly criticized their European allies for being unwilling to spend more on defense, share scarce military resources or make tough decisions about the use of force.        
Yet, if Europe as a whole is becoming more skeptical of the military, the latest Transatlantic Trends report shows that the American public also increasingly opposes the use of force, at least when it comes to Syria.        
According to the survey, 62 percent of Americans polled oppose military intervention, compared to 55 percent a year ago. Given this war weariness, it is hardly surprising that Mr. Obama postponed seeking a vote from Congress.        
This aversion to force, say analysts, may reflect a growing realization that military force carries a very high price, though it often yields only limited results. Force can overthrow dictators, as in the case of Iraq and Libya, or the Taliban in Afghanistan. But the instability now in all three countries has, as the Transatlantic Trends report shows, encouraged skepticism among Europeans and Americans about the use of force.        
If Europeans refuse to consider force as a last option to support diplomatic efforts, analysts believe that the European Union’s foreign policy will be toothless.

Federal health officials reported Monday that at least two million Americans fall ill from antibiotic-resistant bacteria every year and that at least 23,000 die from those infections, putting a hard number on a growing public health threat. It was the first time that federal authorities quantified the effects of organisms that many antibiotics are powerless to fight.         
The number of deaths is substantially lower than previous estimates, in part because researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stripped out cases in which a drug-resistant infection was present but not necessarily the cause of death. Infectious disease doctors have long warned that antibiotic resistance — in which bacteria develop defenses against antibiotics used to kill them — threatens to return society to a time when people died from ordinary infections.        
“They have come up with hard numbers where it has been only guesswork,” said Dr. Stuart B. Levy, a professor of microbiology at Tufts University and the president of the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics. “This sets a baseline we can all believe in.”        
In 2007, the C.D.C. estimated that about 100,000 people died every year of infections they developed while in hospitals. Most of those infections were believed to be resistant to some antibiotics, but not necessarily the most widely used ones. And it was unclear how many of the deaths were caused by the drug-resistant infections. Monday’s report quantifies that.        
Dr. Steven L. Solomon, the director of the C.D.C.’s office of antimicrobial resistance, acknowledged that the report underestimated the numbers, but said that was by design. Researchers were instructed to be conservative and to base their calculations only on deaths that were a direct result of a drug-resistant bacterial infection.        
“This is a floor,” Dr. Solomon said. “We wanted the cleanest number, the least subjective number.”        
One point of contention has been the extent to which industrial-scale animal farming contributes to the problem of antibiotic-resistant infections in humans. The government has estimated that more than 70 percent of antibiotics in the United States are given to animals. Companies use them to prevent sickness when animals are packed together in ways that breed infection. They also use them to make animals grow faster, though federal authorities are trying to stop that.        
The report said that “much of antibiotic use in animals is unnecessary and inappropriate and makes everyone less safe.” It also said that about half of antibiotic use in people is inappropriate.        
The 114-page report counts infections from 17 drug-resistant bacteria and one fungus, pathogens that Dr. Solomon said caused an overwhelming majority of drug-resistant bacterial infections in the country. It drew on data from five disease-tracking systems, including a major count of bacterial infections reported in hospitals in 10 different areas across the country. The count of deaths was based on mathematical models — one for each resistant organism.        
One particularly lethal type of drug-resistant bacteria, known as CRE, has become resistant to nearly all antibiotics on the market. It is still relatively rare, causing just 600 deaths a year, but researchers have identified it in health care facilities in 44 states.        
“We are getting closer and closer to the cliff,” said Dr. Michael Bell, a C.D.C. official who presented the data.        
Infections from one of the most pervasive types of drug-resistant bacteria tracked in the report, MRSA, have been declining. Invasive MRSA infections in hospitals went down by more than half from 2005 to 2011, according to a paper published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. However, the number of invasive MRSA infections picked up outside health care settings has not changed much, and researchers pointed out that the number of those types of infections has for the first time outstripped the number acquired in hospitals.        
“This is a really big switch,” said Eli Perencevich, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Iowa.        
Hospitals have taken steps to prevent drug-resistant infections, but less is known about preventing infections outside hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. There has been little research, for example, on the extent to which antibiotic use on industrial farms contributes to resistant germs in people. The farm animal industry has been reluctant to allow data collection, and very few studies of the link have been done.        
In a separate study in JAMA Internal Medicine on Monday, researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health sifted through health records of more than 440,000 people in the Geisinger Health System, which operates a network of clinics and hospitals in Pennsylvania, and found that patients who lived near farms and areas where manure was dumped were 38 percent more likely to develop a MRSA infection, particularly of soft tissue or skin, researchers found.        
Some researchers not involved in the study said it offered evidence that living near farms increased one’s chances of developing a MRSA infection. But the study did not test farm animals or soil for MRSA, nor did it find evidence of the type of MRSA that is typically associated with farm animals, and others said the infections might have been caused by something other than antibiotics on farms.

Two years after Chipotle Mexican Grill introduced to widespread acclaim an animated commercial with a pointed message about sustainable farming, the company is back with another animated spot on the subject of food production.        


The new commercial, called “The Scarecrow,” has already amassed more than four million views on YouTube since it was uploaded last week. The commercial takes swipes at giant companies that treat food like another product to process and contrasts that with food made in sustainable ways that is fresh and wholesome.

AMC wants more “Dead” and who could be surprised?         
“The Walking Dead,” the top show in television among the advertiser-preferred group of viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 is going to get what AMC is calling a “companion series,” with an expected airdate sometime in 2015.        
The network announced on Monday that Robert Kirkman, who wrote the comic book series that inspired the television show, will develop the new version, which is still untitled. It will, fans will be happy to note, feature zombies.        
In a statement, Mr. Kirkman said, “The opportunity to make a show that isn’t tethered by the events of the comic book, and is truly a blank page, has set my creativity racing.”        
Other members of the “Walking Dead” creative team, including the producers Gale Anne Hurd and David Alpert, will be involved in the new effort as well.        
It was the second time this month that AMC announced new shows developed from the roots of its current hits. Last week, the network announced that it had ordered “Better Call Saul,” a spinoff of “Breaking Bad.”

For more than four decades, the Man Booker Prize for Fiction has been a uniquely British award, seeking to identify the best novel by authors from Ireland and the Commonwealth.        
Now that distinction may end. The prize committee will break with tradition and allow American authors to be eligible, beginning next year, The Sunday Times in London reported. It will include Americans because the Booker committee “believes U.S. writers must be allowed to compete to ensure the award’s global reputation,” The Times said.        
Amy Barder, a spokeswoman for organization, said in an e-mail that the committee planned to announce changes to the rules of the prize on Wednesday, but declined to confirm The Times’s report. “The information which is currently in circulation is incomplete,” Ms. Barder said.        
The winner of this year’s Booker will be announced at a ceremony in London on Oct. 15.

Robert M. Gates, the former defense secretary under President George W. Bush and President Obama, will tell the story of his tenure in those administrations in a new memoir, his publisher said on Monday.        
“Duty,” to be released by Knopf, chronicles Mr. Gates’s nearly five years managing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and his “political war with Congress” every day he was in office, Mr. Gates said in a statement.        
The book is also about “the dramatic contrast between my public respect, bipartisanship and calm, and my private frustration, disgust and anger,” said Mr. Gates, who left the Obama administration in 2011.        
Knopf said it would release the book in January 2014.

After several years tracking orangutans in the Sumatran swamplands, researchers made some surprising discoveries, they report in the journal PLoS One: males make travel plans up to 24 hours in advance and share them with nearby orangutans by emitting long, loud calls that can be heard more than a half-mile away.        


Their cheek pads act as a funnel, amplifying their calls like a megaphone.        
“Males emitted long calls mostly facing the direction they traveled a few hours later, or even after a night’s rest,” said one of the researchers, Karin Isler of the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich. Hearing a call, interested females might come closer to stay in contact, while nondominant males might flee to avoid a confrontation. The orangutans usually traveled about a half-mile a day, often looking for fruit from trees.        
There are numerous examples of planning in animal species. A zoo chimpanzee, for example, was observed gathering stones and chunks of concrete before the zoo opened, for later use as ammunition against visitors. In experiments, bonobos and chimpanzees were also found to select and store tools to use in the future. Western scrub jays and Eurasian jays are also known to plan in advance.        
Dr. Isler said the new study drove home the point “that we should not underestimate these magnificent creatures, and also other animals.”

I lay on my back with my teeth clenched and my hands gripping the sides of a hospital bed. A crowd of strangers in white coats filled the tiny room. Waves of pain lapped from my abdomen into my chest as the venom worked its way toward my heart.        


An experimental antivenin drug was about to be injected into my bloodstream, and while I waited for the needle to go in, I reflected that if anyone in the world was the right person to be bitten by a black widow spider, I was that guy.        
As a professional outdoorsman, I spend a lot of time around things that can bite, claw, stab or otherwise attack me. I have been lucky with snakes and reckless with bears. I have had some close calls with lionfish. It figures that the thing to finally nail me would be living on my own front porch.        
The black widow’s graceful form and red hourglass marking have made it America’s most recognizable spider. The Eastern species, Latrodectus mactans, is common from Florida to New York and as far west as Texas.        
But despite their fearsome reputation, black widows are surprisingly shy and retiring. Over the course of your life, you have probably walked past hundreds of black widows without even realizing it. Each one packs enough venom to lay out a heavyweight boxer for days, yet globally only a few people each year are killed by widow bites.        
Widow webs are easy to identify, messy and close to the ground. I spotted the first one knitted against the steps of my front porch, in Albemarle County, Va. A little black ballerina was balanced in the back of it. I regretted killing her, but she was too close to an area where my children play. I blasted her with wasp spray, and she dropped out of her web.        
I hunted for more to photograph and eliminate. The perimeter of my house turned out to harbor a village of black widow webs. I racked up as many as a dozen little black-and-red trophies a day. Fascinated by our proximity, I sought to learn more about these deadly neighbors.        
The black widow is unfairly named. Female spiders rarely kill the male after mating, and possibly only in captivity. The male looks very different from the mature female; he is smaller and brownish. (The hourglass marking is quite variable in both sexes.) Both sexes carry the same venom, but the females have more of it and their fangs can inject it deeper.        
One winter day, I carried inside a basket my children had left on the front lawn. I noticed a withered-looking black widow clinging to its side, still alive but stiff and slow with the cold. I dropped her into a Mason jar, and for three months, she lived on my desk on a diet of moths.        
I learned a lot about black widows just by observing her. They are awkward outside their webs. They are poor climbers compared with other spiders, unable to scale the side of a jar. I was surprised that my pet widow never used her venom first. When confronted by prey that was too large or aggressive, she backed off rather than bite.        
One warm spring afternoon, I decided to go fishing for dinner. On the same front porch where I had removed so many black widows, I kept a pair of water shoes and some fishing tackle. I put the shoes and the tackle in my car and drove eight miles to my favored hole.        
I donned the shoes before walking to the edge of the water. Within about a dozen steps, I felt a stinging sensation on the second toe of my left foot, as if there had been a thorn inside the shoe. Then the pain increased to about that of a wasp’s sting. I sat on a rock and removed the shoe. The squashed remains of a spider were smeared across the insole. I realized instantly what must have happened: a black widow from the porch had made its home in my shoe.        
For a long moment, I stared at my throbbing toe and wondered what to do.        
Some people are more affected by the venom than others. Most healthy adults experience a lot of pain and recover on their own. But others become incapacitated, and some die. Which group would I fall into? Or had I been bitten by something else entirely? Why make a big deal out of nothing?        
I decided to wait and find out before getting behind the wheel. I dipped my foot into the cool water and decided I might as well pass the time by fishing.

Business,"










A friend of mine never understood why his neighbors spent a lot of money on things he didn’t care about, like houses and cars. To him, these things weren’t worth the money. So one time when he was being particularly grumpy about it, I asked him about his family’s spending habits.        


I had noticed that compared with most families I knew, his family appeared to spend a lot of money on vacations and even more on recreational gear. My friend, being a smart guy, took only a moment to see the disconnect. Both my friend and his neighbors had made a decision that it was worth it to them to spend more on things and experiences that they really valued.        
It’s not unusual to spend more money on the things that really matter to us. We probably all have something we refuse to substitute for a cheaper option. However, when we do spend more without building a framework for making these decisions, it’s the kind of behavior that can blow up budgets and lead us to spend more on things that aren’t worth the extra money.        
Here are a few things to keep in mind.        
1. It makes sense to spend more if we want something to last longer. 
A few years ago, I had my eye on a new road bike. The bike I wanted wasn’t cheap, and I debated buying a less expensive option. But when I started weighing the purchase in terms of wanting to ride the bike for years, the more expensive, better-built bike made more sense. I still have and love the bike.        
Time matters when we’re debating spending more. When we anticipate using something over a longer period of time, it’s important to compare the cost of replacing a cheaper version two or three times. If the cost is comparable, the more expensive option could be the better choice.        
2. It makes sense to spend more if we want rare, specific experiences. 
I imagine more than a few of you rolled your eyes when I shared my love of expensive ice cream. Part of the reason I enjoy it so much is the anticipation. I don’t eat it often, only once every few weeks. However, the pleasure I get from anticipating that next pint is almost worth the price alone. I wouldn’t feel the same way if it wasn’t a rare experience.        
So when you want to spend more on something specific, remember to consider the value of anticipation and how often you plan on doing it. The rarer the event, the greater the anticipation, and research shows that anticipating a future event (like a vacation) can match or even beat the happiness of the event itself. It’s the rare two-for-one deal that makes it worth spending more if we’ve made the smart decision to save and plan for it.        
3. It doesn’t make sense to spend more if it’s not a priority. 
Sometimes the generic is just as good as the brand. Unlike my ice cream, I rarely opt for the most expensive laundry soap. Now, some of you may be really particular about your laundry soap. The point is when we spend more, we need to consider both reasons 1 and 2 and if it’s a purchase that actually matters to us.        
If the options are interchangeable, then go for a less expensive choice. Don’t get in the habit of spending more for the sake of spending more.        
4. It doesn’t make sense to spend more if it’s about competing with people. 
My friend didn’t care about his neighbors’ cars and houses. For him, spending more on vacations and gear he really wanted was what mattered. So don’t forget the phrase “keeping up with the Joneses” when deciding what something is really worth.        
Commit to spending more only on the things and experiences that matter personally. It doesn’t matter what our neighbors or friends want. Focus on what matters to you and your family and ignore what everyone else is doing.        
Spending a lot of money on something — even something we’d consider a luxury — doesn’t mean we’re making a bad money decision. It may even be the best decision. But to reach the point of knowing it’s a good decision, we need to be really aware of why we want to spend more and do our best to align the decision with our values.        
The more we can make money decisions that support our values, the less likely we are to regret those decisions, even if they’re expensive choices. Keep that thought in mind the next time you wonder if it’s really worth it to spend more. Brace yourself: sometimes the answer will be yes.

MADRID — Spain is on track to meet the 2013 budget deficit target it agreed on with its European Union partners and should emerge from recession before the end of the year, the economy minister said on Monday.        


The minister, Luis de Guindos, also said the government would not require additional one-time austerity measures as part of the 2014 budget that it will present this month. The budget will be based on an improved forecast for 2014, both in terms of overall growth and unemployment, which hit a record 27 percent earlier this year, Mr. de Guindos said.        
After the financial crisis burst Spain’s construction bubble in 2008, “no doubt 2014 will be the first year when Spain will have some recovery,” the minister said.        
Given the depth of Spain’s recession, the European Commission agreed in May to give Madrid more time to reach its budgetary targets. Mr. de Guindos said he expected Spain’s deficit to fall to the new target of 6.5 percent of gross domestic product — rather than the initial target of 4.5 percent — from 7 percent last year.        
While Spain negotiated a banking bailout worth up to 100 billion euros ($133 billion), it ended up requesting only 41 billion euros to keep afloat institutions accounting for about 30 percent of its banking sector, including Bankia, a giant lender that Madrid nationalized in May 2012.        
At the time of Bankia’s near collapse, the center-right government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy initially resisted any outside intervention in the banking sector. In hindsight, however, Mr. de Guindos described the bailout on Monday as “a model of what should happen” when a financial sector finds itself in such a precarious situation. “The bailout of the Spanish banks prevented a bailout of the whole of Spain,” he said.        
Although officials from the International Monetary Fund and other creditors started another review of Spain’s banking progress on Monday, Mr. de Guindos suggested that “Spanish banks don’t have an important capital need,” implying that Spain would not require an extension of its bank bailout.        
For banks that sought to raise capital, he added, “the capacity to access the markets is completely different to a year ago.” Last week, Banco Sabadell announced that it was raising up to 1.4 billion euros to bolster its balance sheet and meet regulatory demands.        
Furthermore, the interest rate premium demanded by investors for buying Spanish bonds compared with Germany’s benchmark bonds fell this month below the comparable premium on Italian bonds for the first time since March of last year.        
The Madrid government has forecast that Spain’s economy will grow 0.5 percent in 2014 after contracting by 1.3 percent this year. Mr. de Guindos would not say what the improved 2014 forecast would be. And while unemployment is expected to continue falling, he warned that Spain still faced significant challenges in terms of creating jobs and reviving consumer spending.        
“We believe the economy of Spain is leaving behind the recession, but not by any means the crisis,” he said.        
Mr. de Guindos was speaking after hundreds of thousands of pro-secession citizens of the northeastern region of Catalonia demanded last week that Catalonia be allowed to hold a referendum on independence. From the economic perspective, Mr. de Guindos said Monday that “a secessionist plan by a Spanish region is a lose-lose situation” for the region and for the country.

LONDON — No designers have embraced the digital age more fervently than the British. But there are signs that some are backing off from the digital prints that have been a motif for the last few seasons.        


Not so at Mary Katrantzou, who seemed engulfed by her own brilliance with computerized patterns. The theme was shoes, a suitably fetishistic subject for any fashionista. But this footwear — starting with hefty men’s brogues — undulated across the body as photo prints of sneakers, laces and all, were printed on big jackets. Shiny toes on the breast of bustier dresses and shoe laces from hip to thigh? Really?        
The second half of the show, when the designer turned for inspiration to that most fluffy of females, Marie Antoinette, was much easier to understand: full-skirted, decorative dresses more familiar in Ms. Katrantzou’s work, with the patterns of royal court slippers.        
Ms. Katrantzou has been wonderfully inventive as a digital print leader, but maybe for one season, she should turn her computer off.        
That is just what Matthew Williamson seemed to have done in his collection, where his digital print elements were entirely replaced by artistic prints inspired by nature. They included a recurring dragonfly theme and botanical references that gave a sweet serenity to summer clothes.        
But then WOW! The colors were vivid, starting with a palette of orange and pink, phasing into yellow and clotted cream, then moving to sky blue. But any time the color faded, decoration took over, with appliqués and embroideries of flowers, making this collection as sophisticated as it was well thought out.        
Shoes seem to be all the rage as a theme. The Vivienne Westwood Red Label collection opened with the model Lily Cole doing a dance of death in a flurry of red dust on the runway. She was interpreting Hans Christian Andersen’s story of “The Red Shoes,” which was linked in Ms. Westwood’s mind with the wearing out of planet earth and global warming.        
The designer is adamant about supporting the cause. But her cri de coeur about climate change came with some stylish draped dresses, twisted jackets on streamlined pantsuits and clothes that were both wearable and pretty.

PARIS — Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund whose career has been buffeted by a series of sexual scandals, is reinventing himself again, this time as an economic adviser to the Serbian government.        


Serbian officials said Monday that Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s appointment would be announced on Tuesday in Belgrade, the capital. Aleksandar Vucic, the first deputy prime minister, said by telephone from Belgrade that Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s duties would include helping to restructure the country’s large foreign debt and to attract foreign investment, and managing relations with the International Monetary Fund.        
He said Mr. Strauss-Kahn had agreed to work pro bono for the first three months.        
Mr. Strauss-Kahn, 64, an economist, could not be reached for comment on Monday. In late July, he said in an interview broadcast on the Russian state news channel Rossiya 24 that his political career was behind him and that he was working as an adviser for large companies in Russia, Africa and Latin America, among other places. “Politics for me is in the past,” he said.        
Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a onetime presidential contender in France, resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund in 2011 after he was accused of sexually assaulting a housekeeper at a hotel in New York. The charges were later dropped.        
In France, he still faces charges of involvement in a prostitution ring in the northern French city of Lille. His lawyers have denied any wrongdoing, saying that while Mr. Strauss-Kahn had been present at “libertine” gatherings, he was not aware that the women were being paid.        
Serbia recently received approval to start negotiations to enter the European Union and has been seeking to rehabilitate its international image in the aftermath of the bloody Balkan wars of the 1990s. That has prompted some Serbian analysts to question why a country in need of rebranding has hired a disgraced figure who himself would seem to be seeking international rehabilitation.        
Vesna Pesic, a sociologist in Belgrade, said Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s recent scandals made him an odd pick. “We have very good economists here, and I personally would not have chosen him because of the accusations against him,” she said. “It is propaganda and marketing. But people here are so exhausted by the recession, and they don’t care.”        
Mr. Vucic, the first deputy prime minister, defended the choice, saying that Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s recent history had no bearing on his financial expertise. He said that questioning Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s economic acumen in light of the recent scandals would be like questioning Pablo Picasso’s powers as an artist because of his treatment of women.        
“Pablo Picasso had lots of problems with his wives and kids, but he was still a genius,” he said. “We think Mr. Strauss-Kahn is a great economist, and we think he might help us with his knowledge and experience. We need to revive our economy. We don’t speak of moral competences. He is not going to be the minister of culture.”        
Srdjan Bogosavljevic, the director of the Belgrade offices of Ipsos, a polling firm, said Monday that public opinion in Serbia was divided over the wisdom of hiring a foreigner to help revive the struggling economy. But he said that someone of Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s experience could be an asset to Serbia’s 29-year-old finance minister, Lazar Krstic, a largely untested Yale graduate who left the global consultancy firm McKinsey to join the Serbian government this month.        
Mr. Krstic faces the daunting tasks of taming Serbia’s ballooning budget deficit and public debt, and renegotiating a loan agreement with the I.M.F.        
Mr. Strauss-Kahn has been seeking to return to public life in recent months. In July, he was named to the board of a banking subsidiary of Rosneft, the Russian state oil company. He also appeared on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival in May.        
But his attempted comeback has not been without incident. Last year, a Paris theatrical production called “Suite 2806” reimagined the encounter in the New York hotel that wrecked Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s presidential prospects. Earlier this year, a roman à clef by a former lover described him in an unflattering light.

“Who plants flowers on this crummy street?” protested Carlos, the hero of a young adult novel called “The Street of the Flower Boxes,” which told of the rejuvenation of a trash-strewed, gang-infested block in Manhattan of the 1960s: West 94th Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue.        


Carlos was fiction, but the events in the book were based on the real-life experience of its author, Peggy Mann Houlton, who bought a brownstone on that street in 1960 with her husband, William Houlton. The couple paid $18,000 for their home and then spent decades meticulously restoring and nurturing the brownstone and the neighborhood.        
Until one day the house began returning the favor.        
For nearly 15 years, it has been a luxury rental property, bringing the Houltons’ grown daughters about $14,000 a month in recent years. And now it is a house for sale, with exceptional original detail, a manicured garden and an asking price of nearly $5 million.        
Clearly, the street is not so crummy anymore.        
“If a passer-by looks closely at the front window of the Houltons’ brownstone at 46 West 94th Street, he can see three bullet holes,” a 1972 article in The New York Times said.        
“Two of the bullet holes were there when we bought the house,” Ms. Houlton recounted in the article. “One happened after we moved in, during a riot in the street.”        
Their elder daughter, Jenny, was an infant at the time, the article said, and her mother hid her in a closet to protect her from stray bullets.        
Nonetheless, the couple stayed, and the house became the inspiration for something of an urban revival movement. In 1966, Ms. Houlton, whose work appeared under her maiden name, Peggy Mann, published “The Street of the Flower Boxes,” based on her and her husband’s experience encouraging children on their block to assemble, decorate and sell flower boxes to their neighbors, providing a modest yet extraordinarily effective lift to the neighborhood — perhaps shockingly so, to today’s cynical eyes. The book was turned into a television movie of the same name, which won a Peabody Award.        
The idea was then picked up by Keep America Beautiful, the organization that created the famous crying Indian ad, and turned into a national neighborhood beautification movement and competition. (A 1976 article in The New Yorker about the flower box project described West 94th Street as a place that “didn’t look so swell when flower boxes first appeared there, a few years ago, but is now the sort of block that makes New York City’s detractors sound stupid.”)        
In 1990, Ms. Houlton died, having written more than 35 books in her 65 years. A few years later, Mr. Houlton had a stroke that left him in need of constant assistance.        
“We didn’t have money for 24-hour care,” said Jennifer Houlton-Vinyl, once the infant daughter in the closet, now with two children of her own. “But what we did have was the house.”        
For a few years, the family offered free room and board to a small cast of young men in exchange for shifts taking care of their father, an arrangement that lasted until shortly before Mr. Houlton died.        
Then, about 15 years ago, the daughters took out a mortgage and remodeled the house. They put in a new kitchen and added a deck to the back garden. They updated the bathrooms and finally replaced the window pocked with bullet holes, which Betsy Houlton Robinson explained cheerfully had been kept “for posterity.” They created a high-end brownstone rental.        
“We’re attached to the house, and it was some way to make money,” Ms. Houlton-Vinyl said of their decision to become a landlord to the wealthy. “I mean, she’s a blacksmith,” she said of her sister, Betsy, who lives in Normandy, “and I’m a writer. So ...”        
Among their tenants have been bankers and diplomats, and the challenges at that level have been unusual — the diplomats, for example, had trouble figuring out where they would host their large formal dinner parties.        
All new residents can also decorate as they choose. The aesthetic of the current tenants could perhaps be best described as “lavish vampire,” with an enthusiasm for dark walls, heavy drapes and, in an upstairs den, what appears to be a monstrous elephant skull. They have even forsaken flower boxes for two conical trees at the top of the stoop.        
The bones of the house, however, are untouched, and since the house has been sold only three times since it was completed in 1896, a rare trove of original detail is still intact.        
“Because they’re paying so much money, it’s a pretty high maintenance job,” Ms. Houlton-Vinyl said. Her husband, Kosmo Vinyl — who, incidentally, was once a manager for a punk rock band, the Clash — acts as the brownstone’s superintendent and has to be available to the tenants more or less around the clock. (In addition to writing, Ms. Houlton-Vinyl works as a receptionist at a law firm, largely so her family can have health insurance, she said.)        
After nearly 15 years of being more or less on call for their tenants, Ms. Houlton-Vinyl said, she and her husband are ready for a bit more freedom. So the house is for sale, listed with Jane Beal and Rose Ann Nielsen of the Corcoran Group. According to the real estate Web site Streeteasy, its price tag of $4.995 million is just shy of the median sale price for recently sold town houses in the area. The sisters hope the home will have many suitors.        
“I had a friend compare it to a relationship,” Ms. Houlton Robinson said of the decision to sell the house. “It is sad, but maybe now the lovely lady will have the chance to be in another loving, long-term commitment.”

LONDON — Not since Georgia O’Keeffe’s sensual paintings has an artist made so much of the sexuality of flowers.        


But this was the fashion artist Christopher Kane who electrified London Fashion Week on Monday with a collection that swelled and slithered across the body, following the rise and curve, revealing skin through metallic-framed petals.        
At the same time, the collection was about the sweetness of pink color; the softness of fluffy pollen; the pleats, straight as stalks, of mid-calf skirts, and the word “petal” — a term of endearment in Mr. Kane’s native Scotland. That was used with the word “flower” as a print on sweater tops.        
“I was thinking of flowers being not just a pretty face. They produce oxygen and keep us alive,” said the designer backstage. “Sex education at school gave me a diagram of the sexual reproduction of a flower. The anatomy of a woman is so similar to a flower when you dissect it. So the photo synthesis was graphic flowers evolving into this beautiful, sensual shine.”        
The most beautiful part of the collection was to see Mr. Kane, just 31, break into full bloom. Everything had changed: the venue no longer the hyper-modern financial district high rise but a shambling brick warehouse. The pert girly style of his former collections had burst into ripe femininity.        
Every detail seemed perfectly selected: from shoes, slightly 1930s with their fold-back flaps; or the crocodile clips, closing a shoulder strap or holding up a swathe of skirt.        
Out of all this, the clothes — give or take a flare of metallic glitter or the cut-out pieces — had a normality and beauty that made them at once original but wearable.        
Kering, formerly PPR, the company that bought a majority stake in the Christopher Kane company last year, announced this week that it will open the designer’s first store on high-end Mount Street in London’s Mayfair district. It will be followed by a slow rollout in fashion capitals like New York, Milan and Paris, according to François-Henri Pinault, Kering’s chief executive, who sat front row at the show.        
“But there is no store theme yet. Christopher has to work out his ideas about how he wants the shop to be,” said Mr. Pinault. Judging by the collection, it will be beautiful with a tinge of sexuality and a crystal clear vision.        
Flowers were again to the fore at Burberry Prorsum, where the English rose — its petals showering the finale — were in the mind of the designer.        
“I really wanted it to feel like a little cuddle. It started off with a mood rather than a theme — a gentle spirit, kinder and warmer, more embracing,” said Christopher Bailey backstage.        
“I wanted it very soft and tender and joyous. I loved the idea of all these little English roses,” the designer said. “The colors are very powdery. I used a lot of English laces from Nottingham and Scottish cashmere. It’s a very British collection.”        
That was true for the soft cardigans, taking over from jackets in the show and the sweet country-garden colors that went from greenery to strawberry.        
Yet — apart from the plastic shoulder cape given to the hot model Cara Delevingne at the finale — there was precious little of the Burberry raincoats that would have been so useful in the sunshine-and-showers September day.        
Instead there were coats: tailored, plain, sweetly colored, with a touch of Celine’s minimalism, and a city, rather than a country charm. They were worn over the tops and skirts, often transparent in crunchy lace. Mr. Bailey has a way of creating links to his other collections: the visible lace underpants or a sudden flurry of polka dot pattern. But this show, without a hard edge, had a sweet serenity.        
The Erdem collection seemed to have the sweetness of marriage in mind — give or take the clumpy shoes that were presumably designed to ground the intricate laces and light chiffons, all in black and white.        
A grand piano and a cello gave a gentle touch to clothes in which the designer Erdem Moralioglu had left behind his colorful prints and body-curving dresses for a softer, wispier look.

The Long Island dealer at the center of an $80 million art forgery scheme that duped dozens of experts and buyers pleaded guilty on Monday to charges of wire fraud, money laundering and tax evasion.        


The dealer, Glafira Rosales, is the only person who has been indicted in connection with the fraud, which passed off fake paintings as the work of Modernist masters. But she is cooperating with federal prosecutors, who have said that they expect further arrests.        
What has particularly fascinated the art world is that the scores of paintings and drawings successfully presented as newly discovered works by some of the 20th century’s greatest artists were actually produced by a single man: an immigrant from China who painted out of his home and garage in Woodhaven, Queens.        
Ms. Rosales, wearing a charcoal pinstripe jacket and speaking in a halting, barely audible voice, acknowledged to Judge Katherine P. Failla in United States District Court in Manhattan that she had promoted paintings as the work of Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock and Robert Motherwell that “were, in fact, fakes created by an individual in Queens.”        
Investigators have said that 40 of the counterfeits were sold through Knoedler & Company, a venerable Upper East Side gallery that abruptly closed in November 2011 after being in business for more than 165 years. At least 23 other fakes were sold through a second Manhattan dealer, Julian Weissman. Ms. Rosales earned $33.2 million, while the galleries received more than $47 million in total, according to a statement issued by the Manhattan United States attorney, Preet Bharara.        
Knoedler; Ann Freedman, its former president; and Mr. Weissman are being sued in civil court by various clients who bought art provided by Ms. Rosales; they have all said that they were convinced that the works were genuine, though they have acknowledged that Ms. Rosales did not provide them with documentation to establish the art’s provenance.        
In court, Ms. Rosales, who had been arrested in May, dabbed at her eyes with a tissue after she detailed her role in the fraud and listened to the judge explain that she could owe up to $81 million in restitution and have to forfeit her home in Sands Point, N.Y.; her art collection; and her bank accounts. She also faces a maximum sentence of 99 years in prison, although her recommended sentence under federal sentencing guidelines is likely to be far less.        
Ms. Rosales’s co-conspirators are not named in the indictment. But people familiar with the case have identified the painter as Pei-Shen Qian, 73, a Chinese immigrant who came to the United States in 1981 and attended classes at the Art Students League in New York. He was discovered in the 1980s by Ms. Rosales’s partner and former boyfriend, who was named in the government’s papers only as co-conspirator “CC-1,” but is identified in other court documents as Jose Carlos Bergantiños Diaz.        
Both men were involved in marking the counterfeits with false signatures, according to the statement issued by Mr. Bharara’s office. The prosecutors said CC-1 had treated the works to give them “the false patina of age.”        
Mr. Qian was paid as little as a few thousand dollars for each work.        
Beginning in 1994, Ms. Rosales wove a story about these never-before-seen works, telling Knoedler and Mr. Weissman that the owner had inherited the works from his father and insisted on remaining anonymous.        
Mr. Bergantiños Diaz and Mr. Qian are believed to be out of the country. Most of the profits garnered by Ms. Rosales through the sale of the fakes were funneled through a bank account in Spain controlled by Mr. Bergantiños Diaz’s brother, according to court papers.        
Ms. Freedman’s lawyer, Nicholas A. Gravante Jr., said, “I have been assured in the strongest terms that nobody is contemplating filing any criminal charges against Ann Freedman.”

LONDON — Only a select few have ever heard of Bellville Sassoon. It is not that the British couture house did not have its fans: For more than five decades Bellville Sassoon’s gowns graced palaces, society balls and the red carpet. But the designers Belinda Bellville and David Sassoon didn’t like to talk about their work.        


The couture house’s typically British stiff upper lip has been loosened for a new exhibition, “The Glamour of Bellville Sassoon,” to open Sept. 20 at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London. It will run through Jan. 11.        
“Bellville Sassoon favored discretion over publicity, which meant they had an amazing career that a lot of people don’t really know about,” said Dennis Nothdruft, the curator who planned the exhibit as part of the museum’s 10th anniversary celebrations.        
Ms. Bellville hired Mr. Sassoon after seeing his Royal College of Art graduate collection in 1958. “Belinda was a classic deb-type and knew all the great society ladies of the day,” Mr. Sassoon said in an interview at the exhibition site. The company changed its name from Bellville et Cie to Bellville Sassoon in 1970 and Mr. Sassoon took ownership when Ms. Bellville retired in 1981.        
The exhibition will display about 80 bespoke and ready-to-wear creations, dated 1959 to 2012, when Mr. Sassoon closed his Chelsea workshop. “Couture orders dwindled toward the end, so retirement sort of happened to me — and after 55 years, I’d earned my rest,” said Mr. Sassoon, now 81.        
“We had to virtually beg, borrow and steal to get the dresses for the exhibition,” he added. “So many are one-offs, and it never occurred to me to keep any for myself.”        
The designer said the house had dressed “absolutely every female member of the British royal family you can think of, with the exception of the queen,” as well as most of Europe’s royal families, a clutch of Jordanian princesses and several shaykhahs of Qatar. Glitzy but untitled clients included Catherine Deneuve, Madonna and Julie Christie.        
“I loved the early ’70s best,” Mr. Sassoon said. “It was my period; the excess, the high demand for couture and there were plenty of fabulous balls.”        
Anecdotes trip off the couturier’s tongue. He describes a 1960 visit to Buckingham Palace to fit a bridesmaid gown for Princess Anne, then 9; Queen Elizabeth’s greatest anxiety was whether the dress was washable.        
In 1967, he arrived at Kensington Palace for an appointment with Princess Margaret — “a moody woman” — and found her “hidden in the basement whitewashing the walls in a burgundy velvet Yves Saint Laurent smoking suit with a polythene bag over it.”        
Audrey Hepburn was “so polite and effortless” and Liz Taylor was “late, but very charming.”        
Bellville Sassoon is perhaps best known for dressing Diana, Princess of Wales. Mr. Sassoon estimates he created more than 70 outfits, most notably her pink “going away” suit to start her honeymoon and the extravagant pale-blue organza gown she wore to a Victoria & Albert Museum event in November 1981, the night before the announcement she was pregnant with her first child.        
While it may be hard to believe that one of the princess’s favorite couturier houses was reticent about the spotlight, “Belinda was funny about publicity,” Mr. Sassoon said, “and besides we were too occupied with selling to our customers.”        
In 1987 the designer Lorcan Mullany was hired to increase the house’s ready-to-wear line. “From the late ‘80s couture got smaller and smaller and ready-to-wear took over sales, partly because people didn’t want to spend that kind of money, but also because they didn’t have the time,” Mr. Sassoon said. “Women with big careers just couldn’t justify the fittings.”        
Not that the ready-to-wear came cheap, he added: “During the last years, pieces cost up to £2,000 or £3,000, but that’s compared to a piece of couture that we’d sell for £20,000,” or $32,000.

Q. Why do lobsters turn from dark blue-green to red when boiled? And why are they that dark color in the first place? 


A. A relatively simple explanation for the color change emerged in a study published in 2002: Heat changes the shape of a protein called beta-crustacyanin in the shell, relaxing its bonds with the pigment astaxanthin. The freed pigment reflects wavelengths of light in the red spectrum.        
But it turned out that the heat-related shape change accounted for only about a third of the color difference, according to a 2005 study by Dutch researchers in The Journal of the American Chemical Society.        
The new research pointed to a complex quantum-physics interaction that would account for a much larger shift — and for the living lobster’s original color.        
When the red pigment is fully hidden in the enclosing protein, it absorbs all wavelengths of light, red as well as blue and green, so the lobster appears black.        
The previous research had found that the red pigment molecules were grouped in pairs within the crustacyanin, crossing each other in a tight X formation. The Dutch researchers calculated that they interfered with one another, causing shifts in their quantum energy states, thus altering the wavelengths of light that are absorbed.        
Using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy to examine protein-pigment interactions, the researchers found that this effect was a large one, suggesting that it is the primary source of lobster color.

Brooklyn Bridge Park has plenty going for it already: the waterfront promenades, the little corners where you escape into nature, the playgrounds and soccer fields. But it could use more wide-open green space, places to picnic or throw a Frisbee, the kinds of free-for-all gathering spots synonymous with the exercise of democracy and the flirtations of sunbathers. And another architectural landmark in the city never hurts.        


Voilà: A new plan, which should win city approval shortly, would give Pier 6, off Atlantic Avenue, a flowering meadow with seasonal grasses, a sprawling field and a triangular wooden viewing platform. That’s at the southern end of this spectacularly successful 1.3-mile-long Brooklyn park, where there’s already a maze of children’s playgrounds. The meadow and field would add breathing room to the pier and a mini-Great Lawn floating serenely over the East River.        
More to the point, the proposal also envisions a new work of public architecture whose distinctive shape its architect describes as a manta ray.        
A manta ray or, maybe, a humongous Tostito — in any case, a triangular platform, stepped and undulating, doing for Brooklyn Bridge Park sort of what the Boathouse does for Central Park. Creating a visual anchor for that end of the park as well as for the riverfront, it would become a perch from which to look not just over the harbor but also back at Brooklyn.        
The platform is by the Danish whiz kid Bjarke Ingels, who is angling to become the Next Big Thing in architecture. His firm, Bjarke Ingels Group, known as BIG, has been grabbing headlines and commissions with designs that seem tailor-made for glossy magazine spreads. Among them is the pyramidal, torquing apartment complex, with a courtyard nearly the size of a football field, now under construction on West 57th Street, at the Hudson River. At 39, Mr. Ingels has his formal tics already, but also a knack for turning architecture into landscape, which, in essence, is the task here.        
The brief is to complete the grounds devised for the undeveloped area of Pier 6. Michael Van Valkenburgh, the Brooklyn-based landscape architect whose firm has overseen the design of the whole park, has planned the meadow as a destination point for the walking path from Atlantic Avenue, and the big lawn to work as a single grand space, with the platform at the end of the pier.        
Mr. Ingels’s 6,000-square-foot design, which would command drop-dead views of Lower Manhattan, has a Baroque lilt, with twisting steps fanning out from the platform’s north side. Where a corner of the platform coincides with the north corner of the pier, the platform would be raised 17 feet on stilts to produce an effect resembling the prow of a ship. The architect calls this the work’s “ ‘Titanic’ moment” — he means the movie, not the wreck — the point to which one or two people could climb and stand at the railing, gazing out over the city. In essence, the architecture invites us all to come to a spot where we can feel alone.        
The design’s waves allude to the water and echo the soft curves of Mr. Van Valkenburgh’s hills and paths. At night, when lights go on along the steps and within the bench below, the platform would become a giant outdoor Dan Flavin sculpture. Should audiences congregate for concerts, it could be a stage, or seating for 300 people.        
The structure would cost $8 million, all to be raised privately. Brooklyn Bridge Park exemplifies the sort of public-private venture the Bloomberg administration has championed, with public spaces the priority, but dependent on private money. City authorities just chose Midtown Equities, a Brooklyn developer, to convert the historic Empire Stores, the waterfront warehouses north of the bridge that belong to Brooklyn Bridge Park. The stores will be turned into offices and retail spaces, with restaurants and the Brooklyn Historical Society on the ground floor. In turn, the project will throw off cash to operate the park.        
It’s a deal similar to the one for the hotel and residential complex now under construction on Pier 1, which the New York architect Jonathan Marvel has conceived for the developers Toll Brothers and Starwood. Mr. Marvel’s design defers to the park. The park should enhance the complex.        
I used to live on Atlantic Avenue, above the Damascus Bakery, and remember the grim walk west, toward the waterfront. That was a trip to nowhere. Now, even on a midweek morning, Pier 6 is buzzing with children, young parents, bikers and volleyball players.        
Since the park opened, in 2010, it has transformed the entire neighborhood. The diversity of the people who use it proves that it serves the whole borough. Mr. Ingels’s platform would add to it, as an elegant slab of contoured wood, lighter than concrete, allowing its supporting columns to remain thin. For the space underneath, the platform would provide a seamless, billowing roof, allowing for dozens of people to find some shade and relax at waterside cafe tables. It’s only a pity that the required wheelchair ramp and its railing along the structure’s edge mean that the platform feels partly disconnected from the lawn.        
The plan now awaits the Public Design Commission’s go-ahead and a patron for Mr. Ingels’s project.        
Brooklyn and the city deserve both.

ARCHER, Fla. — The rumble of a distant lawn mower, the whoosh of a passing motorist and the buzz of a pesky fly hung in the air at Bronson Speedway.         
The rural quiet of a warm Saturday allowed Ann Young, the owner of the small-town racetrack here, to listen to her doubts. Maybe she had made the wrong decision when she bought the speedway in 2011. Maybe running a short track on the weekends, about 1,100 miles from her family and her home in New York, was not worth the effort.        
Bronson Speedway sits on 36 grassy acres just outside the Florida town for which it is named: Bronson, population 1,100. The wood-plank grandstands do not quite reach the top of the sabal palm that brushes up against the scoring tower. A black and white checkered sidewalk leads to a white wood-paneled concession stand with three red-frame windows. A collectibles store stands a few feet away, but there are no souvenirs inside, and the door appears to be painted shut.        
“I just feel like there’s a reason why I need to be here,” Young said. “I don’t really know what it is yet.”        
The idea to buy the track started, almost as a joke, when Young and her husband, Chris, 60, were discussing a retirement project at their home in Calverton, N.Y., in 2010.        
Ann Young, 55, has been a registered nurse for 34 years, working her way up from a nursing school in Brooklyn to running the operating room at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center in Patchogue, N.Y. But her family’s passion has always been auto racing. Young has been going to racetracks since she was 5. Chris raced cars for more than four decades. And their son, Christopher, 19, started racing at 14.        
To humor her husband, Ann Young searched online using the phrase “racetrack for sale,” and the words “Bronson Speedway” appeared in the results. Knowing nothing about Bronson, Fla., or how to run a racetrack, she read on.        
A visit to Bronson and months of negotiating landed the Youngs an abandoned, three-eighths-mile, high-bank asphalt oval track with a 6,000-square-foot garage and two mobile homes for $700,000, according to Levy County property records.        
“I bought a speedway, they gave me the keys, and I went, ‘Oh, what do I do now?’ ” she said.        
Ten days after buying the track, the Youngs held a meet-and-greet for area residents and drivers. A group of them, curious to meet the new owners, turned up.        
“We had a pretty good opening day,” Young said, “but it was downhill after that.”        
More than two years later, the racetrack has made no money. Ann Young has had to dip into her family’s savings to make repairs, secure permits, update licenses and sometimes pay the drivers’ purses. Some racetrack staff members and volunteers have moved on to other jobs, or left because of disagreements with management about personnel and rule changes, the details of which they aired on online discussion boards.        
Some of the missteps have been self-inflicted; when a couple of cars showed for one sportsman class race, Young cut the purse in half, angering the drivers.        
“It was a mistake I would never make again,” she admitted, adding, “What that guy cost me on the Internet is what I didn’t pay on the purse.”        
Bringing in fans has been Young’s steepest challenge, but she is not alone. There are 1,396 registered racetracks in the United States and Canada, according to the National Speedway Directory. The attendance drop-off at small-town tracks has been attributed to more entertainment options, televised races and higher fuel prices, according to interviews with more than a dozen racetrack owners and promoters. But what has stayed the same at these smaller tracks are the personal connections that owners, drivers and staff members have to the sport. Small-town racing runs deeper than money. It is often tied to family.        
“A lot of people who are buying the racetracks, they typically have some type of involvement in the industry,” said Tim Frost, the publisher of the National Speedway Directory. “They raced as a kid, or they had a parent involved in the industry.”

Science,"










Long before he brought people into his laboratory at Columbia University to smoke crack cocaine, Carl Hart saw its effects firsthand. Growing up in poverty, he watched relatives become crack addicts, living in squalor and stealing from their mothers. Childhood friends ended up in prisons and morgues.        


Those addicts seemed enslaved by crack, like the laboratory rats that couldn’t stop pressing the lever for cocaine even as they were starving to death. The cocaine was providing such powerful dopamine stimulation to the brain’s reward center that the addicts couldn’t resist taking another hit.        
At least, that was how it looked to Dr. Hart when he started his research career in the 1990s. Like other scientists, he hoped to find a neurological cure to addiction, some mechanism for blocking that dopamine activity in the brain so that people wouldn’t succumb to the otherwise irresistible craving for cocaine, heroin and other powerfully addictive drugs.        
But then, when he began studying addicts, he saw that drugs weren’t so irresistible after all.        
“Eighty to 90 percent of people who use crack and methamphetamine don’t get addicted,” said Dr. Hart, an associate professor of psychology. “And the small number who do become addicted are nothing like the popular caricatures.”        
Dr. Hart recruited addicts by advertising in The Village Voice, offering them a chance to make $950 while smoking crack made from pharmaceutical-grade cocaine. Most of the respondents, like the addicts he knew growing up in Miami, were black men from low-income neighborhoods. To participate, they had to live in a hospital ward for several weeks during the experiment.        
At the start of each day, as researchers watched behind a one-way mirror, a nurse would place a certain amount of crack in a pipe — the dose varied daily — and light it. While smoking, the participant was blindfolded so he couldn’t see the size of that day’s dose.        
Then, after that sample of crack to start the day, each participant would be offered more opportunities during the day to smoke the same dose of crack. But each time the offer was made, the participants could also opt for a different reward that they could collect when they eventually left the hospital. Sometimes the reward was $5 in cash, and sometimes it was a $5 voucher for merchandise at a store.        
When the dose of crack was fairly high, the subject would typically choose to keep smoking crack during the day. But when the dose was smaller, he was more likely to pass it up for the $5 in cash or voucher.        
“They didn’t fit the caricature of the drug addict who can’t stop once he gets a taste,” Dr. Hart said. “When they were given an alternative to crack, they made rational economic decisions.”        
When methamphetamine replaced crack as the great drug scourge in the United States, Dr. Hart brought meth addicts into his laboratory for similar experiments — and the results showed similarly rational decisions. He also found that when he raised the alternative reward to $20, every single addict, of meth and crack alike, chose the cash. They knew they wouldn’t receive it until the experiment ended weeks later, but they were still willing to pass up an immediate high.        
These findings made Dr. Hart rethink what he’d seen growing up, as he relates in his new book, “High Price.” It’s a fascinating combination of memoir and social science: wrenching scenes of deprivation and violence accompanied by calm analysis of historical data and laboratory results. He tells horrifying stories — his mother attacked with a hammer, his father doused with a potful of boiling syrup — but then he looks for the statistically significant trend.        
Yes, he notes, some children were abandoned by crack-addicted parents, but many families in his neighborhood were torn apart before crack — including his own. (He was raised largely by his grandmother.) Yes, his cousins became destitute crack addicts living in a shed, but they’d dropped out of school and had been unemployed long before crack came along.        
“There seemed to be at least as many — if not more — cases in which illicit drugs played little or no role than were there situations in which their pharmacological effects seemed to matter,” writes Dr. Hart, now 46. Crack and meth may be especially troublesome in some poor neighborhoods and rural areas, but not because the drugs themselves are so potent.

ISTANBUL — The Turkish government said Monday that one of its fighter planes shot down a Syrian military helicopter that had flown into Turkish airspace, a potentially significant escalation of tensions between the neighbors and former allies, now bitterly divided over Syria’s civil war.        


An F-16 warplane intercepted a Russian-built Mi-17 helicopter as it crossed Turkey’s southern border, Turkish officials said. The helicopter’s crew was repeatedly warned by radio and did not turn back, they said. When the helicopter had strayed roughly a mile across the border, the jet fired on it, the officials said, and it crashed to the ground in Syria.        
“No one, from now on, will dare to violate Turkish borders in any way,” the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, told reporters in Paris on Monday evening, according to the semiofficial Anatolian News Agency.        
The Syrian Army confirmed that it had lost a helicopter that it said was on a reconnaissance mission and had mistakenly crossed into Turkish territory.        
The Syrian Army Command denounced Turkey’s reaction as “hasty” and said it was evidence of what it called the “real intentions of Erdogan’s government towards Syria, which is seeking escalation at the borders of the two countries,” the Syrian state news agency reported.        
The military action seemed to amplify the Turkish government’s increasing calls for a more muscular international response to the civil war in Syria.        
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was one of the first world leaders to call for the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and he has strongly backed the Syrian rebels. In recent weeks, Mr. Erdogan has called for a broad military intervention that would destabilize Mr. Assad’s government and force him from power — a position that has put the prime minister at odds with the Turkish public, which opposes any military role in the crisis.        
Mr. Erdogan has also reacted coolly to a plan by the United States and Russia to destroy or remove Syria’s chemical weapons, saying it would buy Mr. Assad more time. Mr. Davutoglu said Monday that the agreement “does not serve as an end to the Syrian crisis,” which he warned could escalate further even without chemical weapons.        
Until Monday, Turkey had largely refrained from unilateral military action against Mr. Assad’s forces, even after Syria shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012 and after stray shelling from Syria killed five civilians in a Turkish border village. Nor did the government retaliate in May, after it blamed Turkish citizens backed by Syrian intelligence agencies for twin car bombings that killed scores of people in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli.        
Turkey has shored up its defenses along its 550-mile-long border with Syria, including by deploying Patriot missile batteries. The Parliament revised the military’s rules of engagement last year to allow the army to retaliate against Syrian attacks.        
Turkish officials framed the downing of the helicopter on Monday as a defensive action that came after repeated warnings, rather than the kind of aggressive attack on Mr. Assad’s air force that the Syrian rebels have been pressing their international allies to conduct.        
The Turkish military said it had begun tracking the Syrian helicopter at 1:41 p.m., when the aircraft was 26 nautical miles from the border, and that warnings had been repeated until it was about five miles away. Officials released radar tracking that showed what the military said was the path of the helicopter, hugging the border in Syria’s Idlib Province for a time before crossing into Turkish territory, near the town of Yayladagi.        
The helicopter crashed less than a mile inside Syrian territory. On Monday in Ankara, Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said there was no information on the fate of the helicopter’s crew.        
Rebel activists in Syria asserted on Monday that a Syrian warplane had been shot down. Rebel groups quoted by the Anatolian News Agency said that rebel fighters had shot down a Syrian Air Force MIG-21. It was not possible to determine whether the rebels and Turkish officials were referring to separate episodes.        
Videos posted by rebel activists showed images of a fireball in the sky and what appeared to be someone with a parachute drifting toward the ground. One rebel fighter said he saw members of a jihadist brigade capture and behead a crew member.        
The fighter provided an image purporting to show the severed head of the slain Syrian airman, but neither his account nor the picture’s authenticity could be independently confirmed.

Moving From iPhoto 
To Aperture 
Q. I’d like to do more fine-tuning on my digital pictures than the current version of iPhoto allows. I am interested in the Aperture software Apple also makes, but how hard would it be to import my existing collection into Aperture? 
A. If you are running the most recent version of Apple’s iPhoto ’11, it should be easy to move images to Aperture, a more advanced program.The two programs use a unified picture-library format. With the latest version of Aperture, you can open your iPhoto library without having to export and then re-import pictures.        
Certain iPhoto tools also work between the two programs, like the Places and Faces features, customized albums and pictures shared with social media sites. One thing you cannot do, however, is have a photo library open in both programs at the same time. Apple has more on using iPhoto and Aperture together at support.apple.com/kb/HT5260.

Marin Cilic of Croatia, a former top-10 tennis player, has been suspended nine months for a doping violation.        


Cilic tested positive for nikethamide, a stimulant, at the BMW Open in Munich in May. The International Tennis Federation said Monday that it accepted Cilic’s contention that he ingested the substance inadvertently in glucose tablets and was not trying to cheat. As a result, the I.T.F. gave him a reduced penalty rather than a ban of up to two years.        
The suspension was retroactive to May 1, so Cilic, 24, can return to competition Jan. 31. He will be ineligible for the Australian Open.        
Cilic said he planned to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He said in a statement that he bought the tablets at a pharmacy in France.        
“I wish to emphasize that I have never knowingly or deliberately taken any banned substances in my life and that I am opposed to any use of performance-enhancing substances in sport,” Cilic said.        
He has not played since withdrawing from his second-round match at Wimbledon in June, citing a knee injury. The I.T.F. statement referred to Cilic’s accepting a “voluntary provisional suspension.” He was ranked as high as No. 9 in early 2010 after reaching the semifinals of the Australian Open. He was ranked No. 11 at the time of his failed test, but he is currently 24th.        
Cilic will lose all of his results, ranking points and prize money since the Munich tournament. His best result in that time was a runner-up finish to Andy Murray at the Queen’s Club grass-court tournament in London.        
Cilic’s suspension is the second doping-related penalty handed out to a former top 50 player this summer. In July, Viktor Troicki of Serbia, who was ranked as high as No. 49, was suspended for 18 months for refusing to provide a blood sample at the Monte Carlo Masters in April. Troicki is also appealing his suspension.

KABUL, Afghanistan — An unpublished United Nations report on female police officers in Afghanistan found accounts of pervasive sexual violence and harassment by their male colleagues, according to Afghan and Western officials familiar with the report.        


The report, which the United Nations has circulated only among senior Afghan officials at the Interior Ministry, found that about 90 percent of the policewomen interviewed described sexual harassment and sexual violence as a serious problem, and that about 70 percent of the policewomen said that they had personally experienced sexual harassment or sexual violence themselves, according to people who saw the report or had it described to them.        
While a much smaller fraction reported either being raped or otherwise sexually assaulted, the overall picture was of a police force in which women were constantly at risk.        
Although the report has not been made public and was not made available to The New York Times, two other recent reports touched on similar problems, though they did not focus as closely on the issue of sexual assault and harassment.        
Ghulam Mujtaba Patang, who stepped down as interior minister in August, described the United Nations report’s broad outlines, but questioned its findings. He said that after reading the report he sent a team to investigate the situation of female police officers and that none of the women his team spoke to complained of such mistreatment.        
“If an Afghan policewoman is being raped or sexually harassed, they would report that — they wouldn’t keep it secret,” he said.        
The chief spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Seddiq Seddiqi, said he thought the report had “some exaggeration of the issues and the problems.”        
Both men insisted, however, that the ministry was committed to improving the situation of policewomen.        
The report, according to two people familiar with it, surveyed nearly 10 percent of the female police force. United Nations officials would not discuss its details.        
“We are working with the ministry on follow-up to the report and to put in place improvements,” said Georgette Gagnon, the United Nations director of human rights for Afghanistan.        
Few subjects are as taboo in Afghanistan as sexual behavior, and female victims of sexual attacks are often accused of immorality, shunned and sometimes jailed.        
Women’s rights advocates said that because Afghan policewomen were afraid of being penalized for revealing the problem, it was extremely difficult to get them to talk about abuse. That is all the more true if the person committing the sexual abuse is their commander or one of his close friends on the police force.        
The policewomen interviewed by The Times said they feared being fired or demoted, or being sent to work in a job that was far away from their home if they complained.        
Most policewomen are low-level security screeners at checkpoints or government buildings, and in many instances they are the only person earning money in the family and desperately need their salaries — usually around $240 per month.        
A further disincentive to talking publicly about sexual abuse or coercion is that many Afghans already believe female police officers have loose morals simply because they are willing to work in public with men who are not relatives. If a woman admits that she is under pressure to have sex, conservative relatives might force her to quit — or even kill her to expiate the perceived dishonor to the family.        
General Patang said he had visited policewomen in all of the provinces and had never heard a complaint about sexual abuse. Most mentioned discontent with salaries or a lack of promotions, he said.        
“I think the reason they told these things to the U.N. and did not mention it to my inquiry was that these were mainly illiterate women who thought they might gain more attention and support by making these claims,” he said.        
The situation for female police officers is made more difficult because there are so few of them — barely 1 percent of the roughly 155,000-member force.

From biology class to “C.S.I.,” we are told again and again that our genome is at the heart of our identity. Read the sequences in the chromosomes of a single cell, and learn everything about a person’s genetic information — or, as 23andme, a prominent genetic testing company, says on its Web site, “The more you know about your DNA, the more you know about yourself.”        


But scientists are discovering that — to a surprising degree — we contain genetic multitudes. Not long ago, researchers had thought it was rare for the cells in a single healthy person to differ genetically in a significant way. But scientists are finding that it’s quite common for an individual to have multiple genomes. Some people, for example, have groups of cells with mutations that are not found in the rest of the body. Some have genomes that came from other people.        
“There have been whispers in the matrix about this for years, even decades, but only in a very hypothetical sense,” said Alexander Urban, a geneticist at Stanford University. Even three years ago, suggesting that there was widespread genetic variation in a single body would have been met with skepticism, he said. “You would have just run against the wall.”        
But a series of recent papers by Dr. Urban and others has demonstrated that those whispers were not just hypothetical. The variation in the genomes found in a single person is too large to be ignored. “We now know it’s there,” Dr. Urban said. “Now we’re mapping this new continent.”        
Dr. James R. Lupski, a leading expert on the human genome at Baylor College of Medicine, wrote in a recent review in the journal Science that the existence of multiple genomes in an individual could have a tremendous impact on the practice of medicine. “It’s changed the way I think,” he said in an interview.        
Scientists are finding links from multiple genomes to certain rare diseases, and now they’re beginning to investigate genetic variations to shed light on more common disorders.        
Science’s changing view is also raising questions about how forensic scientists should use DNA evidence to identify people. It’s also posing challenges for genetic counselors, who can’t assume that the genetic information from one cell can tell them about the DNA throughout a person’s body.        
Human Blueprint 
When an egg and sperm combine their DNA, the genome they produce contains all the necessary information for building a new human. As the egg divides to form an embryo, it produces new copies of that original genome.        
For decades, geneticists have explored how an embryo can use the instructions in a single genome to develop muscles, nerves and the many other parts of the human body. They also use sequencing to understand genetic variations that can raise the risk of certain diseases. Genetic counselors can look at the results of genetic screenings to help patients and their families cope with these diseases — altering their diet, for example, if they lack a gene for a crucial enzyme.        
The cost of sequencing an entire genome has fallen so drastically in the past 20 years — now a few thousand dollars, down from an estimated $3 billion for the public-private partnership that sequenced the first human genome — that doctors are beginning to sequence the entire genomes of some patients. (Sequencing can be done in as little as 50 hours.) And they’re identifying links between mutations and diseases that have never been seen before.        
Yet all these powerful tests are based on the assumption that, inside our body, a genome is a genome is a genome. Scientists believed that they could look at the genome from cells taken in a cheek swab and be able to learn about the genomes of cells in the brain or the liver or anywhere else in the body.        
In the mid-1900s, scientists began to get clues that this was not always true. In 1953, for example, a British woman donated a pint of blood. It turned out that some of her blood was Type O and some was Type A. The scientists who studied her concluded that she had acquired some of her blood from her twin brother in the womb, including his genomes in his blood cells.        
Chimerism, as such conditions came to be known, seemed for many years to be a rarity. But “it can be commoner than we realized,” said Dr. Linda Randolph, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles who is an author of a review of chimerism published in The American Journal of Medical Genetics in July.        
Twins can end up with a mixed supply of blood when they get nutrients in the womb through the same set of blood vessels. In other cases, two fertilized eggs may fuse together. These so-called embryonic chimeras may go through life blissfully unaware of their origins.        
One woman discovered she was a chimera as late as age 52. In need of a kidney transplant, she was tested so that she might find a match. The results indicated that she was not the mother of two of her three biological children. It turned out that she had originated from two genomes. One genome gave rise to her blood and some of her eggs; other eggs carried a separate genome.        
Women can also gain genomes from their children. After a baby is born, it may leave some fetal cells behind in its mother’s body, where they can travel to different organs and be absorbed into those tissues. “It’s pretty likely that any woman who has been pregnant is a chimera,” Dr. Randolph said.

LAKE FOREST, Ill. — When he tied a PGA Tour record by shooting a 59 on Friday, Jim Furyk had difficulty explaining how he had managed such a feat, caught among luck, skill and sheer happenstance. After he let his latest final-round lead slip away at the BMW Championship at Conway Farms on Monday, there was no mystery.        


“From tee to green, it was plenty good enough,” Furyk said. “But from Holes 6 through 18, I just didn’t putt well enough.”        
A downpour wiped out most of Sunday’s scheduled final round, and Furyk began Monday with a one-stroke lead. After a birdie on the 10th hole, he had a two-shot lead at 15 under par.        
But Zach Johnson shot a six-under 65 and birdied three of the last seven holes to finish 16 under, his furious comeback snatching victory from Furyk, who shot a 71 and finished 13 under. Nick Watney was second after a seven-under 64 that left him 14 under.        
“A phenomenal day,” Johnson said. “One of the best final rounds I probably have come up with in a while, especially coming down the stretch.”        
For Furyk, it was an all-too-familiar scene, as he was unable to deliver crucial putts with victory within his grasp. It has been three years since he won the Tour Championship. He has flirted with the top of the leader board since, but he has not won a tournament. Monday made it the sixth consecutive time he failed to convert at least a share of the lead after 54 holes into a win.        
Furyk lost the lead to Johnson on the 13th hole when his 5-foot par putt lipped out. On the 16th hole, Johnson nailed an 18-foot birdie putt from just off the green. He pumped his fist as the ball rolled into the cup. Furyk bogeyed the 16th — his third bogey of the back nine — and Johnson birdied the 17th.        
“The wrong way to ever think about a lead is holding on,” Furyk said. “I felt like the idea today was to go out, be aggressive and hit the ball at the pin — try to shoot four or five under and make the rest of the field chase me. I just wasn’t able to do it.”        
Furyk, though, will be part of next week’s Tour Championship field in Atlanta, which will feature the top 30 golfers in the FedEx Cup standings. The winner of the Cup wins a $10 million prize.        
Watney’s strong finish earned him a spot after he entered the weekend ranked 34th, and Johnson’s win ensured him the Cup championship with another victory next week.        
The biggest mover was Luke Donald, a graduate of nearby Northwestern University and a member of Conway Farms. Donald shot a 66 and finished 11 under. He began the day 54th in the standings but after five birdies in his last seven holes, he squeaked into the top 30 at No. 29.        
Tiger Woods, who shot a 71 and finished nine under, leads the point standings.        
Lee Westwood and Harris English fell out of the top 30. Westwood is one of several prominent players who will not compete for the FedEx Cup, including Rory McIlroy, who entered the season ranked No. 1 in the world. Other notable absences are Bubba Watson and Rickie Fowler.        
The suburbs in this area have provided Furyk some of his greatest triumphs and worst defeats.        
He won his only major, the 2003 United States Open, at Olympia Fields about 60 miles away, and the 2005 Western Open at nearby Cog Hill.        
But he also bogeyed the final two holes at Medinah last year to lose a duel with Sergio García on the final day of the Ryder Cup. The loss helped Europe stage a comeback to beat the United States.        
After another difficult finish, Furyk seemed content to take the good with the bad.        
“I’ll be disappointed I didn’t win,” Furyk said. “But we got some positives. I am playing really well and going to a golf course I really like next week in Atlanta.”        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 20, 2013An article on Tuesday about Zach Johnson’s victory in the BMW Championship golf tournament misstated Luke Donald’s position in the FedEx Cup standings after the tournament. He was 29th, not 28th.

Culture,"










The premise of this tiresome new novel by the critically acclaimed author Norman Rush sounds as if it had been lifted straight from “The Big Chill”: a group of now middle-aged college friends reunite to commemorate the death of one of their own. The result not only lacks that movie’s humor and groovy soundtrack but is also an eye-rollingly awful read.        


The novel’s preening, self-absorbed characters natter on endlessly about themselves in exchanges that sound more like outtakes from a dolorous group therapy session than like real conversations among longtime friends. Its title, “Subtle Bodies” — which refers to people’s “true interior selves,” whatever that means — is a perfect predictor of the novel’s solipsistic tone. Readers given to writing comments in their books are likely to find themselves repeatedly scrawling words like “narcissistic,” “ridiculous,” “irritating” and “pretentious” in the margins.        
There has always been a strain of self-consciousness in Mr. Rush’s writing, but in his earlier books, set in Botswana, where Mr. Rush once worked in the Peace Corps, the African setting provided him with an opportunity — brilliantly seized in his debut collection of stories, “Whites” — to exercise his reportorial eye and to place his characters’ personal dilemmas within the larger context of Westerners’ trying to come to terms with Africa and its colonial past. With each book since “Whites” (that is, the National Book Award-winning “Mating,” from 1991, and “Mortals,” 2003) his narratives and characters have grown more inner-directed: a process that has reached its cloying culmination in “Subtle Bodies.”        
Although most of this novel is set on an estate in the Catskills shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, it actually takes place largely inside the heads of a political activist named Ned and his possessive wife, Nina — who both, it quickly becomes apparent, live within the Mylar bubble of their marriage, obsessively dissecting each other’s emotions and moods. Ned thinks of Nina as “his honey monkey.” Nina thinks of Ned as “a sort of Jesus, a secular Jesus.” When Ned and Nina both wear jeans, she thinks of them as “a symphony in denim.”        
Ned has rushed from California to the Catskills, where his friend Douglas has just died, and Nina has followed in hot pursuit because she’s ovulating now and wants to have a child; she’s furious that he’s picked this moment to get on an airplane without her.        
Back in the 1970s, we learn, Ned was part of a clique at New York University, a band of students, who, as Nina understands it, thought of themselves as “a group of wits,” “superior sensibilities of some kind.” They were the sort of folks who referred to themselves as “cineastes” because they went to movies at the Thalia. They liked to use words like “outré,” referred to graffiti artists as “ulterior decorators” and said that “Pinot Noir meant don’t urinate at night.” When they listened to records, no one was allowed to speak.        
Douglas (who seems to have driven a lawn mower too close to the edge of a ravine) was the leader of the pack. Reminiscent of the charismatic genius figures in Iris Murdoch novels, he was an intellectual guru for the others, though it’s baffling why anyone would look up to such a pompous jerk.        
Douglas picked up his college girlfriend Claire with the line “I stand here lonely as a turnstile,” and found it amusing to insert the word “egad” into every answer he gave in a class. One of the group remembers that Douglas “wished if we all outlived him, we would go to some park and hide in the trees, and when somebody came by, we would shout, ‘Great Pan is dead.’ ”        
This jokester attitude infected Douglas’s child rearing as well: he named his son Hume, after the philosopher David Hume, and encouraged him to be as outrageous as possible. Hume has grown up to be a feral teenager with a double Mohawk haircut; he often lives off by himself in the woods in a cabin or a yurt.        
The media are arriving to cover the memorial service for Douglas because he was “half-famous in the world” for debunking forgeries: “He’d proved that some sensational papers revealing that Alfred Dreyfus was in fact guilty of espionage were right-wing forgeries” and had shot down forgeries of “Milan Kundera’s so-called ‘Love Diaries.’ ”        
There’s a lot of mumbo-jumbo about Douglas’s philosophy — it’s said that he was “proposing various universal solutions to the problem of the persistence of evil in the world, in human relations” — and more portentous gibberish about his current mysterious work: Nina says she’s learned that “he took something called special commissions. Which means that he did work for the German Bundes-something and for the Israelis.”        
The other members of this novel’s cast are either as insufferable as Douglas or as flimsy as paper-doll mannequins. There’s Elliot, an officious stockbroker who made riskier and riskier bets in the market and seems to have lost a lot of his friends’ money. There’s Gruen, a chubby fellow who owns an agency that makes public service announcements for TV and who used to serve as “everybody’s confessor.” And there’s Joris, who goes to prostitutes for sex because he regards himself as a “married-woman fetishist” who would ruin any marriage he undertook the same way he ruined his first one; he rarely sees his two sons from that union, and says that “maritime law was a perfect field for him because absolute cynicism was the best Weltanschauung to have if you were in it, because the field was strewn with pirates and crooks.”        
Perhaps Mr. Rush means all this to read as black comedy, but it’s not remotely funny or compelling. In fact, it’s impossible to work up any interest in hearing what these absurdly self-important and poorly drawn characters might have to say as they drone on about themselves, with some random asides about Islam, Dadaism, anti-Semitism and abstract matters like “the sublime of deeply comprehending the world.”        
At one point, Ned says to Nina, “Why are we even talking about this?” It’s a question the reader might well ask about this claustrophobic and totally annoying novel.

TO THE EDITOR:        


Re “Learning What Works” (Sept. 3): While bringing more students to STEM fields is important, it cannot and should not be the major goal. All students benefit from learning science, especially science as process rather than rote memorization. Understanding and employing the critical thinking skills involved in the scientific method can help inform anyone’s life.        
Furthermore, we are all consumers of science. We use medicines, we vote for legislators who decide which scientific endeavors get government funding. We face issues like climate change, antibiotic resistance and genetically modified organisms. Don’t all of us deserve to really understand what we are debating?

TO THE EDITOR:        
I heartily agree with Salman Khan’s desire to position creativity and invention as the foci of STEM courses. To begin to address how we can do this, there are several critical success factors to consider. The most important of these is failure, since it is critical to figuring things out about the natural world or to creating a new design. Repeatedly reiterating the process used while making small changes, approaching the problem from multiple perspectives, or working backwards from the desired outcome — these are examples of strategies that we use in a wide variety of contexts, including STEM exploration.        
Our assessment of students needs to reward thoughtful detours and dead-ends if we want to encourage a culture of creativity and innovation in STEM classrooms.

The United States now ranks 11th in the world in cases of plague, according to a new survey of the disease.        


With 57 cases in a decade, it is far below the hardest-hit countries, Congo with 10,581 and Madagascar with 7,182. Still, it is the only wealthy country on the list; 97 percent of cases are in Africa.        
The survey was published Monday by The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.        
The Black Death killed a third of Europe in the 14th century, but cases are no longer found there, probably because cities keep rat populations down, said the author, Dr. Thomas C. Butler, a plague expert at Ross University Medical School in the West Indies. By contrast, in the American Southwest, the bacteria have shifted into rural squirrels and prairie dogs.        
Most cases come from flea bites, but in the United States a national parks biologist died after inhaling the bacteria while doing a necropsy of a mountain lion, and a 60-year-old geneticist in Chicago died, apparently after being careless with a research strain he believed was safe.        
The biggest outbreaks were among gold and diamond miners in Congo.        
Outbreaks were also traced to infected camel meat — one animal in Afghanistan infected 83 people. A 2009 outbreak among herdsmen in China was unusual because it was traced to infected dogs, who had been thought to be plague-resistant.        
Diagnoses can now be done with a rapid dipstick test and a vaccine may be available within a decade, Dr. Butler said. DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

TOKYO — The Ugly Americans terrorized Europeans and Asians with their booming voices and tennis shoes in the years after World War II. Decades later, Japanese tour groups descended from their air-conditioned buses to flash peace signs as they shot photos of every known landmark as well as laundry on backyard clotheslines.        


Now it is China’s turn to face the brunt of complaints. The grievances are familiar — they gawk, they shove, they eschew local cuisine, and last year, 83 million mainland Chinese spent $102 billion abroad — overtaking Americans and Germans — making them the world’s biggest tourism spenders, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization.        
Their numbers have also placed them among the most resented tourists. Mainland Chinese tourists, often laden with cash and unfamiliar with foreign ways, are tumbling out of tour buses with apparently little appetite for hotel breakfast buffets and no concept of lining up.        
The frustrations with the new tourists were summed up on a Thai online message board last spring, when users posted complaints about Chinese tourists using outdoor voices inside and spitting in public, among other transgressions.        
Last year, Thierry Gillier, a French fashion designer who founded the Zadig and Voltaire label, caused a small scandal when he told Women’s Wear Daily that Chinese tourists would not be welcome at his new Parisian boutique hotel. A barrage of international criticism persuaded him to apologize.        
Like their predecessors, the Chinese are newly wealthy and helpless with foreign languages, a combination complicated by their developing country’s historical isolation.        
“That China is a lawless, poorly educated society with a lot of money is going to take its toll on the whole world,” said Hung Huang, a popular blogger and magazine publisher in Beijing.        
Despite these faux pas, countries are practically tripping over themselves to attract Chinese tourists. Wedding companies in South Korea are trying to lure Chinese couples with bling-heavy ceremonies inspired by the viral music video “Gangnam Style.” A coastal county outside Sydney, Australia, is building a $450 million Chinese theme park centered on a full-size replica of the gates to the Forbidden City and a nine-story Buddhist temple. France, one of the most popular destinations for Chinese tourists already — 1.4 million visited in 2012 — is working to further bolster its appeal.        
Parisian officials recently published a manual for the service industry that offers transliterated Mandarin phrases and cultural tips for better understanding Chinese desires, including this tidbit: “They are very picky about gastronomy and wine.”        
To judge from the grumbling across the globe, such guidelines may be necessary. But the greatest opprobrium seems to be coming from fellow Chinese. In May, a mainland Chinese tourist in Luxor, Egypt, discovered that a compatriot had carved his own hieroglyphics on the wall of a 3,500-year-old temple. “Ding Jinhao was here,” it declared. A photo of the offending scrawl spread rapidly on Chinese social media, and outraged citizens tracked down the 15-year-old vandal. The uproar subsided after his parents issued a public apology.        
Embarrassed by the spate of bad press that month, Wang Yang, China’s vice premier, publicly railed against the poor “quality and breeding” of Chinese tourists who tarnish their homeland’s reputation. “They make loud noises in public, scratch graffiti on tourist attractions, ignore red lights when crossing the road and spit everywhere,” he said, according to People’s Daily.        
Despite his admonition, articles with headlines like “Chinese Bride Brawls in French Lavender Field” continue to appear in the state media.        
Ms. Hung, the blogger, blames the Communist Party’s tumultuous rule for China’s uncivilized behavior abroad. “There’s an entire generation who learned you don’t pay attention to grooming or manners because that’s considered bourgeois,” she said. While Chinese are more open to Western ideas now, that has not necessarily sunk in when actually interacting with the outside world. “They think, ‘The hell with etiquette. As long as I have money, foreigners will bow to my cash.’ ”

MGMT 


“MGMT” (Columbia)        
Something’s always looming and buzzing — or burbling, or clattering, or tapping, or ratcheting, or blipping, or quavering — near the foreground throughout MGMT’s  third album, “MGMT.” It makes the album both testing and, eventually, rewarding.        
Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser, who write and record as MGMT, have embraced excess since MGMT’s 2007 debut album, “Oracular Spectacular.” Their lyrics are ornately elusive, their arrangements deploy a neo-psychedelic profusion of instruments, and many of their songs pack in multiple episodes. MGMT trimmed back those tendencies enough to start their major-label career with three singles from “Oracular Spectacular” that pushed forward drumbeats and keyboard hooks to hint at 1970s pop in “Time to Pretend,” “Electric Feel” and the two-million-selling “Kids.” But MGMT’s second album, “Congratulations” in 2010, spurned pop mechanics, reaching back to the most baroque confections of 1960s pop, yielding no hits.        
Behind the disco-ball gleam of “Oracular Spectacular” was a fascination with youthful bravado and disillusionment; the labyrinthine songs of “Congratulations” grappled — and quarreled — with commercial success. On “MGMT,” Mr. VanWyngarden and Mr. Goldwasser have even larger ambitions. They ponder purpose, fate and mortality in songs like “Mystery Disease,” “Your Life Is a Lie” and “I Love You Too, Death.”        
The album’s keynote is borrowed: “Introspection,” a folk-rock song from a 1968 album by a Long Island songwriter who called himself Faine Jade. It vows, “There’s a reason, and I will someday find the plan.” MGMT are less optimistic; their songs see growing malaise and the inevitability of loss and deterioration.        
Which explains the sound. There’s still a late-1960s foundation to most songs, while MGMT make fewer digressions from verse-chorus-bridge than on “Congratulations.” But the music has turned less antiquarian. With the producer Dave Fridmann, MGMT have piled on layers and loops of percussion, electronics and effects: an almost overwhelming welter of activity, a meticulous clamor that wells up and changes throughout every track. It’s the entropy that, sooner or later, awaits us all. JON PARELES 
JUSTIN MOORE 
“Off the Beaten Path” 
(The Valory Music Company)        
Stand at attention for the recitation of names of our new country-music heroes. “You’re a little bit of JLo, a little bit of Kim Kardashian,” Justin Moore sings on “I’d Want It to Be Yours,” which extols the virtues of what Trace Adkins called the “honky-tonk badonkadonk.” Mr. Moore, too, is inspired by what bubbles out of Daisy Duke shorts: “Looks like two little pigs in a tow sack/ I’m telling you right now, baby, you got back.”        
So Mr. Moore is a bad boy? Someone who not only has brought the genre low, but who wants to poison it with pop culture and hip-hop references?        
He is far more wily than that. “Off the Beaten Path” is his third strong album, each of which engages in a bait and switch: cloaking old-school values with new-school references. He is in no way a dissenter, merely someone who understands that old forms can stand even stronger with injections of new ideas.        
Without the vintage quaver in Mr. Moore’s voice — it’s heaviest on “For Some Ol’ Redneck Reason” — or the thickness of the guitars in his arrangements, these songs would have other meanings. But Mr. Moore is solid in his convictions: that country music of the 1970s, the more accessible side of the outlaw years, is worth preserving, and that the true modern spirit of that sound is mindful of the rest of the world.        
He’s also capable of nonideological beauty: “Old Habits,” a duet with Miranda Lambert with echoes of George Jones and Tammy Wynette, or “That’s How I Know You Love Me,” about the taming of a difficult man written with elegance and complexity by Justin Weaver, Rodney Clawson and Chris Tompkins. And he’s capable of playing it safe, too, with “This Kind of Town” or “Country Radio,” which embrace old tropes without improving them.        
“I don’t care what you listen to, how you wear your hair, you can paint it blue/ Hey, it takes all kinds,” Mr. Moore sings on the album’s opener, “Old Back in the New School.” But really Mr. Moore wants it the other way around, for the new to season the old. “I don’t mind some attitude, a rebel heart/ Hell, I got one too,” he adds, “but you still gotta walk the line.” JON CARAMANICA 
KENNY GARRETT 
“Pushing the World Away” 
(Mack Avenue)        
Focus has never seemed like a problem for the alto and soprano saxophonist Kenny Garrett, who at 52 still possesses the taut, molten sound that made him a force nearly 30 years ago. But the title of his new album, “Pushing the World Away,” is meant to suggest a respite from daily distractions. Judging by the clarity and intensity of the results, Mr. Garrett had to do a lot of pushing.        
His chosen path as a bandleader builds on the mid-’60s terrain of the John Coltrane Quartet — flagrantly, ingeniously — and there’s a typical amount of slashing polyrhythm and modal expedition here. That might be a problem if Mr. Garrett’s current band, with the pianist Vernell Brown, the bassist Corcoran Holt, the drummer McClenty Hunter and the percussionist Rudy Bird, didn’t do this sort of thing imposingly well. So too do the colleagues who sub in for parts of the album, like the pianist Benito Gonzalez and the drummer Marcus Baylor.        
As a composer Mr. Garrett is often quick to show his hand. “Hey, Chick” is his nod to Chick Corea, a longtime collaborator; the next track is “Chucho’s Mambo,” a tribute to the pianist Chucho Valdés. There’s also a springy calypso, “J’ouvert (Homage to Sonny Rollins)”; and a churchly ballad with strings, “Brother Brown,” for the pianist Donald Brown, who helped produce the album.        
Working in that capacity, Mr. Brown should have talked Mr. Garrett out of a smooth-jazz cover of “I Say a Little Prayer.” Maybe it’s meant as a palate cleanser before the title track, an odd-metered incantation so literal-minded that it incorporates actual chanting. NATE CHINEN

Wearing a bow tie, a gray cardigan and glasses, the composer-bassist Doug Balliett stood in an intimate room in the Gershwin Hotel on Friday evening and narrated a rap cantata inspired by the mythological story of Diana and Actaeon.        


Mr. Balliett’s vivid cantata concluded a thoughtfully conceived program, inspired by Diana and presented by the fresh-faced ensemble New Vintage Baroque. The group juxtaposes early music with commissions, and this season is exploring characters from Book III of Ovid’s “Metamorphoses.”        
In the wood paneled, red-curtained space, Mr. Balliett introduced himself as the “tour guide and mythographer for the evening” and provided entertaining commentary on Diana, moon goddess of the hunt, and other legends.        
Mr. Balliett’s texts, which he delivered with emotive precision using a microphone, reflected the pacing and mood of Ovid, with contemporary twists and instrumental interjections that mirrored the words. An agitated string accompaniment added tension to the heated verbal depiction of Actaeon’s being chased and devoured by his hounds. The cantata ended with:        
And was Diana appeased?        
Yes, she was really quite pleased.        
Common talk wavered this way and that.        
Some said the punishment was crueler than just.        
Others said the virgin had done what she must.        
And both sides defended their arguments.        
The music making was polished and expressive throughout the intermissionless program, divided into sections: “The Deeds and Nature of Diana,” “The Sacred King and His Tanist” and “Diana the Lover.” The nine-member instrumental ensemble played the Overture from Charpentier’s “Actéon” and Rebel’s “Caractères de la Danse” with buoyant pulse and appealing energy.        
Interspersed with the rap cantata and instrumental interludes were several excerpts from seldom-performed secular French Baroque cantatas, a genre often used in salons and amateur music making and described by one 17th-century composer and scholar as a way “to soften the sorrows of solitude, without all the trouble, expense and paraphernalia of an opera.”        
The soprano Mary Feminear and the mezzo soprano Thea Lobo sang expressively in selections from Nicolas Bernier’s “Nymphes de Diane.” The tenor Owen McIntosh proved a charismatic interpreter in excerpts from Bernier’s “Aminte et Lucrine.”        
The lovestruck Diana was the heroine of Scenes II and III from the opera-ballet “Aréthuse,” by André Campra, an important composer who bridged the era between Lully and Rameau. Mr. McIntosh joined Ms. Lobo for an ardent rendition of the love duet between Diane and Edimion, the handsome young mortal shepherd she adores.

SAPPORO, Japan — The road to Japan’s energy future runs through a cluster of low buildings in this city, the largest on the northern island of Hokkaido.        


Here, working on their own and in collaboration with American scientists, researchers are studying sediment cores containing methane hydrates, icy constructs of water molecules with the explosive gas methane trapped within.        
Hydrate-containing sediments are found in large amounts around the world, both under the sea and to a lesser extent in permafrost. If they can be tapped safely and economically, they could be an abundant source of fuel, especially for countries like Japan that have few energy reserves of their own.        
The Japanese researchers’ work has already borne fruit: in March, the government announced that it had successfully produced methane from hydrates in sediments under the Pacific Ocean. The effort, conducted from a drilling ship in the Nankai Trough about 100 miles east of Osaka, was the world’s first hydrate production test in deep water.        
But scientists say there is still much that is unknown about the unusual compounds, sometimes referred to as “flammable ice,” and that the commercial production of gas from them is still far-off. “We need to know more about the physical properties of hydrates themselves, and of the sediments as well,” said Hideo Narita, the director of the research laboratory, part of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, which is financed largely by the government.        
Further research, here and at labs around the world, will help scientists better understand the environmental impact of hydrate production, including the possible release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the sea or atmosphere. There is also the potential for subsea landforms to become unstable when hydrates are removed.        
Timothy S. Collett, a research geologist with the United States Geological Survey, said that despite all the talk about their potential as an energy resource, “hydrates are largely still a scientific issue.”        
The research poses special challenges because hydrates form under high pressure, caused by the weight of all the seawater or rock above them, and that pressure must be maintained when the sediment cores are analyzed. If it is not, the hydrates within quickly dissociate into water and gas, and the sediments “look like chocolate mousse,” said Carlos Santamarina, a professor at Georgia Tech.

I’VE been involved in the television industry for 30 years, and I’ve had to travel almost all of that time. In my last job, I traveled about 45 weeks out of the year, and was sometimes gone for three or four days.        


I think there are three phases to business travel. During the first phase, you love it. I would get excited about every trip, even if it was to some small city that wasn’t all that glamorous. In the next phase, you hate it. I was in this phase for quite a while. I was tired of the hassle of flying, sleeping in hotels and being away from home. In the third phase, you realize you can’t win, so you just tolerate it. That’s where I’m at right now. I’m not going to make myself crazy if there’s a delay or cancellation, but I’m not loving the whole idea of travel.        
Most of my business trips involve going to conventions and meeting with everyone we do business with at CABLEready. I’m anything but a quiet guy, but I find myself not talking much on the plane or in the airport.        
Years ago I was coming back from a convention and almost all the passengers on the plane were involved in the television industry. It was a lot of fun. A woman sitting next to me asked if we all knew each other, and I explained that a lot of the passengers attended the same television convention that I did. She then told me she hated television, and for three hours I had to listen to exactly why she hated TV. I asked her what she did for a living and she told me she was a lawyer. I am too polite to have a conversation about why people may not like lawyers.        
I remember the very first time I was upgraded. I was a senior at Central Michigan University and a friend and I were headed to the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas. We were on our way to the airport, but our car couldn’t handle the snow. We finally got to the airport but our flight was canceled. I started talking to the airline clerk and told her our tale of woe, and she booked us on the next flight out of Detroit.        
We were even upgraded to first class. I thought it was awesome, and when the attendant came by to take our drink order I was in awe. I reached for my wallet, and the attendant told me quite firmly that first-class passengers never pay for their drinks. I thought that was the coolest thing ever.        
Even though I just tolerate business travel, some experiences can make me love it again. In January of this year, I had to go to a convention in Miami. I flew into Fort Lauderdale and planned on renting a car and driving to Miami. The original rental I got had some issues and when I took it back because of those problems, I was offered an upgrade. I figured I would take the upgrade and when I saw what they gave me I couldn’t stop smiling. It was a screaming orange 2012 Dodge Challenger. I was in heaven. I even took the car down to Biscayne Bay since I had an extra day before I needed to get home. I felt like a kid back in Detroit driving that car, which I guess proves that you can take the boy out of Detroit, but you can’t take Detroit out of the boy.

DID I actually just pay $55.58 for a simple omelet and coffee from room service at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel in Southern California last week?        


Yes, I did. It was very early; my laptop was misbehaving; the clock was ticking toward deadline; I hadn’t had dinner the night before. Still, that’s the first time I’ve experienced buyer’s remorse over an omelet, though it arrived quickly and was actually pretty good.        
Any business trip has peaks and valleys, so I thought I would pass along some examples from my most recent, for a few days at the annual Airline Passenger Experience trade show in Anaheim, with an added stop in Los Angeles.        
The airfare, a cheap $231.80 round trip on American Airlines between Tucson and Los Angeles, was a peak. So was my Avis rental car, a complimentary upgrade to a sporty Volvo XC60 that cost $175.30 for a week, including all those annoying taxes and fees.        
But a valley also came with the car. The electronic dashboard interface — the controls for everything other than actually making the car go — was baffling. As I drove, I tried to figure out unfathomable symbols and notices, from “Brian’s iPhone,” which for some reason flashed on the dashboard screen whenever I tried in vain to regulate the air-conditioner, to an elaborately designed radio that resisted my efforts to change the channel.        
So the guy who passed me on the 105 tapping his horn and waving to signal that my rear windshield wiper remained on, even though it was a sunny day, should know that hip-hop music also was blasting inside my car in maddening synchronization with the wipers that I couldn’t turn off. Once home, incidentally, I read that a J. D. Power report in June said one of the top complaints of new car owners this year was incomprehensible high-tech dashboard-control design.        
Speaking of top complaints, the airport security hassle always ranks high. Again there was a peak and a valley on my trip. The peak was the Tucson airport, where the Transportation Security Administration screeners are invariably courteous and friendly. The valley was reached on my return flight at Los Angeles International Airport.        
Thanks to my membership in Global Entry, I had the coveted PreCheck certification on my boarding pass for a fast-pass through security. But as I strolled happily through the metal detector without having to remove my shoes or take out my laptop, a glowering T.S.A. screener blocked my advance and told me, basically, not so fast, buster. I had been randomly selected to be swabbed down for explosives.        
“Hold your palms out,” the screener barked at me as she tugged on rubber gloves.        
“How about you say ‘Please’?” I replied. This displeased her mightily, but after passing the no-bomb-traces-on-palms test, I was allowed to proceed.        
I later told David Castelveter, a spokesman for the T.S.A., that, while my encounters with screeners were usually pleasant and professional, this one bothered me, partly because it had clouded my first experience with PreCheck. “I can’t comment on the particulars, but the officers as part of their training are taught how to properly interact with customers. We hold them to a very high standard of customer interaction,” Mr. Castelveter said.        
The T.S.A. had other worries last week, to be sure. The night before, I later read, a former T.S.A. agent was arrested on charges of making “unspecified threats” against the airport in an eight-page letter titled “The End of America, the End of Satan.” That same agent, according to The Los Angeles Times, had earlier resigned after reports that he had humiliated a 15-year-old girl at the airport in June for what he called her inappropriate attire.        
Peaks and valleys! The night before my return home I had a peak, staying at the Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles Airport, a good midlevel hotel close by the airport, where I had managed to score a nightly rate of $98.75 (taxes and fees included) through the Priceline Name Your Own Price blind-bidding service.        
When I got home, I realized that I had left a single brown dress shoe behind in my room. I phoned the hotel and spoke with a friendly housekeeping manager, Juana Ortiz, who said, “I have your shoe and will send it to you.”        
Then, alas, I spent an hour online and on the phone with FedEx, trying to update the expired American Express Platinum Card number on my account. My old card had been hacked during a previous trip, and I needed my FedEx account updated so that Ms. Ortiz could send the shoe. I don’t yet know whether that worked, because my FedEx account won’t let me see my details without approval from “the administrator,” who happens to be me.        
As to the brown shoe that I stupidly forgot, one way or another I am confident that Ms. Ortiz will get it back to me. Which will be another peak.

MOSCOW — American farmers are getting an unexpected windfall from a contentious fight between Russia and Belarus, a former Soviet splinter state.        


The subject of the fight is potash, a fertilizer. The score so far: One imprisoned Russian business executive, the disintegration of a once-effective cartel that kept world potash prices high and political tension between the two countries.        
What is being called the “fertilizer war” is the latest of numerous trade and economic spats between Russia and Belarus, whose leaders, though presiding over similar autocratic political systems, do not get along personally, Russian political analysts say. Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, president of Belarus, and Vladimir V. Putin, president of Russia, by most accounts detest each another. Their feelings have spilled over into the fertilizer business.        
The potash problem reached a peak on July 30, when Uralkali, the Russian potash company, announced it was withdrawing from an international cartel called the Belarusian Potash Company, or B.P.C., which was created to keep prices high.        
Two marketing groups, B.P.C. in the former Soviet Union and Canpotex in Canada, sell nearly all the potash in the world. B.P.C. marketed fertilizer for Uralkali and Belaruskali, the Belarussian company, and Canpotex for three Canadian producers, the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Mosaic and Agrium.        
For years, potash companies have kept a thumb on the global trade of this critical plant nutrient, choking back supply to raise prices much as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries does with oil or De Beers with diamonds. The two cartels set nearly identical prices for potash worldwide, preventing farmers from benefiting from competition.        
Uralkali said it was leaving B.P.C. because the Belarus president had been allowing fertilizer sales on the side. It predicted potash prices would drop about 25 percent, to $300 a ton, from around $400 a ton, when it left. The lower prices would hurt Russia, but they would hurt Belarus more.        
Though Uralkali denies any direct link, this action came after years of efforts by Mr. Putin and the Kremlin to compel Belarus to sell strategic assets like oil refineries and natural gas pipelines, in exchange for subsidized energy supplies.        
Mr. Lukashenko first agreed to sell a stake in Belaruskali, though the potash mine provides about 10 percent of the state tax revenue, but then balked. He said it was still for sale, but cited an exorbitantly high price, angering the Russian oligarchs who had been vying for it, and setting the stage for the breakup of the fertilizer cartel that followed.        
The Belarussian government retaliated with what appeared to be a trap: the Belarussian prime minister invited the chief executive of Uralkali, Vladislav Baumgertner, to his country for talks on Aug. 26, and then arrested him at the airport. Uralkali’s chairman, Aleksandr Voloshin, and a part owner, Suleyman Kerimov, had also been invited, but only Mr. Baumgertner showed up.        
It was unclear whether the others stayed clear of Belarus because they had sensed a trap, or whether their schedules simply did not have room for the country’s prime minister, which was the formal explanation both officials offered.        
Mr. Baumgertner was charged with “abuse of power,” which carries a potential 10-year sentence. Belarus state television showed his glum perp walk past the water-stained concrete walls of a prison nicknamed “the American girl,” led by a chubby guard in a camouflage uniform.        
Belaruskali, which is state-owned, has no public relations office. The switchboard referred calls to Anatoly V. Makhlai, whose title is deputy director for ideology and cadres, who declined to comment.        
Later, the Belarussian authorities issued arrest warrants for four other executives and Mr. Kerimov, the part owner. Analysts say Mr. Baumgertner is not likely to serve hard time but is instead being held as a hostage to compel the Russians to rejoin the cartel.        
Outraged, the Russians responded with a flurry of trade restrictions, banning all Belarussian pork imports, ostensibly over newly discovered health concerns.        
“It looks like the conflict is escalating,” Boris Krasnojenov, a mining analyst at Renaissance Capital, an investment bank based in Moscow, confirmed in an interview.        
Farmers and fertilizer companies are watching closely. Shares in the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan rose earlier this week after signs of a reconciliation.        
Reports indicated Mr. Kerimov would sell his stake to another Russian oligarch more palatable to President Lukashenko or to the nickel mining company Norilsk, leading to a patching up of ties and re-creation of the price-fixing cartel. But Norilsk said on Wednesday that it had no plans to buy a stake. Shares in Potash Corporation fell again.        
Even by the standards of business practices in the former Soviet Union, these tactics appeared blunt. “This move is absolutely aggressive and abnormal,” Mr. Krasnojenov said, referring to the arrest of Mr. Baumgertner. “The prime minister invited the C.E.O. of a major company to a meeting and then arrested him.”        
The dispute has hurt profits of both Uralkali and its former Belarussian partner, Belaruskali — and been wonderful for farmers from Idaho to India who have already benefited from lower fertilizer prices. Potash is one of three main plant nutrients, along with phosphate and nitrogen, and is used widely to increase corn and soybean yields.        
The price for granular potash in the Midwest has fallen to around $400 a ton, from $420 before the announcement on July 30.        
“Optimists say that every cloud has a silver lining,” Ed Lotterman, a columnist for The Idaho Statesman, wrote of the wobbling cartel. “It isn’t hard to find one in the recent potash industry upheaval that sent the stock of several fertilizer producers down by a fourth. What is bad for them is great news for U.S. farmers.”

Power chords and pizzicato. Cha-cha and chamber music. Funk and free jazz. Klezmer and cacophony. All of those, and many more, turned up during a marathon of John Zorn’s Masada works at the N.Y.U. Skirball Center on Sunday.        


In four and a half hours of music by 13 ensembles and soloists, the concert celebrated Mr. Zorn’s 60th birthday, which was Sept. 2. He has been marking the occasion with concerts around the world that have reaffirmed his astonishing productivity and multifarious connections. Mr. Zorn was sampling and mashing up idioms long before computers made it easy; he was also, well before the Internet, setting up improbable but fruitful networks of musicians and ideas.        
The concert drew on a fraction of Mr. Zorn’s Masada repertory: two sets of melodies, the first 200 of them from the 1990s and another 316 tunes he wrote in three months in 2004. (Nearly all of the program came from the second group, “The Book of Angels.”) The Masada pieces are based in klezmer, with its modal scales, odd meters and zigzagging melodies. And like klezmer itself — a fusion of what Jewish musicians brought with them and picked up in travels through Eastern Europe and then America — the tunes are flexible.        
They were brittle, perpetual-motion jazz in Uri Caine’s piano solos; blistering psychedelic jams — powered by bass riffs plucked on a Moroccan gimbri — in the hands of Abraxas; and sleek bachelor-pad music as played by Bar Kokhba. Krakauer set David Krakauer’s clarinet wailing over funk vamps. Mycale, a four-woman a cappella group, turned them into intricate, ingenious, glowing pan-Mediterranean songs.        
Much of Mr. Zorn’s music revolves around the idea of genres, investigating how they’re recognized, how they connect or contrast, how far they can be stretched, how they can be juxtaposed or intercut. He approaches genres as a connoisseur, a strategist, a trickster and sometimes a vandal; if a genre is seen as a set of rules, he might play by them, toy with them or tear them apart. Behind the musical elements are the associations of genres with eras, places and people; his music pulls free of them.        
Erik Friedlander turned Masada tunes into impassioned cello solos recalling the techniques of Bach suites. Malphas, the duo of Mark Feldman on violin and Sylvie Courvoisier on piano, played them as splintered chamber music: a series of brief, precise, suddenly contrasting passages lasting only a few seconds each. The Roberto Rodriguez Octeto Masada mingled klezmer with Latin charanga, and invited the audience to dance. The Masada String Trio gave its tunes a hint of Gypsy music. Dreamers cast the melodies as smoothly shimmering jazz. Cyro Baptista’s Banquet of the Spirits charged into one melody as a kind of Middle Eastern surf-rock, and Secret Chiefs 3 cranked its tunes up to burly jazz-rock with klezmer violin interludes.        
Electric Masada, with Mr. Zorn on alto saxophone, had the last set, and it was a gleeful, eventful one, moving amid hurtling electric jazz, eerie laptop electronics and squalls of percussion and dissonance, cued on the spot by Mr. Zorn. And all through the marathon, a paradox persisted. With all the transformations and idioms, the Masada tunes held on to some klezmer identity: one stubborn genre indeed.        



 
John Zorn returns on Sept. 28 with a daylong, multi-ensemble event at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. (212) 535-7710; metmuseum.org.

TO THE EDITOR:        
Re “The Penicillin Superstition” (Hard Cases, Sept. 10): An allergist can be called in to determine if the patient is allergic to penicillin and to direct a desensitization process if the patient is allergic when there is no satisfactory alternative drug. A recent study indicated that appropriate testing for penicillin allergy (by allergy consultants) would significantly lower medical costs by finding patients not needing penicillin alternatives.        
The most important concern, however, is not to harm the patient by giving penicillin and finding out the patient was correct about the allergy and is now having a severe and potentially fatal allergic reaction. Penicillin testing can avoid that tragic scenario.

                            It seems obvious that a comedy about a mother-and-daughter team of recovering addicts would be harder-edged than one about meddling elderly fathers who won’t pick up a check.        


                            Actually, “Mom,” which begins next Monday on CBS, is, for some reason, both wittier and sweeter than the new Fox show “Dads,” which has its premiere on Tuesday.        

                            It’s not the casting, although “Mom” has a slight edge, with Allison Janney as Bonnie, and Anna Faris as her daughter, Christy. But still, “Dads” has its share of experienced comic actors, including Martin Mull as the father of Warner (Giovanni Ribisi), and Peter Riegert as the father of Eli (Seth Green).        

                            Mostly, it’s the sensibility behind the writing.        

                            Chuck Lorre, a creator of “Mom,” is known, among other things, for “Two and a Half Men” and “The Big Bang Theory.” Those hit comedies ostensibly revolve around immature men, but they are even more distinctive for their funny, uncommon female characters, notably Amy on “Big Bang,” played by Mayim Bialik.        

                            “Dads” has many executive producers, including Seth MacFarlane, a creator of “Family Guy.” It turns out that the willfully sophomoric, politically incorrect humor that works in an animated series doesn’t sound as amusing when coming out of the mouths of flesh-and-blood actors. There are some funny lines, but not nearly enough. Material that is meant to be anarchic mostly comes across as obvious and boorish.        

                            “Mom” is more genuinely provocative. Bonnie is an irrepressibly cheery and unapologetic former addict who cannot understand why her grown daughter is still so resentful. “I’ve watched you lick cocaine crumbs out of a shag carpet,” Christy says. Bonnie replies primly, “It’s not a sin to be thrifty, Dear.”        

                            It helps that cable has already laid the groundwork for the flawed mother figure.        

                            Shows like “The Sopranos” and “Breaking Bad” gave rise to the era of so-called “difficult men,” but cable has also radically loosened the restrictions on heroines. Homemakers are rule breakers, from the suburban pot dealer on “Weeds” to the substance-abusing title character of “Nurse Jackie.” It used to be that sitcom characters complained that their mom was crazy because she had too many hats: on “The United States of Tara,” Toni Collette played a wife and mother with multiple personalities.        

                            Moms behaving badly aren’t a new thing, but on a prime-time show, it still feels a little transgressive. Men who act like boys, on the other hand, are so familiar that they’re almost retro. And that makes “Dads” a harder sell. Eli and Warner, best friends since childhood, have a thriving video game business aided by a small team of employees and mostly impeded by their clueless, interfering fathers. The characters are caricatures, and the jokes are often unpleasant.        

                            Eli is whiny and unprepossessing, yet he has a revolving door of attractive women eager to be his girlfriend. When a pretty aspirant arrives for a party, she perkily says, “You must be Warner!” as he opens the door. “Yeah, don’t learn my name, it’s easier that way,” Warner replies.        

                            The pilot of “Dads” caused a bit of a stir about stereotypes, and some advocacy groups were particularly offended when the Chinese-American employee, Veronica (Brenda Song), is instructed by Eli and Warner to dress up as a Sailor Moon-like animé character to soften up Chinese investors. Veronica, supposedly brainy, tough and confident, complies.        

                            Mostly, the show suffers from a more diffuse lack of imagination: all the women — wives, co-workers and even cleaning ladies — are castrating scolds with little sense of humor. Eli and Warner are man-boys, and their fathers are gomer-boys.        

                            “Mom,” which focuses on women in recovery, has a get-straight message, which may merely be a reflection of Mr. Lorre’s rather sobering experience dealing with Charlie Sheen at the height of that actor’s substance-infused public meltdown.        

                            Like many shows today, “Dads” is far more cavalier about marijuana use. In the second episode, Warner and Veronica put Eli through an intervention to persuade him to go back on pot because they think he is more creative when he’s stoned. The dads end up consuming the pot-laced brownies: hilarity does not ensue.        

                            “Mom” deals lightly with the serious problem of addiction and manages to be clever, not sanctimonious. “Dads” takes a minor problem — annoying parents — and makes it deadly.

“Kafkaesque” is not a word normally used to describe immune responses, but it’s how Dr. Louis J. Picker described what his experimental vaccine did to his rhesus monkeys: “It’s like their T-cells were turned into the East German secret police, hunting down infected cells until there were none left.”        


Recent work by Dr. Picker, a vaccine expert at Oregon Health & Science University, has shaken up the long, frustrating search for an AIDS vaccine. His latest study, published in Nature last week, has scientists scratching their heads, wondering if it might open up a new avenue for research.        
Dr. Picker tested his vaccine in 16 monkeys who were then infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, a close relative of H.I.V., which normally would have sent them spiraling rapidly down to a miserable death. The experimental vaccine protected only nine of them, but it also did something never seen before: these monkeys slowly “cleared” the virus and now appear to be cured. “Three years later, you can’t tell them from other monkeys,” Dr. Picker said.        
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the effect was “unique.”        
And Dr. Barton F. Haynes, the director of the Human Vaccine Institute at Duke University’s medical school, said it was “potentially extremely important to understand how this happened.”        
Scientists often test ideas for potential AIDS vaccines by creating similar ones against S.I.V. Never before has one eliminated an existing infection. In that sense, the effect of Dr. Picker’s vaccine was less like that of a measles or flu shot and more like that of the AIDS cures used in two famous cases, known as the Berlin patient and the Mississippi baby.        
The Berlin patient, Timothy Ray Brown, was infected with H.I.V. and cured only by obliterating his immune system to defeat his leukemia, and then injecting bone marrow from a donor with a rare H.I.V.-blocking mutation. The unidentified baby was born to an infected mother in Mississippi and apparently infected with H.I.V., but then cured with early and large doses of antiretroviral drugs.        
Both now appear to have no H.I.V. lurking deep in their bodies, but it is impossible to be sure because not every bit of their tissue can be tested.        
Because he works with monkeys, Dr. Picker was able to do something that would be unthinkable with human patients — necropsy them, grind up every organ and take 240 samples from each to be sure that they harbored no hidden virus.        
Making vaccines by simply weakening the virus that causes AIDS has failed because the virus mutates a hundred times faster than even the fast-mutating flu virus. In Dr. Picker’s vaccine, S.I.V. genes are fused to those of another virus, the cytomegalovirus. (The name means “big cell,” and it is in the herpes family but different from its relatives that cause lip and genital sores, chickenpox and shingles.)        
H.I.V. fusion has been tried with adenoviruses and others, but cytomegalovirus seems to work better. It’s not entirely clear why, but one theory is that cytomegalovirus has a very long history of infecting primates — so much so that 100 percent of monkeys and about 80 percent of humans get it in their lifetimes.        
Therefore, we primates have adapted to it. Although the virus can be lethal to fetuses and to those with immune systems suppressed by AIDS or transplant drugs, in most victims it causes no symptoms.        
The body responds to cytomegalovirus more slowly and calmly than it does, for example, to a flu.        
As in any infection, the thymus gland generates new white blood cells called T cells — in this case, CD8 hunter-killer cells — primed to target the specific virus. But in the case of Dr. Picker’s vaccine, those cells stay in an unusual “half-alert” state. A full-blown immune response eventually exhausts itself, and can even be dangerous. For example, the rare humans who catch H5N1 bird flu often die of the immune response itself; they drown in the flood of CD8s and other would-be saviors pouring into the lung tissue, spoiling for a fight.        
That “half-alert” state is the “Kafkaesque” element: unactivated CD8s wander around aimlessly, while fully activated ones behave like storm troopers. But the half-activated CD8s persist in tissues, eliminating their targets quietly without triggering inflammation or even a mild fever.        
When S.I.V. genes are fused to the cytomegalovirus spine, the CD8s kill S.I.V.-infected cells too.        
Since it protected only some monkeys, the new technique might be best used in combination approaches. For example, Dr. Fauci said, it could be given with a vaccine that generates antibodies against H.I.V. “and maybe eliminate the cells that sneak past the antibody shield.”        
Alternatively, the vaccine might be given to infected patients who are on antiretroviral drugs to see if it can “mop up” lingering reservoirs of virus.        
It should take up to three years to get a human version ready for trials, Dr. Picker estimated.        
“Now the outstanding question is, ‘Why only half?’ ” said Dr. Mike McCune, an AIDS researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, referring to the monkeys who were protected in Dr. Picker’s trial.        
Too often, AIDS advances that work in lots of monkeys don’t work in many humans.        
“Not all monkeys are the same,” Dr. McCune said. “They’re not as inbred as mice, but they’re sometimes from the same families, they get the same diets... Who knows what will happen if this goes into humans?”

WASHINGTON — Factory output surged in August as the pace of motor vehicle production jumped to a six-year high, a hopeful sign for the economy after a slow start to the third quarter.        


Although another report on Monday showed a slight slowdown in factory activity in New York State this month, new orders and shipments in the state rose, all pointing to an increase in manufacturing after weakening in the spring.        
“Growth in the manufacturing sector is picking up and will run faster over the balance of the year than has been the case in recent months,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.        
Manufacturing production advanced 0.7 percent, the Federal Reserve said. The increase helped to lift overall industrial production by 0.4 percent in August.        
Factory output had lagged solid gains in the Institute for Supply Management’s index of manufacturing activity.        
“The sharp recovery in the I.S.M. since May followed now by this surge in manufacturing output are encouraging signs that the spring soft patch in factory activity is over,” said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley.        
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its Empire State general business conditions index slipped to 6.29 in September from 8.24 last month. A reading above zero indicates expansion.        
Even as activity in New York State slowed, businesses were confident about the future. The survey’s index of six-month business conditions approached a one-and-a-half-year high in September, a good sign for business spending.        
The improvement in industrial output last month pointed to some underlying momentum in factory activity, which supports economists’ forecasts of only a mild slowdown in economic growth this quarter.        
This momentum is likely to encourage the Federal Reserve to begin winding down its economic stimulus when its policy makers meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to assess the economy’s health.        
“The economy continues to expand at enough of a pace where we are creating jobs and helping to bring down the unemployment rate,” said Gus Faucher, senior economist at the PNC Financial Services Group. “I would not be surprised to see an announcement on Wednesday” that the Fed will begin reducing its $85 billion a month in purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.        
Gains in manufacturing output last month were led by a 5.2 percent rebound in auto production, which had slumped 4.5 percent in July. It was the largest increase since November and it took auto production to an 11.25 million-unit annual rate, the highest since June 2007.        
There were also increases in the production of consumer goods, high-tech equipment, machinery, aerospace and electrical equipment and appliances.        
Utilities output fell for a fifth consecutive month in August, a decline economists attributed to a relatively cool summer and difficulties adjusting the series for seasonal fluctuations.        
The amount of industrial capacity in use crept up to 77.8 percent, from 77.6 percent in July. Capacity use, which can indicate how much factories can increase production before economic growth becomes inflationary, is still 2.4 percentage points below its long-run average.        
“There is no evidence of any inflation pressure at this point in the production cycle,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at Deutsche Bank.

                            Have you ever heard about the American pilot who took off from an aircraft carrier on Dec. 7, 1941, for a routine check of its next port, Pearl Harbor? His last words were a desperate “Hold your fire” message, just before he was shot down — no one is sure by which side — as one of the first American casualties of World War II. That was Ensign Manuel Gonzales, as viewers will learn through “Latino Americans,” an important and enlightening three-part, six-hour PBS documentary that begins on Tuesday night.        


                            Then there was the soldier who in 1836 shouted, “Remember the Alamo!” and led a regiment in Sam Houston’s Republic of Texas Army to victory over Santa Anna’s Mexican forces. You know: Juan Seguín. And the World War II hero who won the Silver Star for capturing 1,500 Japanese prisoners of war. That was Guy Gabaldon, a Mexican-American who, in the movie about his exploits (“Hell to Eternity,” 1960), was played by the blue-eyed Jeffrey Hunter.        

                            For those who sometimes imagine that Latinos arrived in the United States in the 1950s, just in time to audition for “West Side Story,” it is a particular revelation that Latino American history goes back quite a bit further and has been, to a distressing degree, Anglo-washed. The documentary’s story moves along quickly, though: by the third hour, Dr. Hector Garcia is working with the Johnson administration in the 1960s.        

                            “Latino Americans” is the kind of polished, intelligent documentary series that PBS does so well. The format is a traditional one now, with vintage film clips, zooms and pans of old paintings and photographs, and an assortment of thoughtful talking heads. But this time, those heads belong to historians named García, Montejano and Ruiz; political organizers named Gutierrez, Velásquez and Esparza; academics named Padrón; and journalists named Suárez and Salinas. Adriana Bosch, the documentary’s Emmy Award-winning producer, moved to the United States from Cuba in 1970.        

                            Most of the time, we meet the successful adults — like the actress-singer-dancer Rita Moreno, whose acceptance of her Oscar in 1962 we see at least three times — and then are familiarized with their backgrounds. Ms. Moreno was born in Puerto Rico and moved to New York with her mother when she was 5. In one case, though, we hear about an activist’s early years first. In 1946 a Navy war veteran everyone called C. C. desegregated a movie theater in Delano, Calif., just by taking a seat one night in the middle section with the Anglos. After this story, we learn that C. C. was Cesar Chavez.        

                            By the middle of the 21st century, there are expected to be about 127 million Latino-Americans, nearly 30 percent of the projected United States population. Some Latinos see today as “the Hispanic moment” and urge that opportunities be seized now or lost.        

                            The second and third parts of “Latino Americans,” whose subjects include Chavez, the Chicano movement, the Dominican Republic, Central America, the battles against bilingualism and the Mariel boat lift, will be shown next Tuesday and on Oct. 1.

Science,"










The famous Nobel-winning scientist, Marie Curie, once said: “A scientist in his laboratory is not only a technician: he is also a child placed before natural phenomena which impress him like a fairy tale.”        


Casey Dunn is just trying to bring a little bit of that fairy tale back to science.        
A Brown University scientist, Dr. Dunn has added animation director to his list of titles over the last four years. In 2009, with money from the National Science Foundation for an audio podcast project, Dr. Dunn was convinced by a student — and a squid — to create animations instead. That student, Sophia Tintori, was working on a project on the squid’s very changeable colors. Once Dr. Dunn saw what she created, he said there was no turning back.        
“A lot of scientists come to science in first place because they find science beautiful; they find themselves mesmerized by looking at the stars or watching organisms or the imagery of the deep sea,” he said.        
As you watch the colorful crepe paper drama unfold in CreatureCast, you just might be mesmerized, too. A small army of student animators, most without previous experience, have taken viewers everywhere from to the bottom of the ocean, to see how the solitary angler fish finds and keeps a mate, to the tree tops, to find the strangler fig making trees hollow from the outside in.        
Dr. Dunn believes that the benefit of these small, endearingly imperfect films — created from pencil, paper, crayon and even cut up issues of National Geographic — extends well beyond his classroom. By training the aesthetic appreciation into students in the early days of their scientific careers he is preserving that sense of mesmerized beauty they came to science for. He is also helping them learn how to share it with the rest of us.        
CreatureCast will appear periodically at nytimes.com/creaturecast. Here, Casey Dunn introduces the newest episode: “Sex in Spoonworms.”        By Alysse AustinWhat if you had a tiny husband, about the size of a breath mint, that lived in a chamber within your body and produced sperm on an as-needed basis? This is how mating works in the green spoonworm. "

                            Andy Samberg and Andre Braugher, man-child and man’s man, make their debuts as sitcom leads in Fox’s new cop comedy, “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” on Tuesday night. That the show isn’t nearly as distinctive as its two stars is a disappointment, but, in a way, it’s also a virtue. Mild, affable and familiar, “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” is a show the whole family can snicker at.        


                            And there’s something to be said for that in a season when most of the other new sitcoms are self-conscious star vehicles (“The Crazy Ones,” “The Michael J. Fox Show”), portraits of family dysfunction (“Mom,” “The Millers”) or salutes to unchecked testosterone (“Dads,” “We Are Men”). In that context, a loose, jokey workplace comedy looks like a relief.        

                            The throwback feel of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” is built into the premise. It belongs to a narrow genre, the squad room sitcom, whose most notable example remains the 1970s classic “Barney Miller.” And the relationship between Mr. Samberg’s Detective Jake Peralta and Mr. Braugher’s Capt. Ray Holt stems from an even older and more celebrated show: they’re a modern, manscaped version of Hawkeye Pierce and Colonel Potter in “M*A*S*H.”        

                            Not that you want to think about that comparison for more than a second. Like Pierce, Peralta is both anti-establishment and supercompetent: he organizes fire extinguisher races and refuses to wear a tie but he’s also, we’re told, the best detective in the precinct. Unlike Pierce, he doesn’t have a serious edge or an excuse (artillery fire, incessant carnage) for his manic immaturity, beyond being the central character in a 21st-century sitcom.        

                            And despite its fond associations, “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” — created by Dan Goor and Michael Schur, who were writers and producers on “Parks and Recreation” — is thoroughly contemporary in its sketch-comedy-style structure, emphasizing throwaway jokes, physical humor and visual punch lines (like an amusing “Mod Squad” reference) while avoiding anything resembling story development.        

                            Crimes are solved in the pilot episode, but you won’t remember who did what, or why. You’ll remember that Andy Samberg tied a tie around his waist and wore a psychedelic Speedo, and that deli meats and cheeses were thrown, leading someone to yell, “That’s a waste of manchego!,” and that Andre Braugher said, “It’s over, Disco Man; put down the yo-yo and back away from the girl” in his voice-of-God baritone.        

                            Whether “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” will be consistently humorous enough to warrant attention is debatable from the pilot — it’s not great that the hoary “he’s right behind me, isn’t he?” gag is used several times, or that the funniest thing in the episode is a nearly silent 26-second cameo by Fred Armisen.        

                            It should continue to score well in likability, though. Mr. Braugher shows that deadpan humor is a solid component of his formidable arsenal, and Mr. Samberg is charming and nicely self-effacing. In the supporting cast of cops, Joe Lo Truglio and Stephanie Beatriz stand out as the well-meaning klutz and the scary-tough cookie. Like “Parks and Recreation” or even “Barney Miller,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” could — just possibly — grow into something greater than the sum of its quirks.

Chinese food has been popular since Americans started going out to dinner, but cooking it at home has never quite caught on — maybe because so many Americanized Chinese restaurants still serve sweet-and-sticky or deep-fried dishes (I’m looking at you, General Tso’s chicken) that don’t seem like good weeknight choices.        
Enter Fuchsia Dunlop, a British journalist who has done more to explain real Chinese cooking to non-Chinese cooks than anyone. (It all started in the mid-1990s, when she enrolled in cooking school in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, more to improve her language skills than with the expectation of becoming a skilled cook.)        
Her latest cookbook, “Every Grain of Rice,” is about simple, everyday Chinese cooking, leaving no more room for excuses from American home cooks. Anyone can buy a bamboo steamer online, and tofu is available at nearly every supermarket in the country. Frankly, there isn’t a faster or more healthful way of organizing weeknight dinners. (And we are not just talking about stir-fries.)        
The recipes in this book are authentic, gathered from Ms. Dunlop’s travels around China, and were chosen to suit modern home cooks.        
We’re going to make gong bao chicken, a pop classic with hot chiles, crunchy peanuts and plenty of garlic and ginger. Then Ms. Dunlop will join me and three Dining readers in a live video chat to discuss the recipe and Chinese cooking at home.        
“Everyone loves it, and it’s complex enough to be interesting without being too complicated to make,” Ms. Dunlop said of the gong bao chicken. “Plenty to talk about.” We look forward to it.        
Gong Bao Chicken With Peanuts 
Adapted from “Every Grain of Rice: Simple Chinese Home Cooking,” by Fuchsia Dunlop (W.W. Norton & Company, 2013)  
Time: 40 minutes  
Yield: 2 to 3 servings 
For the chicken: 
2 boneless chicken breasts (11 to 12 ounces total), with or without skin        
3 garlic cloves        
An equivalent amount of ginger        
5 spring onions, white parts only        
A handful of dried chiles (about 10)        
2 tablespoons cooking oil        
1 teaspoon whole Sichuan pepper        
3 ounces (75 grams) roasted peanuts (see note)        
For the marinade:  
1/2 teaspoon salt        
2 teaspoons light soy sauce        
1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine (or use dry sherry or dry vermouth)        
1 1/2 teaspoons potato starch or cornstarch        
For the sauce: 
1 tablespoon sugar        
3/4 teaspoon potato starch or cornstarch        
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce        
1 teaspoon light soy sauce        
1 tablespoon Chinkiang vinegar (or use balsamic vinegar)        
1 teaspoon sesame oil        
1 tablespoon chicken stock or water        
1. Cut chicken as evenly as possible into half-inch strips, then cut strips into small cubes. Place in a small bowl. Add marinade ingredients and 1 tablespoon water to bowl. Mix well and set aside.        
2. Peel and thinly slice garlic and ginger. Chop spring onions into chunks as long as their diameter (to match the chicken cubes). Snip chiles in half or into sections, discarding their seeds.        
3. In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients.        
4. Heat a seasoned wok over a high flame. Add oil, chiles and Sichuan pepper and stir-fry briefly until chiles are darkening but not burned. (Remove wok from heat if necessary to prevent overheating.)        
5. Quickly add chicken and stir-fry over a high flame, stirring constantly. As soon as chicken cubes have separated, add ginger, garlic and spring onions and continue to stir-fry until they are fragrant and meat is just cooked through (test one of the larger pieces to make sure).        
6. Give sauce a stir and add to wok, continuing to stir and toss. As soon as the sauce has become thick and shiny, add the peanuts, stir them in and serve.        
Note: Store-bought roasted peanuts work well here, but if you want to roast your own peanuts, heat oven to 250 degrees. Place raw nuts on an oven tray and roast for 15 to 20 minutes, until fragrant and very slightly golden. (Keep an eye on them, as they are easily burned.) Cool nuts on a plate, then rub nuts between your fingertips to loosen their skins. Shake nuts as you blow over them; skins will blow away.

                            Mrs. Clandon is the very model of an independent 21st-century woman. Too bad she lives at the turn of the 20th century.        


                            To the shock of Victorian society, Mrs. Clandon (Robin Leslie Brown) abruptly fled her unhappy marriage in England for the lush exotica of a Portuguese island. There she created a new life for herself (and her three children) by writing “Twentieth Century Treatises,” a best-selling series of manifestoes on parenting, cooking, conduct, clothing and, of course, gender relations, which her carefully indoctrinated offspring frequently quote back to her.        

                            That’s the back story for George Bernard Shaw’s “You Never Can Tell,” a subversive comedy of errors about men and women’s negotiations over independence and marriage.        

                            When the play opens, the Clandon clan has returned home to England after 18 years of island living. The younger children (twins played by Emma Wisniewski and Ben Charles, a voluble and perfectly synced Tweedledee and Tweedledum) soon unknowingly invite their father to a family lunch. But while the estranged spouses quarrel, a reluctant romance blossoms between the eldest Clandon child (a frequently flushed Amelia Pedlow) and a penniless dentist (Sean McNall), neither of whom are prepared for sentimentality’s steel-trap grip on their scientifically honed minds.        

                            For better or for worse, their abrasive, overly intellectualized courtship translates easily to today’s battle of the sexes. But much of what was so revolutionary and outrageous about Shaw’s plot twists and inversions of Victorian mores is lost in this production, directed by David Staller. In particular, the scene transitions — in which the twins waltz around the stage and blow some sort of fairy dust upon various light fixtures — feel like forced whimsy. Touches like this and other strained physical comedy gum up the pacing and blunt the sharp social commentary that Mr. Staller celebrates in the program notes.        

                            While this Pearl Theater Company revival may not deliver the sociopolitical punch that Shaw intended, it is still brightened by some strong performances, particularly those of Dan Daily as a wizened waiter and Zachary Spicer as his son, a smug barrister who has embarrassed his servant-class father by rising above his social status.

                            It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a play as brutal as “Carcass.” It may be even longer before I can scrub its residue from my mind. Severe and unrelentingly grim, the piece is often difficult to watch; several audience members flinched during its most vicious moments. Yet “Carcass” is also tough to look away from, especially in this cunning production that intensifies every angry scene.        


                            Written around 1905 by Peretz Hirshbein, the story centers on an embittered family, led by Avrush, its alcoholic patriarch. Mend’l, his slow-witted son, seethes over his own misfortunes and unrequited love, while Reyz’l, Avrush’s stepdaughter, dreams of better days. Such hopes are no doubt futile, and any flickers of tenderness are extinguished immediately.        

                            The script, translated from Yiddish by Ellen Perecman, is reminiscent of Büchner’s “Woyzeck” and the most pessimistic plays of Strindberg. (It is presented here by New Worlds Theater Project, which specializes in English adaptations of Yiddish theater.) The dialogue is steeped in threatening language and violent imagery. “Spit in her face!” Mend’l demands that Reyz’l do to her mother. “I hope you die a painful death,” he rages at his own, who is ill.        

                            This Expressionistic staging, directed by Paul Takacs, adds to the menace — the set (by Steven C. Kemp) is stark and claustrophobic, the sound design (by Jeremy S. Bloom) eerie and pervasive. Colors are washed-out and shadows creep into every corner (the lighting is by Dante Olivia Smith). It’s no surprise that the program features a work by Egon Schiele.        

                            As Avrush, David Greenspan’s bile seeps into every sentence. He’s an oily defeatist, wallowing in misery. Alvin Keith’s Mend’l is a caged, beaten creature, sometimes attacking those around him, sometimes shying away. Mr. Keith is a fearsome, involved actor. Rebekah Levin’s Reyz’l smoothly alternates between innocence and anxiety. Thomas Preece, Kathryn Rossetter and Robyn Kerr round out the cast of six, none of whom shrink from their characters’ fury.        

“Carcass” is certainly not for the casual theatergoer. But this rarely performed, 70-minute work offers dark rewards for those who can stomach its depictions of physical and psychological cruelty. Make no mistake — the play is never fun. But it’s almost always fascinating.

“The Lighthouse is a worldwide household name in terms of vision services, and the Guild has highly developed models within health care,” said Dr. Alan R. Morse, who is the president and chief executive of Jewish Guild Healthcare and will have the same title in the new organization. “Both of our programs will benefit from each other.”        
Joseph A. Ripp, who is the chairman of Lighthouse International and will be the vice chairman of the combined organization, said it could “raise the profile of vision loss,” just as organizations that concentrate on heart disease and kidney disease have done for those illnesses.        
“What’s happening is as the population ages, macular degeneration is becoming a serious issue for America,” Mr. Ripp said. “The good news is we’re living longer. The bad news is we’re most likely to have vision issues as we get older.” Dr. Morse has long warned that diabetes and accompanying vision loss are increasing.        
Dr. Morse and the president and chief executive of Lighthouse International, Mark G. Ackermann, said that for now, the two operations would remain separate and at their current addresses. Jewish Guild Healthcare has its headquarters on West 65th Street near Central Park and runs five adult health day care centers around New York State. Lighthouse International, based on East 59th Street near Park Avenue, specializes in low-vision rehabilitation and social services, and runs a music school.        
Mr. Ackermann, who will be the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Lighthouse Guild International once the merger is completed early next year, said the combination “rounds out the services that the Lighthouse has and enables us to expand our treatment of the whole person” with the mental health services the Guild offers. All 41 members of the boards of the two organizations will have seats on the board of Lighthouse Guild International.        
The chairman will be James M. Dubin, who is now the chairman of Jewish Guild Healthcare. He said the combined organization could have a stronger voice in advocating programs for the blind like the Guild’s long-term managed-care operation, which is financed with federal Medicaid money that is allocated by the state.        
“If there’s a 2 percent cut, which there was a year and a half ago, our goal is to provide the same kind of service and do it with less funding from the state,” Mr. Dubin said. “We have to be cognizant of what’s going on in Washington and Albany, and so does the Lighthouse.”        
Jewish Guild Healthcare was founded in 1914 as the New York Guild for the Jewish Blind; it changed its name to the Jewish Guild for the Blind in 1960, then to Jewish Guild Healthcare in 2012. Lighthouse International was founded in 1905 as the New York Association for the Blind.        
“Lighthouse International has a great name,” Mr. Dubin said, adding that there are 30 local groups around the country whose names include the word “lighthouse,” none affiliated with the one in New York. “We are hoping to reach out and start some national affiliation. My guess is if we can affiliate with Lighthouse in Chicago, Dallas, wherever, we’ll learn from them just as they can learn from us.”        
Mr. Ackermann, who became the top official at the Lighthouse four years ago, said he and Dr. Morse began talking about joining forces several months ago. Dr. Morse has worked on research papers with Dr. Bruce Rosenthal, who leads the low-vision clinic at the Lighthouse.        
“Our staff cooperates all the time,” Dr. Morse said, “but it’s been on a casual, ad hoc basis, nothing institutional. There are linkages between the Guild and the Lighthouse and the Lighthouse and the Guild on many levels. Their teachers talk with our teachers, our rehabilitation professionals talk with theirs.”        
He said their discussions “evolved” through the summer. “Finally,” he said, “it was, ‘Why hadn’t we done this before?’ ”

Voyager 1 has left the solar system, while back on Earth, the tallest mountain in North America turns out to be a bit shorter. Also, there was news of gustatory trickery, in the form of Sichuan peppercorns; a climate surprise, in the refreezing of Arctic ice; and some competition for the entrepreneur Elon Musk in the world of commercial space exploration.        


Developments 
OUTER SPACE        
Decades After Launching, a First 
For the first time, something made by humans on Earth has entered interstellar space. Instruments aboard Voyager 1, launched by NASA back in 1977, observed a year ago that the wind of particles blowing out from the Sun had suddenly disappeared. That led some to conclude that it had left the solar system, but top mission scientists disagreed, because Voyager 1 did not observe an expected change in the magnetic field. Unfortunately, the instrument that could have directly answered the question broke in 1980. But then a barrage of particles from a solar eruption passed by Voyager, and that generated vibrations that could be detected by another instrument on the spacecraft. The data matched expectations for interstellar space.        
GEOLOGY        
Shorter, but Still the Tallest 
The tallest mountain in North America is a little shorter than previously thought. Mount McKinley in Alaska, also known as Denali, is 20,237 feet high, according to sophisticated radar measurements by the United States Geological Survey. That shaves 83 feet off the commonly published height of 20,320 feet, determined in 1952 from photographs. National Public Radio reports that McKinley remains ahead of No. 2: Mount Logan in Canada, a mere 19,550 feet high.        
FOOD SCIENCE        
The Tingle Is Only a Feeling 
Sichuan cuisine revolves around Sichuan peppercorns, which impart a numbing tingle on the tongue and lips. Researchers at University College London report that it is not taste receptors in the mouth that pick up the unusual culinary quality but rather nerve fibers that detect vibrations. In other words, the spice makes your lips feel as though they are vibrating rapidly, even though they are not. The researchers were even able to determine the frequency of the faux vibrations: about 50 times a second.        
CLIMATE        
The Arctic Ice’s Comeback 
Each year, the warmth of summer melts the Arctic sea ice, and as the earth warms, the ice has been shrinking. This summer, the Arctic ice bounced back — at the end of the melting season, it was 60 percent larger in extent than it was last year. That sounds like a giant change, but last year was a record low. In addition, satellite data shows that during the previous winter, the thickness of ice was a record low, further evidence that the long-term trend is still steadily downward. And the National Climatic Data Center reported last week that the United States this year experienced the 15th warmest summer on record — the coolest since 2009, although still 1.2 degrees above the 20th-century average.        
GENETICS        
DNA and the Way You Write 
Left-handed? It might be in your DNA. A team of researchers, mostly in Britain, had earlier found a correlation in dyslexia patients between a gene, PCSK6, and handedness. That was intriguing because PCSK6 is associated with left-right symmetry in the body. A Smithsonian blog reported that the researchers expanded their study to 2,600 people without dyslexia and found that the single gene could not fully explain handedness but that other genes, also associated with left-right symmetry, appeared to play a role.

LONDON — The vexing debate over the wearing of full-face veils in public has come to Britain, a country that prides itself on the protection of individual liberty.        


A judge in London decided Monday that a Muslim woman standing trial on charges of intimidating a witness can attend court wearing her facial veil, which covers everything but the eyes, but must remove it to give evidence so the jury can better evaluate her claims.        
That ruling comes a week after Birmingham Metropolitan College withdrew a ban on face coverings after protests and accusations of discrimination.        
Together the two cases suggest that it is becoming increasingly hard for the government to remain quiet about an issue that has already prompted legislation in continental Europe, most notably in France, which has the largest Muslim population in Europe.        
There, in the name of secularism and public order, and with bipartisan political support, full facial veils were banned in public places two years ago. France also bans the wearing of any religious symbols in state schools.        
There is no ban on wearing the veil in public in Britain, and government policy has allowed schools to make their own decisions on what students wear.        
In Britain, some members of Parliament and others beginning to push for a ban on wearing the facial veil, or niqab, in public places argue that they are protecting young women from domestic pressure to wear them, setting them apart from a more secular Western society; opponents see such laws as restrictions on personal and religious freedoms.        
So far the British government has tried to keep a distance from the issue but, in recent days, politicians have been challenged on their views.        
Speaking on Monday in Glasgow, Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said that Britain “shouldn’t end up like other countries issuing edicts from the center or laws from Parliament telling people what they should and shouldn’t wear. This is a free country and people going about their own business should be free to wear what they wish.”        
“I think it is very un-British to start telling people what pieces of clothing they should wear,” he added.        
Mr. Clegg then qualified his statement, however, saying that there are “exceptions to that as far as the full veil is concerned” — citing security checks at airports and classrooms, where teachers want to address pupils face-to-face.        
Earlier, Jeremy Browne, a Home Office minister, told The Telegraph newspaper that the subject was “a good topic for national debate” and that he is “instinctively uneasy about restricting the freedom of individuals to observe the religion of their choice.”        
“But there is genuine debate about whether girls should feel a compulsion to wear a veil when society deems children to be unable to express personal choices about other areas like buying alcohol, smoking or getting married,” Mr. Browne told the newspaper.        
“We should be very cautious about imposing religious conformity on a society which has always valued freedom of expression,” Mr. Browne added.        
A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday that the government supports the right of institutions like schools to set their own policies on uniforms and dress codes within the framework of laws that ban discrimination. But Mr. Cameron does not support the idea of a general ban, like the one in place in France, and there was no plan to redraft guidance to schools from the central government, he said.        
Critics of the wearing of the veil in public said the government’s policy of delegating decisions to the schools, which are often part of the communities affected, has been compromised by the perception that the college in Birmingham was pressured to reverse its ban. They have suggested that the school should have had more support from the government to implement its original decision.        
Last week Birmingham Metropolitan College said in a statement that it had opted to modify its policies “to allow individuals to wear specific items of personal clothing to reflect their cultural values.”        
“We have listened to the views of our students and we are confident that this modification to our policies will meet the needs of all of our learners and stakeholders,” it added.        
In Monday’s legal ruling, Judge Peter Murphy took steps to accommodate the defendant in the case, a 22-year-old London woman who cannot be named for legal reasons.        
She will be offered a screen to shield her from public view while giving evidence. But the judge said that her face had to be visible to him, the jury and lawyers.        
If she fails to comply with the order during the trial, she could be jailed for contempt of court.        
Talat Ahmed, chairwoman of the Muslim Council of Britain’s Social and Family Affairs Committee said in a statement that “recent events will once again generate controversy when in fact what we really need is sensible, nonhysterical conversation.”

TEHRAN — Internet users in Iran were surprised on Monday to find that they could access Facebook and Twitter without having to evade the government’s firewall, which had blocked direct access to the Web sites for years.        


It was not immediately clear whether the government had made an official decision to stop blocking the sites, which it walled off from Iranian users in 2009, saying they were being used by antigovernment protesters to organize demonstrations. To reach the sites, many Iranians began using virtual private network, or VPN, software to connect through computers located outside the country, though the telecommunications ministry eventually deployed technology to block much of that kind of traffic as well.        
The country’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, has promised several times to reduce Internet censorship, and several of his cabinet ministers, including the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, have set up Facebook pages and opened Twitter accounts, some of them quite active.        
Iranian Internet users reacted to the apparent unblocking on Monday as if a digital Berlin Wall had just crumbled on their computer screens.        
“Hurray, I came to Facebook without using VPN,” a user called Bita posted on her wall. “Thank you Rouhani!!!,” Nima wrote.        
In a twist of timing, an American Web-hosting company recently shut down the Web site of Mehdi Karroubi, an opposition leader who has been under house arrest since February 2011, to comply with United States sanctions that block hosting any site with the domain .ir, for Iran, Reuters reported Monday.        
In Iran, Internet censorship is the responsibility of the Supreme Council for Cyberspace, which has made millions of Web pages off limits for Iranians, including the Web site of The New York Times. A special police unit visits Internet users at home, especially in smaller cities, and warns them not to try to visit blocked sites.        
It was especially difficult to sidestep the firewall in June, around the time of the Iranian presidential election. In the days before the vote, supporters of the outgoing president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, fought for hours with officials at an Internet filtering center when several sites favoring Mr. Ahmadinejad were blocked.        
Several hard-line politicians have made public comments in recent days calling Facebook “a Zionist tool,” but the fact that it was accessible in Iran on Monday suggested that the censorship council, which Mr. Rouhani heads, might have decided otherwise.        
Still, the government has sometimes let the firewall blocking Facebook and Twitter slip open briefly by mistake, and some Iranians cautioned that the opening on Monday, too, might be just a glitch.

Citing concerns about drug quality, the Food and Drug Administration on Monday announced a ban on imports of any products made at the generic drug maker Ranbaxy’s newest factory in India.         
The move is the third time Ranbaxy imports have been blocked in the United States since 2008.        
The factory in Mohali, in the Punjab region of India, is not currently producing any products sold in the United States, according to the Food and Drug Administration.        
But the recently renovated facility was to be the centerpiece of Ranbaxy’s comeback from years of major manufacturing lapses, so the news that it, too, would now be prohibited from making drugs destined for the United States sent investors fleeing on Monday.        
Ranbaxy’s stock fell by 30 percent, to 318.5 rupees ($4.99), in Mumbai on Monday and financial analysts predicted the development could slow the introduction of several products, including the generic version of the best-selling blood pressure drug Diovan, which has already been delayed for a year. Ranbaxy is a subsidiary of the Japanese pharmaceutical company Daiichi Sankyo.        
The F.D.A. said it decided to issue the ban after agency inspectors uncovered significant manufacturing violations at the Mohali facility in September and December of last year. It said the company would be required to hire an outside expert to inspect the Mohali factory and certify that it met the agency’s standards before the restrictions were lifted.        
A spokesman for Ranbaxy declined to comment on Monday. Ranbaxy officials have said they are awaiting further details from the F.D.A.        
Ranbaxy has been operating under a federal consent decree with the F.D.A. since last year. In May, the company pleaded guilty to federal drug safety violations as part of a $500 million settlement that was the largest in history involving a generic manufacturer and drug safety. As part of the settlement, Ranbaxy admitted that it had failed to conduct proper safety and quality tests of drugs made at its Indian plants. Two other Ranbaxy plants have been operating under an import ban since 2008.        
In spring 2012, Ranbaxy began exporting generic Lipitor to the United States that was manufactured at Mohali, a facility the company said in a news release at the time was “equipped with the latest state-of-the-art technology.” But late last year, the company halted all production of generic Lipitor after tiny pieces of glass were found in the tablets. When sales resumed in March, the drug was being manufactured at the company’s Ohm Laboratories facility in New Jersey.        
Despite the Lipitor setback, some investors had held out hope that the company would make a comeback by selling exclusive copies of best-selling drugs, many of them manufactured at the Mohali facility.        
Several analysts speculated that the F.D.A’s action could further delay the debut of generic Diovan, a hypertension drug by Novartis that lost its patent protection one year ago. Ranbaxy has the exclusive right to sell the generic version of the drug for six months, but the F.D.A. has not given final approval. A competing generic company, Mylan, unsuccessfully sued the F.D.A. last year to force the agency to revoke Ranbaxy’s exclusive rights.        
Ranbaxy and the F.D.A. have not said where generic Diovan would be manufactured, but the analysts Nitin Agarwal and Param Desai of IDFC Securities in India said in a note Monday that the ban on the Mohali plant was likely to put further pressure on Ohm Laboratories, which they said was now Ranbaxy’s only manufacturing plant selling products to the United States market. “The facility is already running at full capacity,” they wrote in the note, in which they also downgraded the stock to underperform. “The alert on Mohali facility will hurt future approvals.”

THE largest agency holding group in advertising is seeking to revive its smallest agency network.        


The holding group, WPP, based in London, wants to bolster a collection of agencies known as the United Network, formed in 2006 from an agency network called Red Cell United. To that end, Matt Ryan, who most recently held senior posts at Havas Worldwide New York, is joining the United Network as its global chief executive, based in New York, to serve as a partner to Ewen Cameron, the longtime chairman of the United Network.        
The goal of the United Network — originally introduced under the name the Voluntary United Group of Creative Agencies — is to offer marketers an alternative, more creatively focused resource that is smaller than the four global agency networks also owned by WPP: Grey, JWT, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and Y&R.        
The idea behind a smaller agency network is that it can be more nimble, and its principals can pay more attention to each client. Also, not every marketer needs a giant agency with scores of offices around the world staffed by phalanxes of executives.        
“Part of our armory at WPP is to have networks with various structures and various appeals,” Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, said in a phone interview from Beijing, adding: “There’s a segment of the market where clients want smaller networks, micro-networks, mini-networks. It makes sense for us to have a network like this.”        
The United Network has counterparts at the other agency holding groups. Among them Bartle Bogle Hegarty at the Publicis Groupe and Lowe & Partners at the Interpublic Group of Companies. There are also a number of mini-networks that are independent, not part of a holding group, among them Gyro, M&C Saatchi and Wieden & Kennedy.        
The eight offices that make up the United Network are in London, Madrid, Milan, New York, Oslo, Paris, Seattle and Antwerp, Belgium. They work for blue-chip marketers like AstraZeneca, Capital One, Coca-Cola, Ikea, Procter & Gamble, Red Bull, Visa and Vodafone.        
But the United Network may be too small, even for a network meant not to be big. According to the trade publication Advertising Age, the United Network’s revenue last year totaled $80 million, compared with $105 million at Gyro, $202 million at Bartle Bogle Hegarty and $305 million at Lowe & Partners.        
“They are good individual agencies, good at what they do on an individual basis,” Mr. Sorrell said of the United Network offices, which include Berlin Cameron United in New York and Cole & Weber United in Seattle. The next step, he added, is “pulling the network together in a more cohesive way.”        
In June, Mr. Ryan, 52, left Havas Worldwide New York, part of the Havas Worldwide division of Havas, where he had been co-chairman as well as president for global brands. His departure came after Andrew Benett, the new global president of Havas Worldwide, took on added duties as chief executive of the New York office. Before Havas Worldwide New York, Mr. Ryan led, helped lead or held senior posts at agencies that included Change Technology Partners, Quintacom, Ryan Drossman & Partners and Ryan & Partners.        
“The first thing I’d say is that hiring Matt is a commitment by WPP and me to the idea of building United into what we wanted it to be from the beginning,” said Mr. Cameron, 49, acknowledging that the United Network had been “off the radar for a while.”        
Two reasons for that low profile, Mr. Cameron said, were “a focus on growing the clients we had” and “working with the WPP team process on projects.” His reference was to networks dedicated to specific WPP clients like Team Detroit, for Ford Motor, and Red Fuse, for Colgate-Palmolive.        
Such collaboration “keeps the agency viable,” Mr. Cameron said, “but the problem with that strategy is that it creates anonymity.”        
“To be a viable micro-network, I need a partner,” he added. “I’m better with partnership than on my own; I’m a planner by trade, not a C.E.O.” Mr. Cameron’s last partner, Andy Berlin, retired in 2008. Mr. Cameron said he was attracted to Mr. Ryan’s “experience in building global brands, building agencies.”        
Mr. Ryan said he believed that the United Network could use agencies in the Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe and Latin America regions, although he added, “It would be a big move if we went to 12 or 15” offices in total.        
Asked for a time frame for revitalizing the United Network, Mr. Ryan suggested it would be “12, 18, 24 months” before big returns would be obvious. Mr. Sorrell, asked the same question, replied, “As feasibly as possible and as quickly as possible.”        
Mr. Cameron said he began discussions with Mr. Sorrell to bring in a partner about six months ago, well before the announcement in late July that WPP would be displaced as the world’s largest agency holding group by a merger of the Omnicom Group and the Publicis Groupe. Mr. Sorrell also said the effort to revive the United Network was “independent of” and unrelated to the merger, which may be completed by next spring.

WASHINGTON — On Friday, Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, tried to phone Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, with some bad news: as many as five Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee were “no” votes for Lawrence H. Summers, the White House’s favored candidate for the position of chairman of the Federal Reserve.        


Mr. Merkley had patchy cellphone reception at the Pendleton Round-Up, a rodeo in eastern Oregon. Mr. McDonough was dealing with other business and could not be reached, so Senator Merkley left a message with his staff.        
That spotty phone call — reflecting the revolt of a number of prominent Democrats, many of them from the liberal wing of the party, but not limited to it — helped to seal Mr. Summers’s fate. Not even an official nominee yet, Mr. Summers, a former Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and a key architect of Mr. Obama’s economic stimulus program, faced long odds in winning Senate confirmation. On Sunday, Mr. Summers pulled out of contention, citing a potentially “acrimonious” battle that could harm the economy and Mr. Obama’s presidency.        
Senate Democrats did not “want the fight,” said one Congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. “They don’t want another fight that divides Democrats, and brings back to the forefront a bunch of the issues we dealt with during the crisis and the bailout.”        
The aide continued: “And they don’t want to spend the political capital to get this guy through.”        
Ultimately, they got their way.        
In its search for a new Fed chairman, the White House had for months centered on Mr. Summers, who smarted after being passed over for the position when Mr. Obama decided four years ago to name Ben S. Bernanke to a second term as chairman. This time, with Mr. Obama determined to replace Mr. Bernanke after eight years in office, the White House has weighed other candidates, including Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s vice chairwoman, and Donald L. Kohn, a former Fed official. But many top economic policy officials in the administration considered Mr. Summers, who worked intimately with them during the financial crisis, by far the best candidate.        
The White House assigned Rob Nabors, a deputy chief of staff, to work with him, and recruited two former campaign consultants, Jim Messina and Stephanie Cutter, to talk him up to the press.        
But a number of Senate Democrats, rather than waiting for the nomination process to play itself out, raised concerns as soon as his name surfaced this summer: his reputation for being a divisive colleague, his perceived role in coddling Wall Street and the lax regulation of derivatives, and complaints that he did not support smaller community banks as much as the nation’s giant financial institutions, among other issues.        
In July, those senators strongly signaled to the White House that they preferred Ms. Yellen. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio drafted and circulated a letter of support for her, which 20 colleagues signed, including Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat. “It wasn’t a subtle maneuver,” one aide said.        
A diffuse group of Democratic senators opposed to Mr. Summers’s nomination might not have scuttled it. But the lawmakers were concentrated on the banking committee, where Fed candidates must win a majority vote before they can go for a full Senate confirmation. The senators and staff members on the committee batted around the pros and cons of Mr. Summers for weeks, at times airing their concerns with a White House that some officials described as receptive and some as dismissive.        
After returning from the long Congressional summer recess, Mr. Merkley made an attempt to parse out his colleagues’ positions on Mr. Summers during caucus lunches. He found that as many as four were opposed to, or queasy about, the potential nomination.        
Mr. Merkley and Mr. Brown were strong no votes. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had misgivings and preferred Ms. Yellen, though her colleagues were not sure how she would vote in committee.        
In time, two more senators admitted their concerns. Jon Tester of Montana decided he would oppose Mr. Summers. And Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota expressed some misgivings about Mr. Summers, a Senate aide confirmed, though those concerns were never aired in public.        
The Senate Banking Committee consists of 12 Democrats and 10 Republicans. Every Democrat in the no column would have to be balanced with a yes vote from a Republican to win the support of the committee. By Mr. Merkley’s count, Mr. Summers might have needed as many as five Republican votes.        
For the White House, that would have left two options, Senate aides said, both unpalatable. The first would have been to lean on the Democratic “no” votes, asking members to agree to pass Mr. Summers out of committee even if they intended to vote against him on the Senate floor. But the White House had not laid the groundwork for such a strategy. Some Democratic offices had not heard from White House representatives about the nomination at all.        
The second option would have been to barter for Republican votes. Aides described that strategy as possible: many Republicans would have been willing to vote for Mr. Summers, they said, for a price. But handing the Republicans leverage in the midst of the debt ceiling and budget debates would have weakened the White House’s hand.        
White House advisers, including Mr. McDonough and Valerie Jarrett, were opposed to any such trade-offs. Mr. Summers, with his own well-honed political antenna, picked up the signals from Washington.        
Ms. Yellen has again become the presumptive front-runner, as she had been for much of the spring. Senate Democrats, for their part, have made their thoughts on her known. Despite lukewarm Republican support, she would almost certainly sail out of committee and clear a full Senate confirmation vote, too.        
“I don’t think it’s any secret that Larry was not my first choice,” Senator Warren said in an interview on MSNBC on Monday. “I think the president is taking his time, he’s thinking through this and we’re having a good and thoughtful discussion, which is a good thing to have in Washington.”

Rhapsody, a digital music service that pioneered the subscription model now dominated by Spotify, has laid off its president, Jon Irwin, along with 15 percent of its staff, as the service struggles to remain competitive in a crowded market.         
Rhapsody International, the service’s parent company, announced the changes on Monday in connection with the arrival of a new investor, Columbus Nova Technology Partners, which has become a significant shareholder in Rhapsody in exchange for an undisclosed investment. Two of the firm’s principals, Jason Epstein and Andrew Intrater, have joined Rhapsody’s board.        
The news of the layoffs was first reported by The Verge, a technology news Web site.        
Introduced in 2001, Rhapsody was one of the first services to sell monthly subscriptions for access to huge libraries of music for streaming online. But with the arrival and rapid growth of Spotify — which has a paid tier as well as a free version supported by advertising — Rhapsody has fallen behind. The company says it has more than one million subscribers, although it has not announced specific numbers since it bought Napster, a competing service, in late 2011.        
The layoffs will affect only staff in the United States, and about 200 employees will remain with the company worldwide, a spokeswoman said. Mr. Irwin will continue as an adviser. In its announcement, Rhapsody said it wanted to “accelerate its efforts in Europe and emerging markets.”        
“Rhapsody International is poised for tremendous growth,” Mr. Epstein said in a statement. “We’ve recently launched the Napster music streaming service in 15 additional countries in Europe, rolled out a partnership with MTV in conjunction with German wireless carrier ePlus and have a strong pipeline of product innovations and global partnerships in place.”        
Rhapsody is privately owned, but some of its finances are disclosed through the public reporting of Real Networks, which owns 45 percent of the service. In its most recent accounting, Real Networks said that Rhapsody had a total of $68.6 million in revenue for the first half of 2013, down 6 percent from the same period the year before; its net loss also grew to $9.2 million, from $5.6 million in 2012.        
By contrast, Spotify has 24 million active users around the world, 6 million of whom pay, and it reported about $578 million in revenue last year. But net losses are common at even the most successful digital music services. Spotify, which says it is focused on growth rather than profitability, lost $78 million last year.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Dozens of Harvard students who were forced to take a year off in the university’s worst cheating scandal in memory are returning this month to some painful moments on a campus that has been changed by their actions.        


Students in the leafy, brick-walled quads describe stilted encounters with those returning and the need to suppress questions like “Where have you been?”        
At the administration’s prodding, professors have become much more explicit about laying down ethical standards for their classes, and presentations on cheating were added to freshman orientation, part of a broader move to give students more reminders about academic integrity. The university is also weighing the creation of an honor code, and a new panel to handle charges of academic dishonesty.        
In March, administrators admitted to searching the e-mail accounts of some junior faculty members, looking for the source of leaks to the news media about the cheating investigation, prompting much of the faculty to protest what it called a breach of trust. That led to a separate investigation, and an effort, still under way, to draft a new policy to protect the privacy of university employees.        
“All of these ethical issues are getting a lot more attention, which can only be a good thing,” said Alexis Dominique, a sophomore from Louisiana. “It’s talked about in every class, it’s on every syllabus — what kind of collaboration is allowed, what the rules are.” But there is also widespread skepticism about what effect the changes will have.        
“I love honor codes, but honor codes are about a culture, and I’m not sure how you get that going,” said Trevor Brandt-Sarif, a junior from California.        
For the suspended students, the return is laced not only with discomfort, but also resentment at what they, their advocates — and even some faculty members — call the university’s refusal to address their teachers’ roles in the affair.        
Administrators declined to comment on that. A spokesman released a statement reviewing the steps Harvard has taken toward “a new, more robust strategy for communicating with all students” about academic integrity.        
In late August 2012, Harvard administrators revealed that nearly half the students in a large class — identified by students as Government 1310, Introduction to Congress, with 279 students — were suspected of having cheated on a take-home final exam in May. Later, administrators said that more than half of those suspected, about 70 students, had been required to withdraw, generally for a year, retroactive to last September.        
For many of those students, the start of the academic year last week meant returning to a campus that spent much of the past year debating what they did and how the university responded. Harvard, which has never said how many students were required to withdraw, also declined to say how many had re-enrolled.        
“It’s weird because I think everybody knows why I was gone, and it’s what they were talking about the whole time, but nobody says anything to my face,” one of the returning students said. Like other students in the group who granted interviews, he insisted on anonymity to prevent his name from being publicly tied to cheating.        
Students who were punished accepted varying degrees of blame, ranging from one who said he warranted nothing more than a stern lecture, to another who said his suspension was fully deserved. All expressed concern about their transcripts bearing black marks that would be seen by graduate schools and prospective employers.        
While many of the accused students hired lawyers, several of those lawyers said that as far as they knew, none had sued Harvard.        
Introduction to Congress was taught by Matthew B. Platt, an assistant professor of government, along with 11 teaching fellows, graduate students who led discussion sessions. From previous years, it had a reputation for being easy, which Dr. Platt reinforced in early 2012, students said, by telling them that attendance was not essential and that he gave many A’s.        
But the semester brought a sharp turnabout. Students reported that grading got tougher and exam questions became harder and more confusing; many of them speculated that Dr. Platt had been pressured by someone above him to change his ways. Dr. Platt has not spoken publicly about the matter, and he and the teaching fellows did not reply to interview requests. Government 1310 has not been offered since spring 2012.

The governing board of Louisiana State University agreed Monday to hand over information about its presidential search to a state district judge, but not to the newspapers that sued for the records. District Judge Janice Clark ruled earlier that the L.S.U. Board of Supervisors violated state public records law by refusing to release the documents, including résumés of the 35 candidates considered. The university’s lawyer, Jimmy Faircloth, argued that releasing the names would take away the university system’s right to appeal. To get the case moving again, Mr. Faircloth and Lori Mince, a lawyer for The Advocate and The Times-Picayune newspapers, agreed that the information would be released to the judge, but would stay under seal. F. King Alexander was hired in March as the system president and main campus chancellor. The search committee refused to release information about other candidates and forwarded only his name to the full board.

ALFRED, N.Y. — It was just about the time they were going to turn off the water that this village recognized it might have a college problem.        


For years, residents have lived in symbiosis alongside two schools: the private Alfred University and Alfred State College, a part of the State University of New York system. The schools capitalize on Alfred’s small-town charms — the single stoplight, the deer wandering in the street — while the village enjoys thousands of students eating, drinking and spending at local establishments, an annual rush of revenue and revelry that arrives as autumn does.        
But cleaning up after those students is less appealing, and made all the more difficult because the colleges, as nonprofit, tax-exempt entities, are under no legal requirement to pay anything for public services. A former tile-manufacturing town in western New York, Alfred has a shockingly skinny tax base: a whopping 90 percent of its assessed value is estimated to be tax-exempt.        
So last year, to try to cover its costs, the village told the schools they would have to pay more for their water. SUNY balked. And that is when the village made a quiet but firm ultimatum: Pay up or go thirsty.        
“It got their attention,” said Virginia Rasmussen, a Village Board member. “And we got the check.”        
With increased financial pressures on municipalities across the country, as well as on places of higher learning, town-versus-gown squabbles over Pilot payments — an acronym for payments in lieu of taxes — are increasingly common and often contentious.        
In July, Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island signed a bill requiring Bryant University to negotiate a payment for services with its hometown, Smithfield.        
Pilot fights have also gotten testy in Pittsburgh — where the city and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center have sued each other over the center’s tax-exempt status — and in Princeton, N.J., where the approval of a $300 million arts center for Princeton University was dogged by questions over how much the Ivy League institution should pay into local coffers.        
Such disputes usually involve major institutions and the cities that host them. It is rarer for a battle to break out in a tiny spot like Alfred, despite financial strains that can be acute.        
“It is a perennial problem in these communities,” said Peter Baynes, the executive director of the New York Conference of Mayors, which has argued — unsuccessfully — for changes in state law to allow local governments to require payments from tax-exempt entities. “And certainly while they wouldn’t want to trade those schools, there is this fiscal recognition that while 100 percent to the community is receiving the service, only a fraction of the community is paying.”        
Tax-free policies have also been in the spotlight in New York. In June, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed a new law allowing SUNY branches and some private colleges to offer tax-free zones for new businesses that open on or adjacent to their campuses.        
While officials in villages like Alfred and other upstate college towns like the idea of more jobs, the idea of more tax-free property is less appealing.        
“You’re taking more stuff off the table,” said Justin Grigg, the mayor of Alfred and a professor at Alfred University. “And it’s a pretty small table already.”        
And it is not just in his town, he added. “This is not just an Alfred problem,” Mayor Grigg said. “This is a statewide problem.”        
He mentioned Mr. Cuomo’s plan in a letter sent to Alfred State and Alfred University in June, asking each to voluntarily pay $75,000 this year for public services, saying “we are concerned about tax-free campuses being wrapped by tax-free businesses.”        
But the governor’s office says localities do not need to worry about losing income under the new law because businesses that open on property adjacent to tax-free schools will not be automatically taken off the local tax rolls, although their employees will be exempt from state taxes.        
In many ways, Alfred is much more college than village. The full-time, taxpaying resident population is only about 1,000, many of whom work at or make a living through business from the colleges.        
During the academic year, some 6,000 students descend on the village, studying on the hillside campuses and playing in the village’s clutch of bars, restaurants and requisite pizza place.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — There was an excess of negative statistics to cull from the Giants’ 41-23 loss to the Denver Broncos on Sunday, but there is one measurement — viewed with a twist — that is more illustrative than any other.        


The Giants were 1 for 11 in third-down conversions. That is a staggering lapse, but in truth, the problem isn’t third down, it’s first and second downs.        
The Giants are averaging 2.2 yards a carry and only 36.5 rushing yards a game. The inability to run the football is destroying every tenet upon which the Giants’ offense is built. An effective running game on first and second downs not only puts the Giants in attainable third-down situations, it allows Eli Manning to make credible play-action fakes in the backfield, a necessity for downfield passing.        
In a quiet Giants locker room, Manning said, in effect, on Monday that opposing teams were unaffected by his play fakes. The Giants are wasting time trying them. Before the snap, the defense has already aligned itself to play the pass and ignore the feeble running attack.        
“If you’re not running the ball well, they can keep the safeties very deep,” Manning said. “It’s not really a play-action situation.”        
And when the Giants get nowhere on the ground on first and second downs, even a top-level quarterback like Manning becomes overmatched by the defense’s strategic advantages.        
“We had four third downs where it was third-and-13 or more,” Manning said. “Those are hard to convert.”        
The Giants were also in two third-and-8s, a third-and-9, two third-and-10s and a third-and-11.        
There is nothing “inside football” about this. It’s elementary.        
But what should worry every Giants fan is whether there is anything the team can do about it before next season.        
The new starting running back, David Wilson, has yet to show he can run between the tackles. The backup is Brandon Jacobs, who ran for 4 yards on seven carries Sunday and now has 11 rushing yards in 12 carries during his last two N.F.L. seasons. The third back is Da’Rel Scott, a second-year player with promise but little experience.        
The rushing troubles are not the fault only of those handed the football.        
As Coach Tom Coughlin said about the running game Sunday, “We’re certainly not knocking them back off the ball.”        
An offensive line has often been likened to a clenched fist. Because of injuries, the offensive line has not been together as a unit to deliver many punches. And there may be bigger concerns than continuity. The preseason starter at right tackle, David Diehl, is out with a thumb injury. Center David Baas and right guard Chris Snee are coming off injuries. Right tackle Justin Pugh is a rookie. Is a clenched fist even possible at this point?        
After watching videotape of Sunday’s game, left guard Kevin Boothe said on Monday that the blocking problems were not caused by breakdowns up and down the line, but by the failures of different individuals at different times.        
“We had a number of plays where everything was going right but we had a breakdown in one area,” he said.        
Or as Manning put it: “It’s not one guy messing up over and over, and it’s not everybody messing up. But like anything else, one breakdown can ruin everything.”        
If the offensive line’s problems are not resolved soon, where can the team turn? There are no seasoned veterans waiting in reserve. Diehl will return to the lineup, but he struggled last season as well.        
And what of Wilson, the closest thing to a savior at running back that the Giants have? Until Andre Brown comes back from his broken leg in mid-November — and in retrospect, Brown’s absence has been devastating — Wilson is the only answer.        
But the 5-foot-9, 205-pound Wilson simply may not be a back in the classic Giants mold. The offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride may have to find ways on first and second downs to get Wilson the ball in unconventional ways, to use his speed and quickness away from the congested middle of the line.        
“You can find ways to give him the ball and get him in the open field,” Manning said. “We may need to do that and use him somewhat differently.”        
Manning looked hopeful but concerned, as if he knew what was at stake. The rest of the locker room is waiting, too.        
“The running game isn’t doing well,” defensive end Justin Tuck said. “And I think that’s making Eli press a little. The chemistry isn’t clicking right now. But I mean, I have no doubt they’ll figure it out.”        
The season probably rests on it.

TOKYO — Each day before dawn, the world’s largest fish market comes to life in frantic activity, a last holdout of an older, quainter Japan.        


Workers in rubber boots slosh through inch-deep water, while others dart by on motorized carts carrying plastic-foam boxes with every manner of creature that can be hauled from the sea, from dagger-shaped silver sardines and spider-like crabs to the deflated protoplasmic blobs of mysterious deep-sea predators. In one corner, auctioneers loudly hawk the huge frozen torsos of prize tuna laid in rows on the floor. Nearby, fishmongers in open-air stalls carve the tuna flesh into ruby-red bricks for sale to sushi bars and grocers.        
Soon it will be gone. The city is planning to spend $4.5 billion to relocate the market — nicknamed Tsukiji for the neighborhood that surrounds it — to a modern, climate-controlled distribution center on a manufactured island in three years. The move is part of a broader face-lift Tokyo is planning before the 2020 Olympics.        
For the many who have opposed the change, the relocation will bring not only the loss of a historic, 78-year-old marketplace, but also another blow to a vanishing way of life. Tsukiji has been a place where merchants haggled face to face, and where even the lowliest fishmonger displayed the obsession with freshness that helped Japan bring sushi to the world. Its passing is part of a broader transformation, away from the tiny mom-and-pop shops specializing in everything from tofu to rice cakes that have been increasingly replaced by big-box supermarkets and fast-food chains.        
Officials say they want to redevelop the market’s approximately 50 acres of land — valued in the billions of dollars — into high-rise apartment buildings and a tunnel that would connect Tokyo to the islands that will house new Olympic sites. They, and many who work at the market, also say the move is necessary to keep up with changing times, as the same fast-food chains and supermarkets that have changed Tokyo’s urban landscape have increasingly shunned Tsukiji as too expensive and slow.        
Opponents counter that the relocation is yet another example of the skewed priorities of Japan’s development-happy bureaucrats, who they say want to tear down what has become one of the city’s most popular tourist destinations to enrich big construction companies and real estate developers.        
“Tsukiji was the beating heart of the sushi culture that spread across the world,” said Kazuki Kosaka, a former local assembly member who opposed the relocation. “And now it will be redeveloped into condominiums.”        
When moving Tsukiji was first proposed 14 years ago, it spurred widespread opposition, even leading to rare street protests. They were led by so-called middle wholesalers, the traditional middlemen who buy from big wholesalers and sell to restaurants and other retailers; they feared the new market would allow large corporate wholesalers to squeeze them out. In 2001, the plan appeared doomed after the discovery of toxic contaminants at the new site, which had housed a refinery for converting coal into natural gas.        
But city officials were undeterred, chipping away at opposition by offering subsidies to help pay for the move. Last year, the union representing the middle wholesalers, who number about 700, switched its position and came out in favor of the move, which is considered a done deal barring some last-minute reprieve.        
After delays, Tokyo says it is on track to complete the yearlong cleanup of the new site by March. Workers there now spend their days scraping off several feet of contaminated topsoil to replace it with clean dirt. But critics fret that the cleanup will not convince skeptics that seafood whose value lies partly in its pristineness is safe.        
“The Tokyo government is using the Olympics as an excuse to distract people from the contamination issue,” said Makoto Nozue, 76, who has bought and sold tuna at the market for six decades. “Tsukiji is a globally known brand name and a cultural treasure. Why throw this away?”

EPHRATA, Pa. — They may be the most pampered chickens on the planet.        


On certain days, a truck pulls up alongside their quiet, spacious coop on an Amish farm here and delivers a feast that seems tailored to a flock of two-legged aristocrats. Before long, the rust-colored birds are pecking away at vegetable peelings and day-old bread from some of Manhattan’s most elegant restaurants, like Per Se, Daniel, Gramercy Tavern, the Modern and David Burke Townhouse.        
It is all part of an experiment that is bringing together elite chefs, preindustrial farming practices and a breed of French poultry that is rarely found in the United States. The goal: to see whether American restaurants can turn back the culinary clock and rediscover “what a chicken should taste like,” said Ariane Daguin, the pioneering businesswoman who is behind the idea.        
Can scraps from acclaimed restaurants, where the best ingredients are used, create the table-to-farm-to-table chicken of the future — and the past?        
New York diners will get to nibble on the results this week. After having been fattened up in Pennsylvania, about 220 of what the D’Artagnan company is calling Green Circle chickens will start showing up (usually roasted) on dinner plates at the same restaurants that helped feed them. For high-end chefs, who engage in a perpetual contest to track down the purest and most rarefied ingredients, it is a tantalizing prospect.        
“When I tasted it, I was like, ‘Whoa,’ ” said Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who plans to start incorporating the chickens into his ever-evolving menus. Witnesses say that after his first bite, Mr. Vongerichten was on the verge of tears; Daniel Humm, the chef at Eleven Madison Park, consumed an entire chicken in one sitting.        
Still, a few raised eyebrows are to be expected. The image of chickens gorging on four-star ingredients can seem a rather operatic manifestation of today’s obsessions over food.        
“I do think in some ways it’s a wonderful reaction to corporate poultry and corporate farming in general,” said Matthew Mills, a creator of “Fodder,” a satirical online show from the Cooking Channel. “But at the same time, it swings so far to the other side that it’s almost an Onion headline.” He cited a well-known episode of “Portlandia,” in which two diners aggressively interrogate a waiter about the provenance of a chicken.        
Clark Wolf, a prominent restaurant consultant, agreed. “On one side, it sounds kind of wonderful and magical, and on the other side it sounds like the biggest stunt I’ve ever heard,” he said. “I mean, you know — let them eat zucchini?”        
Ms. Daguin, the French-born founder and chief executive of D’Artagnan, a company that has played a major role in bringing ingredients like foie gras, game birds and Berkshire pork into the broader American marketplace, said that it was not a stunt, but part of a continuing mission to change the world by changing its palates.        
Ms. Daguin, 55, recalled moving to Greenwich, Conn., from France in 1977 to work as an au pair and getting her first bite of mass-produced American chicken. “It was a crime,” she said.        
For Ms. Daguin (as for Gallic chefs like Mr. Vongerichten and Daniel Boulud), a distaste for chicken that was “mushy and full of water,” as she put it, was intensified by nostalgic memories of chickens back home that wandered around the yard nibbling on carrot tops, onion skins and old baguettes — and ended up tasting rich and meaty, with an almost chewy texture.        
What would happen, she wondered, if you took a heritage-breed chicken (in this case, one common to Gascony, the region of southwestern France where she grew up) and fed it scraps from fine restaurants?        
For chefs like Michael Anthony at Gramercy Tavern, there is a philosophical appeal in finding uses for those scraps — and in supporting a fresh but old-school alternative to factory farming. “We know the horror of the caged birds,” Mr. Anthony said.        
Ultimately, it comes down to taste. In restaurant circles, a chicken that tastes like chicken is something of a holy grail. About half a dozen chefs have signed up so far, though the roster of restaurants is still in flux.        
When Ms. Daguin approached Mr. Boulud with her proposal, he grasped it instantly, having grown up with similarly pastoral experiences. “For me it was not a foreign idea,” he said. (He contributed scraps from his restaurants as the food supply for a test run.)        
Of course, these chickens are not dining on stale loaves from grandmother’s breadbox. On a recent afternoon at the farm, where a few hundred creatures inhabit a peaceful, 15,000-square-foot coop that would dwarf the size of most New York apartments, they clucked and ambled around pans of bread soaked in fresh milk, and white buckets full of leafy trimmings that would make a tremendous tossed salad.        
“Some of this is nicer stuff than I have to eat when I get home,” said Mike Charles, a local poultry expert involved in the project.

In the first hint of how the Brain Initiative announced by President Obama in April could take shape, an advisory group on Monday recommended that the main target of research by the National Institutes of Health should be systems and circuits involving thousands to millions of brain cells — not the entire brain or individual cells and molecules.        


The National Institutes of Health working group was meant to focus specifically on how the federal agency should spend its $40 million brain initiative budget in 2014. However, Dr. Rafael Yuste, a neuroscientist at Columbia University who was not a member of the group, said that the recommendations, which he agreed with, were so ambitious that it “could be a charter for neuroscience for the next 10 to 15 years.”        
Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the N.I.H., who accepted the report and its recommendations, said that he had asked the group, led by Cori Bargmann of Rockefeller University and Bill Newsome of Stanford, to think big, and that it would be the job of the N.I.H. to make actual spending decisions.        
Dr. Bargmann agreed that the overall goal of figuring out “how circuits in the brain generate complex thoughts and behavior” was not something to be tackled with the $40 million that the N.I.H. hopes to have for 2014.        
“You can’t do all of that in year one, you can’t do all of that with $40 million, and you can’t do all of that at N.I.H. either,” she said.        
The $40 million for the N.I.H. is part of a White House proposal for $100 million in spending on the initiative in the 2014 budget. The initiative also includes money for the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Several major private research foundations are also joining in the effort with their own research.        
The report recommends that the N.I.H.’s immediate goals should be to develop new tools to investigate both animal and human brains and to accomplish basic, but so far elusive, goals like determining how many different types of neurons there are, what they do and how to study them. It proposed nine high-priority research areas, all of which could take many years and involve other agencies and institutions. But the report, said Dr. Collins, is “a great blueprint for getting started.”        
Comment during the presentation of the report, which was open to the public online, included some complaints from clinicians that the money should be directed to other areas like brain banks and specific diseases.        
Gerald Rubin, the executive director of the Janelia Farm Research Campus in Virginia, part of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and one of the private partners in the overall Brain Initiative, said he saw the report as “more of a manifesto for getting $500 million a year.”        
“They’ve given the vision for a grand challenge,” he said, and he had “the highest praise and gratitude for their work.”        
“They just need to get the money,” he said.        
The working group will deliver a full report in June, after receiving public comment.

Chin Peng, a Communist guerrilla leader whose tenacious, bloody struggles for an independent Communist Malaysia pitted him against Japanese invaders, British colonialists and finally the government of what had become his own newly sovereign nation, died in exile on Monday in Bangkok. He was 88.        


Agence France-Presse, the French news agency, said the cause was cancer, quoting a retired Thai military commander who had acted as a liaison between Mr. Chin and the authorities. Mr. Chin had lived in Thailand for many years.        
Mr. Chin was the last surviving revolutionary leader to have successfully fought for independence from colonial rulers in Asia after World War II — a cohort that included Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, Sukarno in Indonesia, Aung San in Burma (now Myanmar) and Norodom Sihanouk in Cambodia. When he finally laid down his arms in 1989, Mr. Chin was called “the world’s senior surviving guerrilla.”        
Chin Peng was the nom de guerre of Ong Boon Hua, who had joined with the British to battle Japanese troops after they invaded what was then British Malaya in 1941. His honors for heroism included the Order of the British Empire.        
But after the war, as the newly named head of Malaya’s Communist Party, he ordered an armed insurrection against the British colonial rulers, and when Malaya became independent of Britain in 1957, the insurgency morphed into a fight against the new government.        
(Malaysia, consisting of Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore, came into being in 1963. Singapore became independent of Malaysia in 1965.)        
“I suppose I am the last of the region’s old revolutionary leaders,” Mr. Chin wrote in his 2003 memoir, “My Side of History. “It was my choice to lead from the shadows, away from the limelight.”        
He may not have actually had a choice. By the mid-1950s, the British had effectively put down the Communist offensive, although a final peace agreement would not be signed until 1989. Mr. Chin disappeared, although his voice was heard on broadcasts of the clandestine Malaysian Revolution Radio. Then he fell silent, and it was assumed that years of living in the jungle had taken their final toll on him.        
It turned out that in 1960 he fled to China, the principal backer of the Malaysian Communists, who themselves were mainly ethnic Chinese. He later moved to Thailand. After the 1989 peace pact, he tried to return to Malaysia but was refused entry.        
Ong Boon Hua was reported to have been born on Oct. 21, 1924, in the Malaysian state of Perak. His father, an immigrant from Fujian Province in southeast China, made a good living selling and repairing bicycles, and sent him to English-language schools, where he excelled. Attracted to Communism as a means of fighting prejudice against Chinese-Malayans, he joined party youth organizations at 15.        
Soon he left school and went to work for the party, which assigned him to lead three anti-Japanese organizations for students, teachers and shop assistants. After the Japanese invaded in December 1941, he became a liaison to British commandos. The Associated Press reported in 1989 that John Davis, a British officer, said of him, “Unusual ability, and commanded the natural respect of men without fuss or formality.”        
After the war, Lai Teck, secretary general of the Malayan Communist Party, fled with most of its money after collaborating with both the Japanese and the British. Mr. Chin was placed in charge of investigating him, and was appointed to replace him in 1948 at age 24.        
He ordered an armed struggle, perhaps on instructions from Moscow, and began by attacking two rubber plantations and methodically executing three planters. Twelve years of violence, which came to be known as the Malayan Emergency, ensued. A $250,000 reward was offered for information leading to Mr. Chin’s capture.        
At the height of the conflict, some 70,000 British, Australian, New Zealand, Fijian, Gurkha and other British Commonwealth troops fought about 10,000 guerrillas. More than 10,000 fighters and civilians died between 1948 and 1960. Britain rescinded the Order of the British Empire it had granted him.        
“I make no apologies for seeking to replace such an odious system with a form of Marxist socialism,” Mr. Chin wrote. “Colonial exploitation, irrespective of who were the masters, Japanese or British, was morally wrong.”        
In 1955, Mr. Chin emerged from the jungle to negotiate with Malayan officials at a schoolhouse near the Thai-Malay border. Talks broke down after Malayan negotiators refused Mr. Chin’s demand to be part of a coalition government. Though the point was largely moot after Malaya’s independence in 1957, fighting sputtered on, with periodic escalations.        
When it finally ended in 1989, some 1,200 guerrillas were allowed under the peace pact to returned to civilian life.        
Mr. Chin thought the 1989 agreement provided for his own return to Malaysia, but he was denied in court on the grounds that he could not prove he was Malaysian, having lost his birth and citizenship certificates. Many said the real reason was a lingering resentment over the insurrection.        
Information about his survivors was not available. Mr. Chin’s wife, Khoon Wah, is deceased. They had two sons. The Malaysian police have refused to allow his remains to be returned to his home country.

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg; the schools chancellor, Dennis M. Walcott; and senior education officials took a victory lap of sorts on Monday, visiting 22 New York City public schools that ranked among the state’s top 25 in reading and math exams given last spring.         
The performances on the new exams, which were some of the first nationwide to be aligned with a more rigorous set of standards known as the Common Core, offered Mr. Bloomberg a chance to boast about his education record as his 12-year run as mayor comes to a close.        
“Our administration’s core philosophy, when it comes to education, has always been, if we raise our expectations, our kids will meet them,” Mr. Bloomberg said at Talented and Gifted Young Scholars, a citywide gifted school in East Harlem that was one of the 22 high-scoring schools.        
The mayoral blitz, carried out with militaristic precision, came as the two men campaigning to lead the city in the post-Bloomberg era have been offering a stark contrast on educational issues.        
The Democratic nominee, Bill de Blasio favors undoing much of the Bloomberg administration’s centerpiece educational policies by slowing the growth of charter schools and ending, for at least a year, the practice of closing low-performing schools. The Republican candidate, Joseph J. Lhota, has defended the mayor’s record on education and wants to expand the number of charter schools.        
Mr. Walcott has warned in recent months that schools would be in peril if the next mayor reversed Mr. Bloomberg’s policies. But Mr. Bloomberg has decided not to endorse anyone in the race and on Monday sidestepped any discussion about his successor.        
“All I know is what we’ve done,” said Mr. Bloomberg, who listed some of the facts he deems creditworthy, including the achievement of students, the increasing desire of families to be a part of the school system and the city’s ability to attract “the best and the brightest” teachers from around the country.        
Less than one-third of New York City’s students passed the reading and math tests this year, as scores dropped in virtually every school in the state. On the whole, city students outperformed those in other large districts in the state, and the city’s passing rate nearly matched the state’s, even though the city has many students who are poor or not native English speakers.        
“We have been closing the gap with the state for a few years now, and that just has not happened, to the best of my knowledge, in any other state where there are a lot of big cities,” Mr. Bloomberg said.        
But gaps in achievement between black and Hispanic students and their counterparts have continued to persist. And many of the 22 schools that the mayor showcased on Monday were in well-to-do neighborhoods or were highly selective in their admissions, including the Anderson School (No. 1 in the state); New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math, or NEST+m, (No. 4); the Brooklyn School of Inquiry (No. 18); and TAG Young Scholars (No. 20).        
Officials, however, noted that seven of the schools on the list were opened after Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002, including three that hew to the administration’s goal of giving poor students more choice: the Active Learning Elementary School in Queens and two Success Academy charter schools in the Bronx.        
Batting away any criticism that most of the city’s students could not score high enough to be considered proficient in English or math, he said: “Are we where we want to be? No. And incidentally, we’ll never be where we want to be. This concept of proficiency is, I’ve always thought, so misleading. There’s no Nobel Prize winner that I know that says, ‘I’ve stopped studying, stopped learning.’ ”

Business,"










SAN FRANCISCO — When it comes to making money, Twitter is all about keeping it simple. There are no banner ads, no dancing animations, no ads inserted between screens that you must click to get past.        


Virtually all of the company’s revenue, which is projected to be nearly $600 million this year and $950 million next year, comes from three basic advertising formats that blend smoothly into its core microblogging service, whether users are accessing it from a mobile phone or a Web browser.        
“What they have been able to do very well is develop products that meet the needs of most advertisers without being overly complex,” said Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst for social media at eMarketer, a research firm.        
But the simplicity of Twitter’s products is also a weakness, especially when compared with other social networks like Facebook. The company does not have concrete demographic information about individual users, like gender and age, to allow it to sell highly targeted ads at expensive rates. And its marketing efforts have largely been oriented toward large advertisers in the United States, with few sales to smaller businesses and only about one-fifth of its ad revenue coming from overseas, Ms. Williamson said.        
Twitter, which announced last week that it had filed confidential paperwork to begin the process of selling stock in an initial public offering, has disclosed virtually no information about its finances. The company declined to comment for this article, citing regulatory restrictions surrounding its I.P.O.        
But eMarketer estimates that the company will bring in $583 million in revenue from advertising this year, and $950 million in 2014. Twitter also makes additional revenue from selling the data in its raw feed of hundreds of millions of messages daily.        
The most common type of Twitter ad, especially on mobile devices, is the promoted tweet. Essentially, advertisers create a Twitter message — limited to 140 characters like any other message on the service — and pay to insert it into the flow of messages that a user sees, based on certain traits like age, gender or keywords that a person is interested in.        
So if you search for “Apple iPhone” on Twitter, the first message that is likely to appear is a paid ad from Google’s Motorola unit, which is running a campaign proclaiming the virtues of its Android smartphones (“Love to talk? Moto X responds to your voice — no touching necessary,” reads one) or from Microsoft, which is pushing its Windows Phone devices (“Watch how the 41-megapixel #WindowsPhone Nokia Lumia 1020 makes any seat the best seat in the house”). Both companies are bidding against each other to reach people interested in the iPhone.        
In many ways, the results resemble the ads that pop up at the top of the page after a Web search on Google, which also emphasizes simplicity in its ad business.        
As with Google, Twitter’s advertisers set key parameters like target audience and how much they want to spend, and then computer programs submit bids instantly to serve ads to available slots.        
Advertisers pay only when someone interacts with an ad, such as by retweeting it to their followers, commenting on it or marking it as a favorite. That typically happens only 1 to 3 percent of the time. To get that rate on the higher side, Twitter’s system does not just automatically award an ad slot to the highest bidder; instead, it gives an advantage to ads that previous viewers have found to be more relevant or engaging.        
The holy grail for advertisers is an ad that is widely shared by Twitter users to their own followers. To increase the chances of going viral, brands will often embed photos and videos into their ads.        
Twitter’s other ad formats are even simpler.        
The company’s list of trending topics, the most popular 10 or so subjects being discussed at any given moment on the service, is well known as a window into society’s transient obsessions. Advertisers can pay a flat fee to buy their way onto the list. The price for such a promoted trend, which is clearly labeled, varies by country, but runs about $200,000 for 24 hours of exposure to every Twitter user in the United States.        
Companies or people seeking to build followers for their accounts can also pay to appear on the top of the list of new accounts to follow that Twitter suggests to each user.        
As Twitter prepares to sell stock to the public, the company is planning initiatives that will add complexity to its advertising business while also diversifying its revenue stream.        
Last week, for example, it announced that it had agreed to acquire MoPub, a start-up that acts as a middleman in placing ads from marketers inside mobile applications. MoPub does something quite different from Twitter, auctioning off two billion ad slots a day in apps like Songza and OpenTable through dozens of ad networks and delivering the ads so quickly that a user firing up the app barely notices.        
But Jim Payne, chief executive of MoPub, said the two companies shared a common DNA. Like MoPub, he said, Twitter “was designed to be mobile and it was designed to be real-time.” He said Twitter had promised to let MoPub continue building out its current business even as the two worked together to improve the ad offerings on Twitter itself.        
Ms. Williamson, the eMarketer analyst, said MoPub could become a significant source of revenue for Twitter.        
“MoPub’s technology will streamline their self-serve platform,” she said. “It gives Twitter entree into the real-time bidding business, the ad network business, mobile app ads.”        
Through its Amplify program, Twitter is also aggressively promoting joint ad sales with television channels. ESPN, for example, can show game clips on Twitter that are sponsored by an advertiser, with Twitter and the channel sharing revenue.

TEHRAN — Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, told Revolutionary Guards commanders on Monday that Iran would support whomever Syrians want as their leader even if it is not the country’s staunch ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.        


The statement appeared part of Mr. Rouhani’s diplomatic push to present himself as more conciliatory than his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose strident tone helped further isolate Iran. “Whoever Syrian citizens vote for to rule their country, we’ll agree with it,” Mr. Rouhani said, adding that the next election was scheduled for 2014.        
But Mr. Rouhani’s statement came as a video surfaced online appearing to show Iranian commanders and Revolutionary Guards soldiers training and fighting alongside pro-government militias battling rebels trying to oust Mr. Assad.        
Taken together, the speech and the video, if it is verified, point to the dual tracks employed by Iran as it tries to navigate the Syrian civil war and its widespread impact in the region. While calling for peace and diplomacy, Iran has also aided the government’s war effort. Although Mr. Rouhani stressed Iran’s wish for a diplomatic solution in Syria, the United States has long said Iran was supporting Mr. Assad against the rebels.        
The West, Turkey and several Persian Gulf countries openly support the rebels, providing arms, humanitarian aid and cash to at least keep the rebels strong enough to continue fighting, if not actually bolster the drive to oust Mr. Assad.        
The video surfaced Friday on a Dutch current affairs program. The show’s producer said it had been provided by rebels who said they had recovered it after the cameraman died in battle.        
Restrictions on reporting in Syria prevent independent verification of the video’s provenance. There has been no official Iranian reaction to the footage.        
In the video, men who appear to be Iranian commanders and soldiers are shown on patrol with Syrians, as well as engaged in firefights against rebels. The men speak in Persian with distinct regional accents.        
One commander, who says he is speaking from a base near the northern city of Aleppo, boasts about his men’s accomplishments in Syria and is shown at the base giving orders to some Syrian soldiers.        
Iran usually tries to remain in the background in conflicts, preferring to support local groups rather than sending its own soldiers into battle, but the United States has often accused Iran of sending troops to Afghanistan and Iraq. After two and a half years of fighting, Mr. Assad’s military has begun to wear down, losing momentum and territory — prompting its allies in Iran, and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to provide more robust support.        
With Iran’s help, Syria began to build up militias that took some of the pressure off the conventional forces.        
During his speech to Guards commanders in Tehran on Monday, Mr. Rouhani praised the role of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps in securing Iran’s interests in the region, though he did not address their having any active role in Syria. The West, Mr. Rouhani said, is executing a plan in the Middle East “to consolidate the power of Israel and weaken the resistance,” referring to its military and ideological alliance with Hezbollah and with Syria.        
Syria is of great significance for Iran, he told the commanders. “We will not remain indifferent towards this critical issue.”        
Mr. Rouhani said the West should realize that the Revolutionary Guards do not seek military dominance in the region. “Our discourse is the discourse of democracy, brotherhood and unity,” he said. “Our discourse is fighting with terrorism in the region.” (Mr. Assad has long called the rebels fighting him terrorists.)        
In the footage released to the Dutch public broadcasting program by the Syrian rebel group, the Dawood brigade, one Iranian commander, who calls himself “Haj Esmail,” sits down for long, in-depth interviews with an unnamed videographer. He speaks of training Syrian militia members loyal to Mr. Assad in Tehran and criticizes the Syrian Army for being too rigid with its fighters. “They want to come to our fronts because we show them respect,” he said.

WASHINGTON — Janet L. Yellen told friends in recent weeks that she did not expect to be nominated as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Although she had been the Fed’s vice chairman since 2010 and would make history as the first woman to hold the job, President Obama’s aides made clear throughout the summer that he wanted Lawrence H. Summers, his former chief economic adviser.        


Now, awkwardly, it appears that the president may have to circle back to Ms. Yellen after Mr. Summers withdrew from consideration on Sunday, bowing to the determined opposition of at least five Senate Democrats. On Monday, Ms. Yellen became the front-runner by elimination, officials close to the White House said.        
Supporters of Mr. Summers, including many of the president’s closest advisers, had raised some concerns about Ms. Yellen in recent months. Perhaps most potently, they said that institutions benefited from fresh leadership and argued that Ms. Yellen’s crucial role in creating the Fed’s current policies could inhibit her ability to make necessary changes.        
Some presidential advisers also argued that Mr. Summers brought crisis management experience and a working knowledge of financial markets that Ms. Yellen lacks — although so did Ben S. Bernanke when President George W. Bush selected him as chairman.        
There have been tensions between Ms. Yellen and Daniel Tarullo, a Fed governor with close ties to the president’s economic team who has taken a leading role on issues of regulatory policy. Ms. Yellen also clashed with Gene B. Sperling, head of the National Economic Council, when both were advisers to President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.        
Nonetheless, the president’s advisers insisted throughout the summer that Mr. Obama was not averse to Ms. Yellen but simply more comfortable with Mr. Summers, a former Treasury secretary to President Clinton who was Mr. Obama’s chief White House economic adviser through the height of the financial crisis and recession in 2009 and 2010. In those years he formed a bond with Mr. Obama and others in the White House despite a tendency toward arrogance.        
Stock markets soared on Monday on the withdrawal of Mr. Summers. Many investors regarded him as less committed to the Fed’s monetary stimulus campaign than Ms. Yellen. In trading, the Dow was up 118 points and interest rates down in a show of increased confidence that the Fed would withdraw more slowly from its efforts to stimulate the economy, including bond purchases.        
Ms. Yellen’s supporters waited with a mixture of elation and apprehension for the president’s next step. “Janet Yellen, I hope, will make a terrific Federal Reserve chair,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who was one of those warning the White House against a Summers nomination, said on MSNBC. “The president will make his decision, but I hope that happens.”        
Administration officials and supporters acknowledged that the president would enrage his party’s base if he were now to reject Ms. Yellen and forfeit the chance to name the first woman to the most influential economic job in the world. On the other hand, with no obvious alternatives, the choice of Ms. Yellen — which months ago might have been celebrated as historic — is likely to be seen as Mr. Obama’s reluctant capitulation to his party’s left wing.        
That prospect, and Mr. Obama’s distaste for being pressured into some action, could prompt him to consider other candidates, several former administration officials said.        
The president had already interviewed Donald L. Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman, before Ms. Yellen got the job in 2010 on Mr. Obama’s nomination. For years, Mr. Kohn was among the most influential advisers to former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and thus would have drawn criticism from Democrats, many of whom blame the Greenspan Fed for an antiregulatory stance that encouraged financial excesses that led to crisis.

Reiko Douglas, a Japanese-born entertainer who became a popular guest on American talk shows in the 1960s and ’70s despite the fact that she appeared to speak little English, died on Sept. 9 in Los Angeles. She was 77.        


Her death, from cancer, was announced by Alan Eichler, a family spokesman.        
With her husband, the comedy writer Jack Douglas, Ms. Douglas made many appearances on Jack Paar’s television shows — starting with “The Tonight Show” in the early 1960s and continuing through “Jack Paar Tonight” in the 1970s.        
The Douglases — usually billed in tandem as “Jack Douglas and Reiko” — were also ubiquitous on the shows of Merv Griffin, David Frost, Mike Douglas and Dick Cavett, and on the Johnny Carson incarnation of “The Tonight Show.”        
Ms. Douglas, whose English, the show-business columnist Dorothy Kilgallen wrote in 1960, was actually far better than it appeared, capitalized handily on American parochialism of the day.        
In her first appearance on Mr. Paar’s show she took the stage alongside her husband in traditional Japanese attire. Her heavily accented, nearly incomprehensible replies to Mr. Paar’s questions caused much hilarity among the audience.        
But far from being helplessly adrift in an Anglophone sea, Ms. Douglas was by many accounts in considerable control of the situation: her girlish charm and unassuming speech helped disarm a xenophobic public only a decade and a half after the end of World War II.        
Reiko Hashimoto was born on Sept. 2, 1936, in Kanazawa, Japan. She performed in Japan as a dancer, singer and comedian before moving to the United States in 1955.        
She met Mr. Douglas, a writer for Mr. Paar’s show and others, in 1960, when she shared a bill with him at a Los Angeles nightclub. They married that year.        
Ms. Douglas appears in several comic memoirs by her husband, including “Shut Up and Eat Your Snowshoes!” (1970), about their move to the Canadian wilderness; “Benedict Arnold Slept Here” (1975), which recounts their disastrous attempt to run an inn in Maine; and “Going Nuts in Brazil With Jack Douglas” (1977).        
Mr. Douglas died in 1989. Ms. Douglas’s survivors include their sons, Robert and Timothy, and six siblings.        
In a 1962 interview with the Broadway columnist Earl Wilson, Ms. Douglas, in just six words, intimated how good her English really was. During the interview, Mr. Wilson wrote, he complimented her fluency in the language.        
“Aw, snow job,” Ms. Douglas said.        
“No. Serious,” Mr. Wilson assured her.        
“Serious snow job,” she replied.

MUNICH — IT is election season in Germany, and Angela Merkel, the chancellor, is living through her worst nightmare. The allegedly most powerful female politician on the planet hates campaign politics.        


Ms. Merkel should be confident and upbeat. She has managed the euro crisis quite well; the currency hasn’t collapsed, and Germans are doing fine economically. She leads in the polls by a strong margin and enjoys remarkable approval ratings, despite being in office for eight years. There is almost no chance of her losing her post when voters go to the polls on Sunday.        
Still, something smells foul, and Ms. Merkel is gripped by that wariness that usually befalls her when things are going too well. And this time she may be on to something: is the woman who has succeeded through an iron commitment to consensus and harmony too boring for Germany?        
Ms. Merkel has never been good on the stump. She was elected chancellor twice, but for her, elections evoke a sense of trauma. She almost lost to Gerhard Schröder in 2005 despite a comfortable lead in the polls. Four years later, despite strong poll numbers, she again did worse than expected on Election Day, though her position was secured by her strong coalition partner, the Free Democrats.        
When it comes to elections, Ms. Merkel really is a bad politician. She has never managed to relax and show confidence on the campaign trail. In her only TV debate with her main challenger, Peer Steinbrück of the left-leaning Social Democrats, she seemed distant and passive. On the stump she only recently went into attack mode — and shied back again immediately.        
On Syria, she tried to offer support for America’s efforts against the use of chemical weapons while also heeding the German public’s aversion to military action, only to find herself vulnerable to criticism that she would either follow President Obama blindly or leave him in the lurch, as she did in the Libya crisis.        
She is not a fascinating speaker, though in private she is highly engaging and even funny. She rarely makes a bold move, and even on minor issues she is cautious and thinks through the possible consequences over and over again.        
The paradox is that such weaknesses on the trail are strengths in office. The chancellor’s signature mark is her deliberate, argument-driven, boring, clinical policy style. She takes a problem, cuts it into pieces and tries to find a solution, often heavily technical and always very detailed.        
During the height of the euro crisis, this calm and deliberate style helped her, and though she has her critics, she is arguably responsible for saving the euro zone.        
So why is she such a coward in the campaign? Why is she not cashing in and investing some of the political capital she has amassed? Because Ms. Merkel can’t beat her worst enemy: herself.        
Ms. Merkel is the master of harmony, the den mother of one of the world’s richest economies. But that style almost by definition prevents her from taking the offensive during a campaign.        
And, after eight years in office, Ms. Merkel’s calm, deliberative style may have run its course with German voters. She has basically suffocated most of her political opponents by absorbing their positions, leaving no oxygen for them to breathe. Critics accuse her of sucking all blood from the political life in Germany — a country that loves consensus and is suspicious of too much fighting.        
People want to know what they have to expect over the next four years. They want to have a choice. They deserve more than a hint on how the most powerful country in Europe finally wants to overcome the crisis on the Continent.        
Ms. Merkel knows this, but she won’t change. She dislikes being compared to Margaret Thatcher, but she subscribes to Mrs. Thatcher’s famous dictum: “The lady’s not for turning.” This may come as a shock abroad, where Germany’s neighbors are waiting for Election Day as if it were Christmas. They want and expect to see Germany live up to its potential as a world leader, whether it is on economic or security matters.        
But there are no gifts awaiting, no new, more robust German foreign policy to emerge after the distractions of the election. No miracles will be performed on Sunday.        
Regardless of whether she dominates the election or just squeaks by, Ms. Merkel will govern in the same boring, deliberate style as before. Step by step, crisis after crisis.        
To seal her legacy as a great chancellor, Ms. Merkel must now reinvent herself and show more leadership, both at home and abroad. She needs to take a risk or two, and even be prepared to lose.        
She could afford it — but will she?

Running back Giovani Bernard scored his first two N.F.L. touchdowns, one of them on a short pass that he turned into a 27-yard score, and the Cincinnati Bengals beat Pittsburgh, 20-10, on Monday night in Cincinnati, extending the Steelers’ early-season misery.        


Bernard, a second-round draft pick, had a 7-yard touchdown run in the first half before turning a short pass from Andy Dalton into a third-quarter score — a preview of what the Bengals (1-1) could become with a pass-catching threat out of the backfield.        
The Bengals’ Tyler Eifert also had a big play, making a 61-yard catch that set up Bernard’s touchdown run.        
The Steelers fell to 0-2 for the first time since 2002. An injury-depleted offense could not put drives together consistently, allowing the Bengals to wear down their defense. The Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger completed 20 of 37 passes for 251 yards and a touchdown.        
GIANTS’ ROLLE NOT HAPPY Giants safety Antrel Rolle said that he was displeased by the level of enthusiasm on the Giants’ sideline Sunday.        
“We have a lack of excitement on the sideline, when I look up and down the sidelines, sometimes we’re in it and sometimes we’re not,” Rolle said. “I don’t know what the reason is for that. That passion and emotion is going to carry you over and take care of a lot. We need that. That’s something right now that we’re lacking. We need to find a way to get back to it.”

FISHER BLAMES REFEREES Coach Jeff Fisher says officiating mistakes were the biggest reason the St. Louis Rams fell short in their bid for their second comeback victory. The Rams (1-1) had seven penalties for 53 yards in a 31-24 loss against the Atlanta Falcons. After reviewing tape Monday, Fisher said only two penalties were warranted. (AP) 
PROBATION VIOLATION New England Patriots cornerback Alfonzo Dennard has admitted to violating probation by drinking alcohol and driving in Lincoln, Neb., on July 11. Dennard’s admission came during an appearance in Lancaster County District Court. A judge will announce at a hearing Dec. 5 whether his probation will be revoked. (AP) 
BUCS SAFETY SUSPENDED Tampa Bay safety Dashon Goldson has been suspended for one game for flagrant and repeat violations of N.F.L. safety rules prohibiting hits to the head and neck area of defenseless players. Goldson was penalized for unnecessary roughness against New Orleans for making direct, helmet-to-helmet contact with receiver Darren Sproles. The violation was Goldson’s fifth for unnecessary roughness since 2011 and his second this season. (AP) 
PANTHERS’ SECONDARY HURTING Carolina’s free safety Charles Godfrey has torn his right Achilles’ tendon and is out for the season. Godfrey was injured in the Panthers’ 24-23 loss to Buffalo while breaking up a pass to Bills wide receiver Stevie Johnson in the corner of the end zone. Godfrey, a six-year starter for the Panthers, is considered the secondary’s best player. (AP) 
A SCARE FOR JAGUARS Jacksonville running back Maurice Jones-Drew has a tendon strain in his left foot. Coach Gus Bradley said Jones-Drew will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging as a precaution. Bradley was encouraged that Jones-Drew could be ready to play Sunday. (AP) 
BANGED-UP FALCONS The Atlanta Falcons are without defensive end Kroy Biermann and fullback Bradie Ewing for the season because of injuries. Biermann tore his right Achilles’ tendon and Ewing separated his left shoulder in Sunday’s 31-24 win over the St. Louis Rams. (AP) 
DAY-TO-DAY FOR RICE The Baltimore Ravens are counting on having running back Ray Rice available for Sunday’s matchup with the unbeaten Houston Texans. Rice strained his left hip flexor in Baltimore’s 14-6 win over the Cleveland Browns. (AP)

Our billionaire mayor has seen his golden touch turn to dross of late, and so he decided that he would not bestow his endorsement on a successor.        


It was thought the mayor had just one target for his electoral affections: the Republican Joseph J. Lhota.        
But if legacy weighed on Michael R. Bloomberg, he might have considered strolling over to the Beaux-Arts Manhattan Municipal Building, knocking on the public advocate’s door and offering his endorsement to Bill de Blasio.        
“New York’s progressive choice” might well have slipped out the back door and clattered down the steps to avoid that meeting. Mr. de Blasio has taken great pains to frame himself as the anti-Bloomberg.        
But facts intrude. Mayor Bloomberg’s legacy is far more progressive than Mr. de Blasio and his supporters let on. And the mayor might one day find himself nodding in grudging admiration as a de Blasio administration works to deepen and extend some of his policies.        
From affordable housing to public health to child welfare to the creation of park land to reworking the city’s streetscape, Mr. Bloomberg has an impressive progressive policy legacy. He was a fierce guardian of our endangered watershed. On global warming, his proposed marshlands and natural barriers and tough but fair construction standards are a Sierra Club daydream.        
Park lands edge the waterways, and innovative playgrounds are found opposite the Metropolitan Museum of Art — and at Public School 181, at 1023 New York Avenue in East Flatbush, and in the farthest reaches of Far Rockaway.        
In his first term, he raised taxes to protect services. He gave big raises to teachers. Whatever one makes of his education reforms (and I’m often critical), he built grand new schools and tried to crack open a calcified system.        
He was less a Republican than a chameleon, changing affiliation from Democrat to Republican to independent as his electoral desires dictated.        
Michael Gecan and the Industrial Areas Foundation, a coalition of congregations and neighborhoods, battled this administration. But they also worked with it to build a gleaming school in Mott Haven in the Bronx. And they built working-class homes in Brooklyn across Brownsville and East New York.        
“George Bush doesn’t do that. Or Rick Perry in Texas,” Mr. Gecan noted. “Those aren’t the actions of a right-winger.”        
O.K. Now that I’ve climbed so far out on this branch as to risk a tumble, let me inch back in. The mayor has been unyielding on stop-and-frisk policing tactics, with their disproportionate effect on black and Latino males. A Mayor de Blasio would retain the tactic as a tool, but significant change looms.        
Culturally, the mayor remains a man of Wall Street, which is to say a deep-dyed capitalist. He does not spend much time contemplating his contradictions. He favors some government interventions — outlawing smoking in bars and banning big urns of soda. But he talks as if others — a few sick days for a pharmacy cashier? a living wage for a hard-working janitor? — threaten the foundation of this city.        
A Mayor de Blasio offers the possibilities of new paths walked. He might press in Albany to raise the minimum wage. Or he might reverse our conservancy-driven tale of rich park-poor park. Chicago and Seattle dedicate money for parks — are we so parochial as to think we have nothing to learn?        
Mr. de Blasio talks of pulling on zoning levers and pushing creatively to extend the city’s reach on affordable housing. If he does so, he will lean heavily on the Bloomberg administration’s creative financing programs.        
Nor is Mr. Lhota the wolf at the door of liberal fears. He is a New York Republican, which in national terms is awfully close to an irredeemable liberal. Recently, he claimed he could deliver a $500 million universal prekindergarten program without identifying where he would get the money. How very John V. Lindsay of him.        
Mr. Lhota and Mr. de Blasio, finally, might consider adopting a Bloomberg trait. When faced with complaints about his initiatives, Mr. Bloomberg had an admirable willingness to say: Feh.        
We’ll talk to you, he suggested, but we won’t stop forever if you disagree.        
Would Mayor Lhota push business backers to swallow a higher minimum wage? Could Mayor de Blasio prevail upon the unions for real concessions?        
The other day, Mr. Bloomberg said he wanted only to offer his successor “a world-class transition.” What he might not realize is that even a liberal successor is likely to stand more in his shadow than either man might guess.

Tropical Storm Ingrid and the remnants of Tropical Storm Manuel drenched Mexico’s Gulf and Pacific coasts with more torrential rains Monday, flooding towns and cities, cutting off highways and setting off deadly landslides in a national emergency that federal authorities said had caused at least 34 deaths. Some of the heaviest damage was in the southern coastal state of Guerrero, where Mexico’s government reported 15 confirmed deaths from Manuel. State officials said people had been killed in landslides, drownings in a swollen river and a truck crash on a rain-slickened mountain highway. Flooding closed the main highway from Mexico City to Acapulco, and power cuts shut the resort city’s main airport.

NEW DELHI — THEY can’t do without the farmer story. When people who wish to transform India through the Internet talk about their plans, they tend to tell a story that goes something like this: A poor farmer is about to sell his crop very cheap when someone, often a smart adolescent granddaughter, checks the market price online, and the farmer makes a more informed decision.        


It appears that technology executives feel they must treat the Internet as something deeply noble and serious in order to substantiate its importance in an impoverished nation.        
Even Facebook, that great time suck of FarmVille, not farmers, seems to have suffered a head injury and is now imagining itself as Mother Teresa. Internet.org, the company’s recent push along with other companies to bring affordable access to the more than two-thirds of the world that is not yet online, has the grave tone of social reformation. Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, said last month that the goal was to “create a backbone for many things, including access to information, access to information about health care, education, jobs and just so many good things.”        
Too many people presume that what the poor want from the Internet are the crucial necessities of life. In reality, the enchantment of the Internet is that it’s a lot of fun. And fun, even in poor countries, is a profound human need. Quality of life is as much an assortment of happy frivolities as it is the bare essentials of survival. And India is a perpetual reminder that a lot of good — even the somber sociological stuff — can come from people setting out in pursuit of joy.        
What the poor want from a technological revolution is probably best understood by watching the way they react to electricity. They do not crave electricity so they can keep newborns warm in incubators. They want it for the simple pleasure.        
Chibaukhera, a village in northern India where electricity has been available only since March of this year, is now under the spell of television. As television sets were much sought-after and prestigious dowries, several houses had them even before they got electricity. Now that the TVs and plugs have finally met, the villagers are hooked on Hindi films and serials about family feuds. In time, they will have incubators, too.        
It is not always true that entertainment is the collateral consequence of progress; progress, often, is the collateral benefit of the pursuit of pleasure.        
So what is the problem if Facebook and others have acquired a halo as they try to reach out to developing nations with false notions about what the poor actually want? After all, they do plan to bring the Internet to places that do not have access. But the tech industry’s misreading of the biggest audience in its own revolution will lure it into committing the same mistake of so many other altruistic projects.        
The last 15 years have seen numerous well-intentioned missions to transform society through computers and the Internet — remember One Laptop Per Child? — but few of them have had much impact.        
Today, of the roughly 207 million occupied rural homes in India, only about 1.2 million have computers with an Internet connection. But there are 300 million cellphone subscriptions in these areas. And according to a recent survey, more than seven million of those users connect to the Internet only through their phones.        
The extraordinary triumph of the cellphone among India’s poor stemmed from its ability to enable a most mundane human need, which is to chat with other people. And when the poor chat, it is not always about curing a child of diarrhea.        
The Indian government has several valiant plans to bring Internet access to the villages, but they largely center on connecting government offices for ID databases and for software simulation to teach citizens skills like plumbing. Wouldn’t it be better if the poor were offered direct connectivity over their phones, free or cheap, and were left to decide what they wanted to do with it?        
Mr. Zuckerberg’s belief that connectivity is a human right is honorable. Where he and his allies err is in imagining that fun is not, and in underestimating the power of entertainment to transform society. Chatting with friends online may not save the world, but if it can get more people to log on, the rest will follow.        
Many years ago, when I worked for a lifestyle magazine, I was given my worst assignment ever. I had to call some of the richest people in southern India and ask them what they usually had for breakfast. The first man I called told me, “I don’t eat gold biscuits.” It was a well-deserved reprimand for presuming that rich people were somehow different from other humans.        
It is equally ridiculous to presume that what poor people want from the Internet is lessons in plumbing.

I was steering my cart through Costco the other day, wondering whether to waddle to the aisle where they sell cashews by the quarter-ton or to the one with thousand-piece packs of chicken thighs, when an epiphany pierced the fog of my gluttony.        


Actually, two epiphanies. The first? I needed to have kids, four or five or better yet a baker’s dozen. Only then could I take full advantage of the savings around me.        
The second? Costco as much as anything else is why the land of the free and the home of the brave is also the trough of the tub o’ lard, our exceptionalism measurable by not only our G.D.P. but also our B.M.I. That’s body mass index, and our bodies are indeed massive.        
I don’t blame Costco per se. I blame what it represents: an American obsession with size, with quantity, that manifests itself as surely in supermarkets and restaurants as it does on our highways. We drive minivans and sport utility vehicles; we rip into veritable feed bags of potato chips and wedge our steroidal Thanksgiving turkeys into refrigerators more capacious than some European cars. This doesn’t redound to our benefit.        
And while the notion that we weigh too much because we buy, order and eat too much may be obvious, it’s increasingly obscured. Study after study and report upon report looks at more particular reasons for obesity and excess pounds, focusing on the edges and the aggravators of the problem instead of the flabby core. And the number and variety of these investigations, not to mention the prominent showcase we in the news media give them, create the impression that alchemy, not appetite, is our enemy, and that if we could just fine-tune our daily schedules, rejigger our protein-to-carbohydrate ratios or wallow sufficiently in fiber, all would be well.        
It’s as if we’re micro-focusing on less daunting and less damning culprits to distract ourselves from the one that’s most fearsome and difficult to change, which is the sheer volume of food that many Americans are accustomed to consuming.        
In The Times alone over the last six weeks, I’ve read stories or blog posts about research that explored the effect of a proper breakfast on weight loss; the implications of gut bacteria on a person’s tendency to be fat or thin; the impact that sleep deprivation can have on dietary cravings; the possible utility of strenuous exercise as an appetite suppressant; and the unhealthy food choices that a favorite sports team’s defeat can cause.        
The examination of how and why we overeat is like some full-employment scheme for physicians, nutritionists, scientists and professors, who have looked at the roles of alcohol, of additives, of peer pressure, of bribes. One book that landed on my desk recently posits that pollution is making us fat and traces the parallel rise in air-conditioning and obesity.        
But these experts haven’t brought us clarity. We’ve been told that snacking is good and that it’s not; that fruits and veggies will save the day and that they won’t; that more exercise means fewer pounds and that it makes no difference.        
What I’ve seen with my own eyes and can intuit with common sense is more consistent and persuasive. For a few years I lived in Italy, where people are generally thinner than in America, and I learned that it’s not because they walk all that much more (one popular theory) or smoke away their hunger (another). It’s because they don’t celebrate huge servings the way that Americans do, and don’t pig out as much as a result.        
The McDonald’s near my office in Rome didn’t supersize anything. I saw no roadside signs for all-you-can-eat buffets. I never encountered a “never-ending pasta bowl,” à la the Olive Garden, nor a Denny’s-style “grand slam.” Italians are content with a base hit.        
Such prompts and cues make a difference. In a famous experiment eight years ago, a Cornell University professor named Brian Wansink put stale (and presumably awful-tasting) popcorn in large buckets and in really large ones. Moviegoers who got the really large ones ate much more. The vessels goaded them to.        
America is lousy with such vessels: the Big Gulp, the economy pack, the party size, two-for-one pizza deals, the Whopper, the Double Whopper, the Triple Whopper, Costco in all its bloated grandeur. They’ve taught us that volume equals value and established a dangerous baseline for what we consider a sane amount of food.        
And that’s a bedrock truism that mustn’t get lost amid a smorgasbord of other, wonkier insights, many helpful to a point, none erasing the importance of portion size. Yes, there are probably better and worse rhythms for daily eating; there are bad calories and good calories. The ones going into you may be sublime. Won’t matter, if you rack up enough of them.

A British company cannot sell merchandise under the name “Knut — Der Eisbär” (German for “Knut — the polar bear”), a European court ruled Monday, closing yet another chapter in the unusual saga of the Berlin Zoo’s late animal celebrity, who enjoyed a cult-like following around the world until his death last year. The General Court of the European Union in Luxembourg upheld an earlier claim by the zoo that the proposed brand was too similar to the registered trademark “Knud,” which the zoo already holds. Marketing the bear has proved especially lucrative for the zoo, which has raked in millions of euros with its Knut-themed trinkets and souvenirs.

Suspected militants set off a roadside bomb in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula on Monday as a bus full of police conscripts drove by, wounding nine of them, security officials said. The blast on the outskirts of El Arish, northern Sinai’s provincial capital, came amid a counterinsurgency operation by Egypt’s military and the police in the volatile desert region. The bus that was bombed Monday was traveling from the border town of Rafah, near the Palestinian Gaza Strip, to El Arish and was escorted by an armored police car. The bomb was set off by remote control, said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

This Op-Doc is part of a suite of short films collectively titled “Translating Edwin Honig: A Poet’s Alzheimer’s,” completed in 2010. The films form a portrait of the distinguished poet, translator, critic and Brown University professor Edwin Honig — who was my cousin, friend and mentor — and his journey through the depths of Alzheimer’s disease. It is the chronicle of a man who, though he may have lost his memory, his relationship to the past and his command of language, still retained his wit, his sense of humor, his scholarly demeanor and the bearings of a deeply poetic soul.        


I couldn’t have made “56 Ways of Saying I Don’t Remember” about anyone but Edwin Honig. It’s the culmination of decades of deep friendship, mutual trust, family kinship, artistic kinship, countless long walks, talks and telephone conversations, often centered on Edwin’s insistence that art should always get to the heart of the matter — to the very bottom of things — an approach he valued in his life and applied to his work, and something I kept in mind throughout the making of the film.        
I was with Edwin the day he agreed to donate his brain to science, for Alzheimer’s research. I’d like to think that my film preserves Edwin’s amazing mind, and allows us to look at Alzheimer’s disease, remembering, forgetting and in many aspects the fragility of life itself, in new and provocative ways.        
Edwin Honig died in May of 2011 at the age of 91.        
Alan Berliner’s experimental documentaries, including “Wide Awake,” “Nobody’s Business” and “Intimate Stranger,” have been widely exhibited at film festivals and museums around the world. He is the recipient of three Emmy Awards, and Rockefeller, Guggenheim and Jerome Foundation fellowships. His feature-length portrait of Edwin Honig, “First Cousin Once Removed,” will premiere in September on HBO. 
         
Poems by Edwin Honig 
“Last Poem” (1997) 
He wrote poems. They had a private sound. A few were long and ran aground. Some were short- too bitter or too sweet. The rest were wild, the worst, discreet.        
         
“The Silence” (1997) 
I listened And waited a long time For what was to be said        
And nothing spoke but a silence so deep it could be speech        
or a primed hesitance of speech to say what’s true        
for ear or mind as yet unborn to take it in        
so that the longer and deeper it grew        
the more the unbroken silence felt full        
         
“Being Somebody” (1983) 
He had need of a way to be himself without being himself.        
He had so little need of those who said they had need of him,        
He wanted never to see any of them again, though he wouldn’t say so.        
For once in his life he was satisfied simply to be simply to be.        
To be nobody, nobody but himself, himself without himself.        
He felt empty and full —  not one or the other but both at once.        
He felt chafed like a child full of flouting wishes, floating elations.        
But drained of hankerings, like a glass of water a thirsty man just drank.        
He considered someone odd though familiar may have come to live inside of him.        
Maybe it meant he was sheltering someone who needed a home.        
He himself had no home, flitting from friend to cousin to stranger,        
As the occasion demanded, or urged by the heart, which he often misread.        
He lived everywhere but at home, where sometimes he stayed overnight.        
Anywhere he slept he was at home, if he didn’t overstay.        
The city he wished most to live in was nearby but quite far away.        
Near enough to visit or be visited by old friends and children,        
Far enough off to forget them all in a week or a year.        
He wanted to live alone in a den-like apartment, working nights on his thoughts,        
Or in a big rambling house without tenants and close to the hub of the city.        
He would like also not to live there but still to call it his home        
Where he could drop in, surprising himself hard at work in his study        
Or, having been called away, finding the place shrieking his absence.        
He’d like to live there and in the country as well, unknown except for        
The gas-meter reader who’d fade in and fade out bimonthly.        
He once wrote a letter he thought he’d only half written himself which ended limply,        
“How many empties like me are there left to pick up before I die?”        
Now he believed the letter was written completely by someone else.        
Of course he was wrong —  but what if he was completely somebody else?

WASHINGTON — First came the “supercommittee,” tasked in 2011 with finding a bipartisan deficit reduction plan but doomed to fail. Then came the “McConnell plan,” a way for Congress to raise the government’s debt limit without actually voting to do so. And in January there was “no budget, no pay,” a measure coupled with the last debt ceiling increase to deny paychecks to lawmakers if they did not pass a budget.        


For three years, Congressional leaders have relied on tactical maneuvers, sleights of hand and sheer gimmickry to move the nation from one fiscal crisis to the next — with little strategy to deal with the actual problems at hand. Medicare and Social Security continue to swell with an aging population. Health care costs grow. A burdensome tax code remains unchanged, and economic revival is shadowed by the specter of Washington’s crisis-driven mismanagement.        
Now, with a government shutdown looming at month’s end and a crippling default on the nation’s debt possible by mid-October, Congressional leaders may have run out the string on legislative trickery. Conservative Republicans in the House have declared they will not go along with any more gimmickry from their leadership. Democrats have vowed they will not help Republican leaders out of their jam without some easing of spending cuts. And a way forward — to keep the government operating and solvent, and to protect the international economy from a default-driven shock wave — is nowhere to be found as the House is set to vote this week on a stopgap spending plan.        
“What is causing this is the inability, at least to this date, of our nation’s leaders — in the House and White House — to make good decisions, timely decisions, that put our country first,” said Representative Scott Rigell, Republican of Virginia. “It’s really no surprise that we’re in this bind.”        
President Obama joined the fray Monday, castigating Republicans for the latest budget crisis but “hoping that a light bulb goes off.”        
“What happens here in Washington makes a difference,” he said at a White House event commemorating the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis that helped propel him to the presidency. “What happens up on Capitol Hill is going to help determine not only the pace of our growth but also the quality of jobs, the quality of opportunity for this generation and future generations.”        
Last week, with the body politic focused on Syria, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, trotted out his answer to the latest fiscal morass. First, the House would pass stopgap funding legislation to keep the government open until mid-December — with a companion clause that would strip all funding to implement President Obama’s health care law. Sure, the Senate could simply ignore the health care provision, but Mr. Cantor assured House conservatives he would come back with an increase in the government’s borrowing limit that would delay the health care law for one year.        
The conservatives’ answer? A boisterous and resounding no.        
“Certainly we’ve often used insider Washington rules and tools — some would call them gimmicks — to protect people from hard votes,” said Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina. “That’s been part of Washington a long time. But what we’re seeing here is an unwillingness to accept this as a first step. You can’t start with a complete surrender.”        
Just five scheduled legislative days stand between the House and a government shutdown. House Republican leaders and their allies say there is still time to persuade their recalcitrant backbenchers to go along with the Cantor plan, or some variant of it. House Republicans will meet Wednesday to hash over their options. But the divisions that have bedeviled Speaker John A. Boehner since he took the gavel in 2011 are back in force.        
“It’s fair to say it looks a little gimmicky, but at least it would prevent a government shutdown,” said Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania who backs the plan. “It’s important that Republicans stop pretending that Mitch McConnell is the Senate majority leader and Mitt Romney is the president,” he said, referring to Mr. McConnell of Kentucky, who as leader of Senate Republicans heads the minority party. Conservatives say they are tired of losing, and they are being egged on by activist organizations that are demanding a hard line. From his new perch heading the right-leaning Heritage Foundation, former Senator Jim DeMint has demanded an end to “pretend votes” and “gimmicks.” The conservative activist L. Brent Bozell III is rallying supporters around legislation that would strip all funds from the Affordable Care Act immediately, saying he’ll accept no less.        
The Club for Growth, a political action committee not bashful about mounting primary challenges to Republican lawmakers from the right, says it will put a black mark on the record of any lawmaker who votes even to bring the Cantor plan to the House floor. And an expanding base of Internet-wired Tea Party ground troops is keeping the pressure on.        
“We’re pushing back on these gimmicks that used to be the coin of the trade in Washington,” said Michael A. Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action, the Heritage Foundation’s political arm. “I think it’s exciting.”        
Republican leaders can be forgiven for their shell shock. For three years such activists have generally looked the other way as Republicans finessed a path from crisis to crisis. In 2011, the House took the nation to the brink of its first-ever debt default, despite warnings from economists that such a move could plunge the global economy into recession.        
The way out, in part, was a special select committee tasked with producing a bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit by around $4 trillion over 10 years. The supercommittee failed, but the legislation that produced it did lift the debt ceiling.        
To do it, however, Mr. McConnell had to dream up another sleight of hand, a two-step process that allowed President Obama to raise the debt ceiling himself, then gave Congress a vote to voice its disapproval. Even if that disapproval could pass Congress, it could be vetoed by the president. Thus the government’s borrowing limit would rise without any lawmaker having to vote explicitly to do it.        
Earlier this year, House Republicans devised another plan to raise the debt ceiling while extracting only a token concession. That concession was the No Budget, No Pay Act, which would have impounded the pay of members of Congress if they failed to pass a budget. Senate Democrats complied, passed a budget, and have berated the House for the past five months for refusing to even try to resolve the vast differences between the House’s spending and tax plan and the Senate’s.        
The House has also all but given up on passing detailed spending bills to comply with its budget.        
“If this is our approach to governance, we are in deep trouble,” Mr. Rigell fumed.        
With the clock ticking, frustration with what Representative Reid Ribble, Republican of Wisconsin, called “all these fiscal cliffs and this dance we go into all the time” may be reaching a crescendo.        
“We just need to find a path forward, and we have to get off these conversations about this small stuff,” Mr. Ribble said. “It’s time we start to deal with the real issues.”

An argument over the teachings of the philosopher Immanuel Kant between two men standing in line for beer at an outdoor festival in southern Russia ended when one man shot the other in the head with gun loaded with rubber bullets, the state RIA news agency reported on Monday, citing the police. Though the wound was not critical, the attacker faces up to a decade in prison if convicted on assault charges. Among educated Russians, including those who drink, classical literature and philosophy are sometimes debated in casual social settings, the way sports often are in Western countries.

Teenagers prosecuted in adult courts or who do time in adult jails fare worse in life and can go on to commit more violent crimes than those who are handled by the juvenile justice system. Neuroscience research has found that these young offenders don’t weigh risks the way adults do, making them prone to rash judgments that can land them in trouble with the law.        


These facts argue for steering adolescents into the juvenile justice system, where they can receive rehabilitative services and be spared adult criminal convictions that banish them to society’s margins and make it virtually impossible for them to find jobs.        
This logic has prevailed throughout the country. But it has, so far, been ignored in New York State, one of only two states — the other is North Carolina — that sets the age of adult criminal responsibility at 16. (Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia consider 18 as the age for adult prosecution, and 11 states set it at 17.) Nearly 50,000 16- and 17-year-olds in New York end up in the criminal courts each year, a vast majority charged with nonviolent crimes like fare beating, marijuana possession or shoplifting.        
That may be changing thanks to efforts by groups like Raise the Age NY, a coalition of justice advocacy groups that argues for raising the age of criminal responsibility to 18. Among those who have rallied to this cause is New York State’s chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, and the Nassau County district attorney, Kathleen Rice.        
Judge Lippman has submitted a bill to the Legislature that calls for the formation of a special court for 16- or 17-year-olds charged with nonviolent crimes. These youth-division courts would have judges specially trained in issues of adolescent development and therapeutic approaches to juvenile crime. If the case is resolved in the youth division, no criminal charges would be filed against the child, fingerprints would be destroyed and all records would be sealed. The goal is to treat children as children instead destroying their lives even before they’ve begun.        
New York’s decision, made in 1962, to define juveniles as those under 16 was meant to be temporary. But inertia quickly set in, causing the erroneous decision to stand for 50 years, even as “tough-on-crime” states began to see that teenagers needed special protection. It is well past time for New York to adopt the same sensible policy.

The idea of creating extensive marine reserves in the Southern Ocean, around Antarctica, seems like a no-brainer. The reserves would protect what is still the most pristine aquatic ecosystem in existence, and they would extend to the ocean some of the international protection that the continent enjoys: the recognition that the south polar region is a world treasure, off limits to the frenzy of resource extraction playing out across the rest of the planet.        


In July, at the most recent meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in Bremerhaven, Germany, there was a nearly giddy sense of optimism that, after repeated failures, the proposal would finally pass. But it failed again, thanks largely to Russia and Ukraine, who raised unfounded legal objections. And while not completely caving in, fishing nations like China, Norway and Japan called for smaller reserves and a “sunset clause” that would allow for future exploitation and essentially render the whole idea of a permanent reserve meaningless.        
All this has led the staunchest supporters of the original 875,000-square-mile proposal — chiefly the United States and New Zealand — to do exactly the wrong thing. Instead of going into the next month’s meeting in Hobart, Australia, with renewed determination, the two countries announced last week that they would agree to shrink the proposed reserves by 40 percent, in the belief that something is better than nothing.        
This decision rewards without a fight the countries that opposed the reserves, and it seems to have more to do with preserving a process than preserving an ecosystem. It makes everyone, even the good guys, complicit in failure. And behind it all is blindness to the true costs of fishing the Antarctic as hard as the rest of the oceans and an inability to grasp the fragility of that Antarctic and the importance of one of its main species — krill — to the rest of the ecosystem. The United States and New Zealand and the European countries that supported the marine reserve had it right the first time.

William Thompson Jr. made a gracious exit from the race for mayor of New York on Monday, throwing his support to Bill de Blasio, who probably got slightly more than 40 percent of the vote in last Tuesday’s Democratic primary, which he needed to avoid a runoff with Mr. Thompson.        


We say probably because the New York City Board of Elections hasn’t finished counting the votes. For the last week, Mr. Thompson has been in the awkward position of hanging around to see whether Mr. de Blasio’s unofficial 40.3 percent holds up. Mr. Thompson, who got 26.2 percent of the vote, saw that his odds were very long, and got on with his life.        
In leaving the race, Mr. Thompson called the board’s failure to deliver official results nearly a week after the vote a “disgrace.” He’s right, though its incompetence is hardly a surprise. This was the election, after all, where more than 5,000 antique lever-action voting machines had to be dragged out of storage because the board knew it couldn’t get optical-scanning machines ready for a possible runoff. The board, whose members are appointed by county leaders of both parties, is a patronage-riddled agency with one job, which it does very poorly. Last Friday, workers were caught snoozing among the voting machines they were supposed to be rechecking.        
The most appealing solution is just to abolish the board, as Mayor Michael Bloomberg has urged for years, and to replace it with a nonpartisan body of skilled professionals. But that would require rewriting the State Constitution, which the Legislature would resist.        
Good-government organizations like the New York Public Interest Research Group say there are many ways to make the board work better, like having city employees replace inept poll workers on Election Day, and having the City Council vet its appointees more strictly.        
Perhaps a good, civic-minded project for Mr. Bloomberg, Speaker Christine Quinn and Mr. Thompson — all of whom know how to run big operations — is to take on reform of this abysmal system.

Young people are different. The Supreme Court has delivered that message repeatedly over the last decade in limiting or flatly prohibiting the most severe criminal punishments for those under 18 at the time of their crime.        


In 2005, the court banned the death penalty for juveniles. In 2010, it outlawed sentences of life without parole for juveniles convicted of crimes other than homicide. And, in a 2012 case, Miller v. Alabama, it said juveniles may never receive a mandatory sentence of life without parole, which prisoners refer to as “the other death penalty.”        
Each ruling, relying on the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment, has found that young people are “constitutionally different” from adults, and, therefore, must be punished differently.        
In each case, the court was silent on the question of whether its ruling applied retroactively to inmates who had already been convicted. The just answer would surely be yes, and courts have largely agreed, making those first two juvenile justice rulings retroactive. But some states insist that the ban on mandatory life without parole does not apply to offenders who have already been sentenced.        
In the Miller case, the court required lower courts to make “individualized sentencing decisions” for juvenile defendants because juveniles are not as morally culpable as adults, and they are more capable of changing over time. If the ban on mandatory life without parole is retroactive, more than 2,000 prisoners would be eligible for a new sentencing hearing. So far, whether these individuals can get a new hearing depends on where they live.        
Courts in Michigan, Iowa and Mississippi have ruled that the ban applies to previously sentenced juveniles. The Department of Justice takes that position as well. Yet the Minnesota Supreme Court and one federal appeals court have taken the opposite view.        
On Sept. 4, the Louisiana Supreme Court took on this question in the case of Darryl Tate, who was 17 when he held up two men and killed one of them in 1981. Mr. Tate’s lawyers argue that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing under the Miller rule, because the United States Supreme Court allowed such a rehearing in another juvenile life-without-parole case decided at the same time as Miller.        
Critics fear that allowing resentencing would increase violent crime. But courts may still impose life without parole, provided that the judge first gives proper consideration to the mitigating effects of youth. The Alabama Supreme Court set out guidelines last week that require a court to consider 14 factors, including a defendant’s age, emotional maturity, family environment and potential for rehabilitation before issuing such a sentence.        
Ideally, life without parole would never be a sentencing option for juveniles. The Supreme Court’s own logic suggests this, even if it was not willing to go that far. After the Miller case, three states entirely eliminated juvenile life without parole, joining six other states that had already banned the sentence, and lawsuits on the retroactivity issue are pending in several states. As lawmakers and courts deal with this issue, they should remember — as the Supreme Court has declared — that adolescents are not adults, and that principle should apply regardless of the date of a conviction.

HOUSTON — Aaron Alexis, 34, the man killed by police officers and identified as the gunman in the deadly rampage at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, served his country as a Navy reservist, had an abiding interest in Buddhism and Thai culture, and had problems with the law, records and interviews show.        


In 2004, according to a Seattle police report, Mr. Alexis walked out of his grandmother’s home one morning, pulled a .45-caliber pistol from his waistband and fired three rounds at a construction worker’s car, two at the rear tires and one into the air.        
A construction manager told the police he thought Mr. Alexis was frustrated with the parking situation outside the work site. But Mr. Alexis told the police that he had had an anger-fueled blackout and could not remember firing the weapon until about an hour after the episode. He said he was in New York during the Sept. 11 attacks, and described to a detective “how those events had disturbed him,” according to the detective’s report. His father told investigators that Mr. Alexis had problems associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, and had been an “active participant” in rescue attempts on Sept. 11. Mr. Alexis’s father could not be reached for comment Monday.        
Anthony Little, Mr. Alexis’s brother-in-law, told reporters Monday in Brooklyn that it had been five years since his wife, Naomi Alexis, had spoken to her brother. “No one saw it coming, no one knew anything, so all of this is just shocking,” he said.        
Law enforcement officials said the motive behind the navy yard shooting remained unclear.        
Mr. Alexis was born in Queens in 1979 and was representative of the borough’s diversity. He was African-American, grew up in a part of Queens that was home to South Asians, Hispanics and Orthodox Jews, and embraced all things Thai while living in Fort Worth. He worked as a waiter at a Thai restaurant, studied the language and regularly chanted and meditated at Buddhist temples.        
From 2007 to 2011, Mr. Alexis was a full-time reservist in the Navy, serving as an aviation electricians’ mate and achieving the rank of petty officer third class. For much of that time, from February 2008 to January 2011, when he left the service, he was assigned to the Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 46, in Fort Worth, Navy officials said. His specialty was fixing electrical systems on airplanes.        
Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said on CNN that Mr. Alexis was in “the ready reserve,” meaning he did not have day-to-day contact with the Navy, but, if called upon, “he would be one of the ones mobilized.” Mr. Alexis was awarded the National Defense Service Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, two standard military honors, but there were indications that he struggled in the Navy.        
During his time in the service, he exhibited “a pattern of misbehavior,” Navy officials said, though they declined to elaborate. Upon leaving, he became a Navy contractor. At the time of the shooting, Mr. Alexis worked for a company affiliated with Hewlett-Packard that serviced the Navy’s Internet system, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement. He had been living for weeks in a long-term-stay hotel with colleagues to work on the Navy Yard project, according to a government official.        
In 2010, Mr. Alexis was arrested in Fort Worth for discharging a firearm. At the time, Mr. Alexis had been living in an apartment complex called Orion at Oak Hill. His upstairs neighbor called the police after she heard a pop, saw dust fly and noticed holes in her floor and ceiling. She told the police that Mr. Alexis had confronted her in the parking lot about making too much noise, and she felt threatened by him, according to the Fort Worth police report.        
Mr. Alexis later told an officer that he had been cleaning his gun while cooking, and that the gun had accidentally discharged. The officer asked him why he did not call the police or check on the resident above him, and he replied that he did not think the bullet went through because he could not see any light through the hole, according to the report. The officer noted that the gun was taken apart and covered in oil.        
James Rotter, the father of the woman in the apartment, said the shot came through close to where his daughter had been sitting. She moved out after the episode, and a lawyer advised the family not to press charges.        
“How could you prove he did it on purpose when he claimed he was cleaning his gun?” Mr. Rotter said.        
In recent years, Mr. Alexis dated a Thai woman and began showing up regularly at Wat Busayadhammavanara, a Buddhist Temple in White Settlement, Tex., a Fort Worth suburb. He had Thai friends, adored Thai food and said he always felt drawn to the culture, said Pat Pundisto, a member of the temple answering the phone there on Monday. He was a regular at Sunday services, intoning Buddhist chants and staying to meditate afterward. On celebrations like the Thai New Year in April, he helped out, serving guests dressed in ceremonial Thai garb the temple provided.        
At the temple, he met Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, who went on to open the Happy Bowl Thai restaurant in White Settlement in 2011, said the restaurant owner’s cousin, Naree Wilton, 51, in a phone interview. Mr. Alexis helped out at the restaurant in exchange for food and a room in Mr. Suthamtewakul’s house.        
There, he played computer games “at the nighttime and all day,” Ms. Wilton said, on one of three computers he kept in his room, driving up the house’s electricity bills. After he got a job fixing computers, the family asked him to help out with utility bills. He rarely paid and borrowed money often, Ms. Wilton said, complaining that his computer company was withholding pay.

Finally, I have found a kindred spirit in Aaron Hirsh (“The Pop! of the Wild,” Op-Ed, Sept. 9).        
Mr. Hirsh puts his finger on the chief deficiency of online education: the absence of creativity that flourishes in a “world that student and teacher investigate together.” Education is not simply the delivery of information but a flowing transaction in which students and teachers grow in reaction to one another, collaboratively creating something new and unforeseen.        
When I teach my music courses, the most thrilling aspects are the spontaneity, the opportunity to be a reflective practitioner responding to ideas and personalities, and the opportunity my students have to exchange opinions and construct knowledge together.

“Exiting the Solar System and Fulfilling a Dream” (front page, Sept. 13) noted Voyager 1’s legacy of having “pumped out never-before-seen images of Jupiter and Saturn” in 1979 and 1980, but added that it hadn’t returned any new pictures since 1990 “because there was no longer much to see.” The time has now come for the magnificent little spacecraft to turn its cameras back toward the Sun and Earth for one final image of the world it has left behind.        
Throughout its history, the space program has provided us with enduring images such as Apollo 8’s 1968 photo “Earthrise,” captured while in orbit around the Moon; Neil Armstrong’s first footprint on the Moon a year later; and Voyager 1’s 1990 “family portrait” mosaic of our solar system, in which Earth appears as a lonely “Pale Blue Dot,” as the photograph is called.        
An image of Earth and our entire solar system, as seen for the first time from beyond the heliosphere, would be another transcendent, iconic image, taken from a perspective that we may not have again in our lifetime.

Your Sept. 11 editorial “The Race to Improve Global Health” rightly points out that we still have a long way to go, particularly in saving mothers’ lives, the aim of the Millennium Development Goal on maternal health and universal access to reproductive health.        
But many people may not realize that the leading causes of maternal death are largely preventable and treatable with inexpensive antibiotics and medicines that can stop postpartum bleeding and life-threatening hypertension and seizures. Even the simplest of supplies — soap and sterile razors — can save the life of a mother as she delivers.        
The tragedy is that these basic, inexpensive supplies — available everywhere and taken for granted in rich countries — are scarce or nonexistent in the poorest ones. Increasing access to basic medicines and clean supplies would save the lives of more than 180,000 women every year, and as many as a third of vulnerable lives could be rescued if women had access to contraception to plan their pregnancies; 222 million women still lack this.        
In the 21st century, no mother should die bringing new life into the world, especially now that we know what to do as we get closer to the deadline of the Millennium Goals.

To the Editor: 
We agree that the United Nations Millennium Development Goals galvanized the world into responding to extreme poverty and chronic health problems, and that more money and intensive effort are needed to achieve the goals that are lagging. However, a greater insistence on good governance and on a new governance goal is essential to achieve current and future development goals.        
It is possible to measure the impact of governance on the number of children in school and on maternal mortality. Our research shows that where bribery is low and where there is transparency in how governments spend money, people have better access to education, health and basic services like clean water. Galvanizing governments around good governance can significantly help to meet the development goals at their halfway mark in 2015 and take us beyond to reach new goals for 2030.

“Is Suburban Sprawl on Its Way Back?” (news analysis, Sunday Review, Sept. 15) questions whether suburban sprawl is on the resurgence. What I know as an urban mayor is that our cities are growing and flourishing, reversing a half-century trend.        
Census Bureau statistics reveal that the country’s urban population grew by 12.1 percent from 2000 to 2010, outpacing the country’s overall growth rate of 9.7 percent. Mayors across America are welcoming this new growth by championing restaurants, galleries and museums. They are making their cities safer, building parks and recreation facilities, and improving public schools so that families stay rather than head for the suburbs like their parents.        
The success of our cities also benefits our suburbs, as those communities adopt successful urban housing policies, like high-density dwellings near train stations and micro-city environments that mirror urban living. So perhaps the headline should have read, “As Our Cities Rise, So Do Our Suburbs.”

To the Editor: 
Never has the case been made more strongly, however inadvertently, for the necessity of the two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict than in Ian S. Lustick’s fantasy about the need to dump the idea (“Two-State Illusion,” Sunday Review, Sept. 15).        
Anyone who cares about the Jewish people and takes into account both the wonderful aspects as well as the immense tragedies of Jewish history must shudder at Mr. Lustick’s willingness to dismiss the existence of the first independent Jewish state in 2,000 years. His argument about what will ensue after the abandonment of the goal of two states is a fancy version of a one-state solution that ends the concept of Jewish self-determination.        
The founding of the modern state of Israel is a profound historical development. Its safety and survival must be nurtured and protected. Yes, the two-state solution is difficult to achieve, but it is the only one that provides opportunity for Palestinian self-determination without abandoning Jewish sovereignty in the land of Israel.        
Mr. Lustick’s essay ultimately reminds us of the need to get moving toward that goal. While there are some in Israel, too, who say there can be no two-state solution, the leadership and vast majority of its people see it as the only solution.        
Unfortunately, Palestinians still have not made that leap primarily because they, like Mr. Lustick, do not place any value on a Jewish state. Indeed, some may conclude that giving up on two states may produce their old goal, the disappearance of Israel, without war, terrorism or boycott.

New York, Sept. 15, 2013        
To the Editor: 
Ian S. Lustick’s essay offers an illogical, unachievable agenda that does no favors either to Israelis or Palestinians.        
Professor Lustick’s comparison of the Israeli-Palestinian situation to efforts by British colonialists to maintain control of Ireland, France’s colonial rule of Algeria and Communist rule in the Soviet Union is off-base. The point of the two-state solution is to end Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory and to fulfill the Palestinian right to self-determination.        
Likewise, the notion that Israelis whose families came from Arab countries would consider themselves Arabs is absurd. They managed to preserve their Jewish identity for 2,000 years in exile. Why would they give it up now? In any case, as Israelis of European origin increasingly marry with the children and grandchildren of families who came from Arab lands, the distinctions between the two are fast eroding.        
The main problem with Professor Lustick’s analysis is that it is a recipe for permanent conflict. Both Israelis and Palestinians want to fulfill their national aspirations in their own country. Neither will be satisfied with less, and the two-state solution remains the only way to achieve that.

Having had my eyes opened by three visits to Israel, I found Ian S. Lustick’s essay refreshingly clear and knowledgeable. Even now, the United States turns a blind eye while Israel continues expansions and brutal military tactics.        
I believe that the whole point of decades of Israeli encroachment onto fertile areas of the West Bank and the imprisonment of Palestinians in Gaza has been to make a viable second state impossible. Mr. Lustick offers a realistic vision of the Mideast today.        
JANET JONES
San Francisco, Sept. 15, 2013        
To the Editor: 
Although “Two-State Illusion” argues against a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, most of the main historical analogies the writer cites demonstrate exactly the opposite outcome.        
In the cases of Ireland, Algeria and the Soviet Union, solutions were created that allowed two (or more) states to exist: Ireland and Britain, Algeria and France, the former Soviet republics and Russia.        
There is, however, one difference with the Israel-Palestine case. None of the other national movements were bent on the ultimate annihilation of the other state with which they were in conflict.        
Even “illusions” can be inspiring and highly adaptive when, as in each of those historical examples, out of respect or simply self-interest, each party basically accepts the right of the other to exist.

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — During the first week of classes at Penn State last month, John Nichols sat in his office in the old wing of the Willard Building, across the lawn from Old Main, fuming about what people have been saying, for two years now, about the university he loves.        


The campus was bustling. The students had returned. This bucolic town’s main drag, College Avenue, had come alive. Stores sold shirts that read, “Billieve” and “O’Brien’s Lions.” Football season was close, and almost everyone seemed excited for Coach Bill O’Brien’s second year.        
Nichols sat behind his large wooden desk, surrounded by four full bookshelves. He has spent 36 years at Penn State. He raised his children here. He is a professor emeritus and a former chairman of the faculty senate. Now he was talking about Jerry Sandusky and Joe Paterno and he was getting angry. He sat up straighter. His eyes bulged. He threw his hands up.        
“Just this last weekend, I was with some of my closest friends in another state,” he said. “Of course the subject always comes up — always comes up. It’s like a scarlet letter. And when I say that most of what you’ve read is not true, they look at you like — even close friends — they look at you like: ‘Are you a Holocaust denier? You’ve drunk the Penn State Kool-Aid. What other conspiracy theory do you have?’        
“Can you imagine the frustration when you know that there’s been a gross mischaracterization of what has happened at Penn State? And that I and my kids who graduated from Penn State, my friends and colleagues here, are going to have to live with being guilty for crimes we did not commit?”        
Nichols is among those in the larger Penn State community — including current and former faculty, alumni and fans — still upset at how the child sexual abuse scandal involving Sandusky, Paterno’s longtime top assistant, was handled by the institution’s leadership. Still upset about the report put forth by the former F.B.I. director Louis J. Freeh that said Paterno and others covered up Sandusky’s crimes. Still upset about the N.C.A.A. sanctions based on the report, and what they say was the “false narrative” perpetuated by the news media. Still upset about how they thought the scandal came to define Penn State unfairly.        
Terry Engelder, a professor of geosciences in his 28th year at Penn State, said in an e-mail that some faculty members were still agitated because “the rush to unfair judgment has done unspeakable damage to the university’s reputation worldwide.”        
The scandal continues to have ripple effects. The university’s board of trustees has authorized Penn State to spend about $60 million to settle about 30 outstanding claims with Sandusky’s victims. The former university president Graham B. Spanier, the former athletic director Tim Curley and the former university vice president Gary Schultz are set to stand trial for their suspected roles in a cover-up of Sandusky’s actions. Sandusky was convicted last year of 45 counts of child sexual abuse and sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. The football team is prohibited from playing in a bowl game for three more seasons, and it has scholarship restrictions that run through the 2017 season.        
Nichols does not want to forget the scandal just yet. He said that the entire university had been implicated in the public’s mind, that it has been accepted as fact that there was a cover-up, he says, without due process.        
Of the five men who are most connected to the scandal, Nichols pointed out, only Sandusky has been convicted. Paterno died last year, and Spanier, Curley and Schultz have yet to stand trial. If they are found not guilty of the charges against them — including perjury, conspiracy and endangering the welfare of children — Nichols said it would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Freeh report, and the N.C.A.A. penalties would have no basis.        
“I think a lot of people — this includes me — are really rooting that they be found not guilty,” he said, because that would start “rolling back the narrative.”        
He sighed. “We would like to think it’d be Duke 2, the Duke lacrosse case, where the truth would finally emerge,” he said. “But I think there’s a growing sense that that’s probably not going to happen.”        
Last year, the faculty senate appointed Nichols to lead a study meant to complement the Freeh report. The study examined the current state of the university and ways to move forward. His report was released in March 2013 to little fanfare. It concluded, in part, that more collaboration and better communication was needed between the board of trustees and the rest of the university.

On Sept. 9, a raging blaze in an abandoned three-story house in the Bronx drew more than a hundred firefighters, took nearly three hours to bring under control and left a charred structure in place of what had been an unloved neighborhood eyesore.        


That seemed to be the end of the story.        
But on Monday, a demolition crew clearing the remains of the boarded-up, graffiti-splotched house at 61 Buchanan Place found a dead body around 10 a.m.        
A few hours later, they found two more.        
The New York Police Department said that all three of the victims — their bodies severely burned, their names and ages unknown — were men. Fire and police officials said that it was not immediately clear whether they had died in the fire, though that appeared to be the likely cause. Officials did not say where in the house the bodies were found.        
How the three men may have come to be inside the derelict building appeared less mysterious, neighbors said: the house had attracted squatters for years.        
“I saw people going into the basement most of the time,” said Shamsun Khalique, 59, who has lived across the street for nearly 35 years. She said she would see groups of men, often intoxicated, coming and going from the house, which abuts a large apartment building on the short street on the edge of Fordham Heights. “They were, like, living there,” Miss Khalique said. “They used to bring this dog outside the basement.”        
 The building was also on the radar of local firefighters as potentially hazardous, said Frank Dwyer, a Fire Department spokesman. So when the fire broke out around 4:30 a.m. and then grew, firefighters battled it from the outside.        
“When you’re dealing with a vacant building, boarded up with known hazards, it’s dangerous anyway — and now it’s on fire,” he said. “You’re not going to put members in danger if there’s no people known to be inside.”        
It is unclear where the fire began, and fire marshals and police arson investigators had been examining its cause even before the bodies were discovered. Now those efforts have been joined by Bronx detectives.        
As for why the three bodies were not found immediately after the fire, Mr. Dwyer said that fire investigators had entered the house after the blaze but had not gone into every room because of structural damage.

By 2034, the Second Avenue subway will wind through Manhattan, the MetroCard will be long dead and few riders will remember an age without countdown clocks.        


But to deliver New York City to this gilded future of transit, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will need a few things.        
In a presentation on Monday at the authority’s headquarters in Midtown, officials briefed board members on a 20-year, $106 billion list to address core capital needs, stretching from 2015 to 2034. The full list, a precursor to the authority’s 2015-19 capital plan, is expected to be published later this month.        
The preview hinted at the authority’s decision-making at a critical moment in its operations: ridership has climbed to the point of overcrowding on some lines; sprawling megaprojects are approaching their completion in the coming years; and parts of the system are still reeling from Hurricane Sandy.        
Many of the possible investments are of a piece with priorities discussed by Thomas F. Prendergast since his confirmation as the authority’s chairman in June: costly, if unsexy, improvements to aging signal systems and communication equipment. More than a quarter of the $68.2 billion in estimated needs for the authority’s New York City Transit division belongs to this category. About one-fifth of the $68.2 billion is to replace subway cars and buses.        
But some items make it clear that the authority has entered a new phase — particularly when compared with long-term plans from decades past, as safety concerns and unreliable service meant that merely “stabilizing the system” was a chief goal, said Stephen A. Berrang, the authority’s director for capital program management.        
The authority’s list of “emerging priorities” now includes improved customer information, like a systemwide network of countdown clocks, which were a focus of a presentation in July on how to attract growing populations of young riders to the transit system. The needs assessment also calls for a successor to the MetroCard system, which transit officials say cannot be maintained beyond 2019, and places an increased focus on stormproofing since Hurricane Sandy. Mr. Berrang said, for instance, that the authority had raised resiliency standards on parts of the infrastructure like cables and power relays since the storm.        
And in what could be a welcome change for Midtown commuters and tourists, the authority has called for “circulation improvements” at the labyrinthine stations in Times Square and Grand Central Terminal.        
The authority said its current signal system allowed 29 trains per hour to run on the Lexington Avenue line. But during many peak periods, only 26 run per hour because crowding often keeps trains in stations longer than expected. The authority’s plan to bring the Long Island Rail Road into Grand Central is expected to introduce additional strain.        
“It creates effectively a train traffic jam,” Mr. Berrang said of the current crowding. The authority said options included adding staircases to improve passenger flow and adding MetroCard turnstiles — which, if the agency has its way, will be outdated in three to five years.

Drilling for shale gas through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, appears to cause smaller leaks of the greenhouse gas methane than the federal government had estimated, and considerably smaller than some critics of shale gas had feared, according to a peer-reviewed study released on Monday.        


The study, conducted by the University of Texas and sponsored by the Environmental Defense Fund and nine petroleum companies, bolsters the contention by advocates of fracking — and some environmental groups as well — that shale gas is cleaner and better than coal, at least until more renewable-energy sources are developed. More than 500 wells were analyzed.        
The Texas study concluded that while the total amount of escaped methane from shale-gas operations was substantial — more than one million tons annually — it was probably less than the Environmental Protection Agency estimated in 2011.        
In particular, it indicated that containment measures captured 99 percent of methane that escaped from new wells being prepared for production, a process known as completion.        
The Environmental Protection Agency has begun to require drillers to control leaks during completions, which are believed to be one of the major sources of methane losses at fracking wells. Although controls will not be required until January 2015, a number of companies already capture escaped gases at wells being prepared for production.        
“Can we control it? Thanks to new E.P.A. regulations coming online, the answer to that is good news,” Eric Pooley, a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, said in an interview.        
The report was published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. With the study, which ran from May through December of last year, the university was the first to conduct detailed examinations of individual drilling sites. It did so with the consent of petroleum companies, which provided about 90 percent of the financing for the study. Previous E.P.A. estimates relied on engineering calculations, and other studies gathered data via aircraft flights over drilling sites.        
The study’s connection to the petroleum industry — among its sponsors and financiers are Shell, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Exxon Mobil and Chevron — may lead some to question its objectivity, some outside experts said. But most said the research and the reputations of the researchers appear solid.        
“Previous studies that have gotten a lot of attention have had red flags jumping out all over them. This one didn’t,” said Michael A. Levi, the director of the program on energy security and climate change at the Council on Foreign Relations. In an e-mailed statement, Shell’s president, Marvin Odum, called the study “a prime example of key groups — that may not have the exact same interests — working collaboratively and taking a science-based approach” to the methane problem.        
Mr. Odum said that collecting actual emissions data, rather than relying on estimates, would “ensure that both improvement efforts and regulatory changes can be focused on the areas that will have the biggest impact.”        
The report comes at a time when shale-gas drilling is growing at a breakneck pace — production, now 30 percent of all United States natural gas, is expected to reach 50 percent by 2040 — but also when the industry is beset by controversy.        
Citizen groups accuse drillers of despoiling streams and water supplies, and suppliers of wrecking local roads with parades of massive trucks. Environmental groups have split sharply over whether to support shale-gas development as a cleaner fuel that will suffice until wind and solar power assume a greater share of the nation’s energy supply.        
The Texas study is the most comprehensive look to date at a contentious issue in the debate over fracking: the extent to which methane leaks during drilling and production offset the environmental benefits of the clean-burning natural gas the wells produce.        
When burned as fuel, methane — the main component of natural gas — is comparatively clean, producing less carbon dioxide than coal and oil. But vented to the air, it is a short-lived but extremely potent greenhouse gas, trapping heat at a much higher rate than carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.        
Such potency means that even a small loss of methane to the air — just 3.4 percent, scientists say — can negate its climate-changing advantage over coal.        
Some previous studies suggested that as much as 7.9 percent of all shale gas was lost to the atmosphere, a figure that included every stage of the gas process, from well to stove or furnace burner.        
The Texas study did not examine potential losses outside the drilling pad. But its conclusion that losses at the well were comparatively low could remove one issue from the debate. The Environmental Defense Fund is leading other research efforts that should address losses elsewhere, including a look at methane leaks in municipal gas-distribution lines.        
The American Petroleum Institute hailed the study’s conclusions, saying in a statement that its own efforts to reduce methane emissions “are paying off.” But while E.P.A.-mandated measures appear to have reduced emissions during well completions, the study also concluded that leaks elsewhere in the fracking process were higher than the E.P.A. had previously estimated.        
Estimates of leaks from chemical pumps, while small, were twice past estimates, while leaks from pneumatic controllers, or valves, were pegged at more than 639,000 tons a year, roughly a third greater. None of those components are currently subject to federal regulation.

Maybe it was not that surprising that William C. Thompson Jr. would come up just shy.        


It was not just that he pulled in far fewer black and Latino votes than his advisers had confidently predicted for him in the recent Democratic primary for mayor. Nor was it that he fell a few thousand votes short, over all, from forcing Bill de Blasio into a runoff, one in which he would have faced long odds anyway.        
Instead, when Mr. Thompson abandoned his quest on Monday, in a disappointing coda to a campaign filled with what ifs over everything from demographics to his message, it presented a microcosm of a dutiful but not-quite-compelling career.        
Whether he was the smart-money pick, as he was this year, or the underdog, as he was when he lost to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2009, Mr. Thompson could never quite concoct the right recipe to parlay his two terms as a steady New York City comptroller into something grander.        
A product of Brooklyn machine politics, Mr. Thompson believed strongly in by-the-book tactics, like gathering institutional endorsements. Yet he never led in a single poll. He never surged or collapsed, unlike some of his rivals. And despite campaigning for 24 hours straight, not once, but twice, in the past six weeks, the mild-mannered Mr. Thompson could never convince voters that he had enough political thunder.        
“He is a very smart, very talented public servant who has done everything people would want him to do, but it always seems like it’s not enough,” said Basil A. Smikle Jr., a Democratic consultant who teaches at Columbia University and the City University of New York.        
Even on the eve of the primary, Mr. Thompson struggled to connect with voters who should have been in his column. At a deli on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, he had just uttered a quick hello and reminded people about Election Day when Stephon Zephyr said: “Excuse me, Big Guy, you running for mayor?”        
Mr. Thompson, surprised, said yes. Then, in barely audible tones, he talked to Mr. Zephyr, a 26-year-old plumber, for five minutes, about jobs and gun violence. After Mr. Thompson left, Mr. Zephyr shrugged: “He sounds good, but he didn’t say much. He just brushed me off.”        
On paper, Mr. Thompson entered the campaign with many advantages. He had won the admiration of Democrats for coming closer than expected to unseating Mr. Bloomberg four years ago. And in a city where minorities are now the majority, Mr. Thompson, the son and namesake of a respected judge and former legislator, stood out as the only black candidate, with a long résumé in both the public and private sectors.        
Counting on demographics to give him an edge, Mr. Thompson amassed an impressive list of endorsements: party stalwarts like Fernando Ferrer; fiscal watchdogs (Richard Ravitch); black pastors who had backed Mr. Bloomberg in 2009 (former Representative Floyd H. Flake); and key unions (the United Federation of Teachers). One of his biggest fund-raisers was former Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato, the Republican power broker.        
Together, they argued that Mr. Thompson, who at 60 was the oldest major Democratic contender, had the best experience and the temperament to govern.        
But his establishment-friendly strategy had blind spots, according to more than a dozen people, both affiliated with and independent of the campaign.        
“Billy Thompson is as decent a man as you will find in New York City politics,” said Neal Kwatra, a Democratic consultant who did not work for any mayoral candidate. “But Billy and his team were captives of a bygone era of coalition and identity politics.”        
Foremost was the assumption that people had cast a pro-Thompson vote in 2009, rather than an anti-Bloomberg one. Nor did Mr. Thompson take seriously the theory that Mr. Bloomberg’s margin might have been diminished because some of his supporters, anticipating a blowout, did not bother to vote.        
Those assumptions may have given Mr. Thompson a false sense of security, even as he faded from public view for three years.        
“He showed up thinking, ‘Well, now, it’s my turn, because you guys like me, you really like me,’ ” said Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham. “But a lot of New Yorkers seemed to say, ‘I can’t remember who you are.’ ”        
Another problem was that Mr. Thompson never articulated a clear message. “Muddled” was a word used by many.        
He developed a centrist platform, better suited to a general election than a Democratic primary, opposing tax increases while Mr. de Blasio hammered away at income inequality. His thread-the-needle position on the stop-and-frisk police tactics, in particular, exasperated many minorities and liberals. By contrast, Mr. de Blasio positioned himself as the tactics’ fiercest critic.

SAN FRANCISCO — With Emirates Team New Zealand holding a huge lead heading into the final stages of the America’s Cup, it remains unclear just what the team will do with the competition if it goes on to defeat Oracle Team USA.        


Will racing be in multihulls again or in monohulls? In big boats again or in smaller boats? Close to the shore again or back in the heart of Auckland’s vast Hauraki Gulf?        
But Grant Dalton, the combative managing director of Team New Zealand, has made two things clear. He wants the cost of competing in the next edition of the Cup to be considerably less expensive in order to attract more teams. He also wants to restore a nationality rule.        
The nationality debate has long been contentious in the Cup. For now, hulls must be manufactured in the nation of the challenging yacht club, but there is no nationality restriction on sailors involved. That is why Oracle, which represents San Francisco’s Golden Gate Yacht Club and the United States, can compete with just one American — Rome Kirby — on its 11-man crew, which featured sailors of seven nationalities in Sunday’s races.        
This is in keeping with the owner Larry Ellison’s global approach to talent recruitment and with the prevailing recent view that America’s Cup teams are closest in spirit to motor racing’s Formula One teams: more about brand identity and pushing technological boundaries than about national identity and a patriotic agenda.        
“I love America, and I love to say that my family is American,” said James Spithill, Oracle’s Australian helmsman and skipper, who is married to an American. Spithill added: “But I tell you what, I’m not going to try to hide from the fact that we have different nationalities in our team, because I’m proud of every one of them and the ideas and creativity they bring.”        
Dalton and Team New Zealand have a different vision. Nine of their starting crew members are New Zealanders; the other two are Australians with strong New Zealand connections.        
“It’s a very homogeneous crew, while Ellison’s got an international free-agency crew,” said Gary Jobson, the American who won the 1977 America’s Cup as tactician to Ted Turner and is now a television analyst. “I strongly believe that the America’s Cup Deed of Gift was written as a friendly competition between foreign countries, and I think the American boat should have all Americans, the New Zealand boat ought to have all Kiwis, and the French boat should have all French. And if you did that, I think the America’s Cup would mean a lot more to a lot of people.”        
New Zealand, with a population of about 4.4 million, has long punched well above its demographic weight in the sailing world. New Zealanders have been fixtures on nearly all the major teams in the past four Cup cycles. Oracle also has a strong Kiwi influence. Russell Coutts, the team’s chief executive and former skipper, is a New Zealander.        
The imposition of nationality restrictions would presumably cost Kiwis some sailing jobs, as well. But Dalton says he is convinced that the event needs to tack away from the billionaire-versus-billionaire approach that has been back in vogue in the last decade.        
“We stand for a strong nationality rule,” he said earlier this year in an occasionally testy onstage debate with Coutts in New Zealand.        
The question is how strong a rule. Fulfilling Jobson’s vision and creating full Olympic-style national teams would probably discourage teams from emerging sailing nations like China and South Korea. Their home-country sailors simply could not be competitive against the established powers.        
“Grant Dalton’s idea, from what I understand after talking to him, would be to have a weaker nationality rule for newcomers, for new countries, which seems fair,” said Bruno Troublé, a French former America’s Cup helmsman.        
But established teams could also struggle with a new rule. Artemis Racing, which represents the Royal Swedish Yacht Club, had no Swedish sailor on its primary crew during this year’s Challenger Series.

ATLANTA — A former college football player shot to death while searching for help after a car accident was killed by 10 bullets fired by a Charlotte, N.C., police officer, officials said Monday.        


The death of Jonathan Ferrell, 24, led civil rights groups to question the kind of training that resulted in the barrage of bullets fired against an unarmed man by a 27-year-old officer promoted two years ago from the animal control division.        
After a tearful meeting with Chief Rodney Moore of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, Mr. Ferrell’s mother applauded the city for quickly charging the officer who fired the shots with voluntary manslaughter.        
The police said the officer, Randall Kerrick, 27, fired 12 bullets, 10 of which hit Mr. Ferrell as he ran toward Officer Kerrick and two other officers, apparently asking for help.        
“There is no justification of it and, frankly, to the chief’s credit, he didn’t offer one,” said Chris Chestnut, the family’s lawyer. “This is a bad cop in an otherwise respectable police department.”        
Mr. Ferrell, a former safety with Florida A&M University, had recently moved to Charlotte to be with his fiancée, a woman he had been dating since high school. He was working two retail jobs and thinking about going back to school.        
Around 2 a.m. Saturday, after he dropped a friend off in a quiet Charlotte subdivision, his car went off the road into dense woods in an area where the speed limit is 25 miles per hour.        
The car was so badly damaged that Mr. Ferrell had to climb out a rear window. He staggered up an embankment to the road, knocking on the first door he could find on Reedy Creek Road, according to his family and the police.        
A young woman who thought her husband was coming home from work opened the door. She saw Mr. Ferrell, panicked and called the police.        
Three Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers showed up. Mr. Ferrell ran toward them. A Taser was fired, but it was unclear whether it hit Mr. Ferrell. Then Officer Kerrick fired.        
The woman and the officer are white. Mr. Ferrell was black.        
What caused the crash was not clear. The police said there was no initial indication that alcohol was involved, although toxicology test results have not been released.        
On Tuesday, Officer Kerrick will face arraignment on voluntary manslaughter charges, according to the Mecklenburg County Clerk of Court. It was the first time in more than three decades that an officer from the department has been charged in an on-duty shooting. Mr. Ferrell was the sixth person shot by an officer in the department since 2012.        
Mr. Ferrell was described as a sweet, introspective man, dedicated to football but also someone who wanted nothing more than to work hard and spend time with the woman to whom he had recently become engaged.        
Mr. Ferrell’s family, friends and former coaches spoke out on Monday, offering a portrait of a man who had the best interest of others at heart.        
“He didn’t disrespect nobody,” Willie Ferrell said of his brother. He was only 16 months younger than Jonathan, and the two were best friends. His older brother taught him everything, he said, from how to tie his shoes to how to play football.        
“He was a man of all men,” Willie Ferrell said. “There was nothing that was hard for him to do.”        
Mr. Ferrell’s family, who had traveled to Charlotte from Tallahassee, Fla., spoke of forgiveness but would not say whether they thought a more severe charge should have been leveled.        
“I won’t opine on that, but I will tell you this isn’t a Charlotte Police Department problem,” Mr. Chestnut said. “It’s a glaring example that there are folks with guns and badges in America that lack discernment and intelligence and judgment.”        
The department’s quick move to bring charges, he said, was influenced by the 2012 shooting death in Florida of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African-American.        
“Trayvon Martin was a recipe for what not to do,” he said.        
On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union and the N.A.A.C.P. questioned the kind of training that could produce an officer who would use deadly force in Mr. Ferrell’s circumstances and called for the department to change its police review board system and make video taken by the police during calls public record.        
On Monday, as Georgia Ferrell spoke about her son to reporters, she held his childhood Winnie the Pooh doll and described a boy who loved animals and promised her that he would one day give her grandchildren.        
Later, in a telephone interview, she said the family had yet to decide if it would take legal action. Instead, she was praying for forgiveness.        
“He took my son from me, but I can only stand here and tell you that I believe God is the one listening to me right now and God would want me to forgive,” she said. “If I don’t forgive, it will be on me forever.”

Sheldon Hackney, an educator and chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities who organized a series of “national conversations” aimed at restoring civility and civic-mindedness during the culturally fractious 1990s, died on Thursday on Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. He was 79.        


The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, said his wife, Lucy Durr Hackney.        
Mr. Hackney had been president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1981 to 1993 when President Bill Clinton appointed him chairman of the endowment. His defining initiative in the job was his first: “A National Conversation on American Pluralism and Identity,” a project that helped finance and shape about 1,400 public meetings from 1994 to 1997.        
In discussions held in libraries, college auditoriums and town halls in all 50 states — some televised, most not — citizens discussed what it meant to be an American at the height of the so-called culture wars, when the idea of “one nation, indivisible” seemed threatened by ideological and religious divisions over issues like abortion, homosexuality, multiculturalism and the separation of church and state, as well as racial tensions as seen in the polarized public reaction to O. J. Simpson’s murder trial and acquittal, a response that troubled Mr. Hackney.        
Mr. Hackney brought a historian’s perspective to the project. His award-winning 1969 book, “Populism to Progressivism in Alabama,” established him as one of the foremost historians of the post-Civil War South.        
At the University of Pennsylvania he became identified with two highly publicized campus disputes involving alleged racial incidents. Mr. Hackney was portrayed as having sided with the black students in both cases, one involving epithets against women in a black sorority and the other concerning black students who had confiscated copies of a campus newspaper over an article they considered offensive.        
Though the details of the events and his actions in handling them remained disputed, his portrayal as the personification of the “politically correct” academic leader later became the focus of Congressional opposition to his nomination to head the National Endowment for the Humanities. He was confirmed anyway.        
But after Republicans won control of Congress in the 1994 elections, Mr. Hackney’s budget was cut to $110 million, from $172 million the previous year.        
“I was a true veteran of the multicultural wars,” he said in an interview. “If they gave out Purple Hearts for wounds incurred while trapped between the front lines, I would have several.”        
Francis Sheldon Hackney was born in Birmingham, Ala., on Dec. 5, 1933, the son of Cecil Fain Hackney and the former Elizabeth Morris. Throughout the 1930s, his father found steady work as a newspaper reporter and editor for The Birmingham Age-Herald. He completed his master’s degree and Ph.D. in history at Yale, where he was a protégé of C. Vann Woodward, considered the dean of Southern historians.        
Mr. Hackney was an assistant professor and then a tenured professor of history at Princeton from 1965 until 1972, when he became provost there. From 1975 to 1980 he was president of Tulane University in New Orleans. He returned to teaching at Penn after leaving the endowment.        
Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Fain Hackney; a daughter, Elizabeth McBride; three brothers, Morris, Rob and John; and eight grandchildren. A daughter, Virginia, died several years ago.        
Though the “conversations” begun by Mr. Hackney were not highly publicized and not particularly popular on the right or the left for different reasons, he remained loyal to his ideas.        
In “One America, Indivisible,” a 1997 book about the National Conversation project, Mr. Hackney said he was concerned about the country’s political atmosphere. “I worry that rights-based individualism on the Left, and market-driven libertarianism on the Right, will leave insufficient room for a common vision of the common good.”        
The conversation Americans still needed to have, he said, might be framed as a question: “The question absent from our national catechism,” he said, “is, ‘What do I owe to my fellow citizens?’ ”

The University of Alabama said on Monday that its traditionally white sororities had been ordered to extend their recruitment efforts after the school came under withering criticism for racial bias by its Greek organizations. The university said in a statement that President Judy L. Bonner had told the social groups to use a process that allows the organizations to accept new members after the traditional sorority rush as part of a push “to remove barriers in order to increase diversity in our sororities.” The university drew attention last week after a member of the Tuscaloosa campus’s Alpha Gamma Delta chapter told the student newspaper, The Crimson White, that the sorority had considered race when it denied admission to a black woman with a sterling academic record and close familial ties to Alabama. Members of other sororities recounted similar experiences, though they did so anonymously.

FRONT PAGE  
An article on Friday about the declining influence of the exiled Pakistani political leader Altaf Hussain misstated the given name of his cousin and personal assistant who was arrested in June by Scotland Yard and who is now out on bail. He is Iftikhar Hussain, not Ishtiaq.        
INTERNATIONAL 
A report on Saturday in the World Briefing column about a decision by President Michel Djotodia of the Central African Republic to dismiss the rebel group known as the Selaka coalition, which had swept to power in March and installed him in office, carried an erroneous credit. The article was by The Associated Press, not by Reuters.        
BUSINESS DAY 
Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about Albritton Communications’ plans to recast the Web publication Capital New York in the image of Politico, its Washington news site, misspelled the surname of the Politico media reporter who has begun posting news to Capital New York. He is Dylan Byers, not Byars.

The Off the Charts column on Saturday, about optimism among investors that Europe’s situation is improving, misidentified the German political party that formed a coalition with the Christian Democrats, Angela Merkel’s party. It is the Free Democrats, not the Liberal Democrats.        
THE ARTS 
An article and headlines on Saturday about the Istanbul Biennial described it incorrectly. It is an exhibition in which artists are invited to show works; it is not an art fair, a commercial venture in which galleries pay fees and display works for sale. The article also misstated the title of the show. It is “Mom, Am I Barbarian?” not “Mom, Am I a Barbarian?”

Culture,"







                            “Women or Nothing,” the new comedy by the filmmaker Ethan Coen, feels like a short play that has been heavily padded. (Perhaps this should not be a surprise: Mr. Coen has written several one-acts, but this is his first full-length stage work.) Somewhere inside this bloated comedy, about two lesbians in search of some viable sperm, there may be a skinny sex farce struggling to break free.        


                            Was that too much information for an opening paragraph? The word “sperm” can be a little startling over morning coffee, or, for that matter, an evening cocktail. Sorry about that, but the play, which opened on Monday at the Atlantic Theater Company in a production directed by David Cromer, rests entirely on the leading characters’ improbable quest for this substance.        

                            Soon after the lights go up on an enviably chic New York apartment, we find Gretchen (Halley Feiffer) bustling around the shelves stocked with art books and expensive-looking gewgaws, removing select photographs and tucking them away in a closet. When her partner, Laura (Susan Pourfar), arrives home, they have a slightly tense argument about the plan Gretchen has hatched to help them have a baby.        

                            Scorning the anonymity of sperm banks and the potential lack of rigor involved in their screening processes, Gretchen has decided to recruit a viable donor herself. The twist is, he’s being volunteered involuntarily: the colleague she’s deemed genetically desirable for their purposes won’t know that he’s being used. This doesn’t sit well with Laura, a concert pianist with a rather more stringent ethical sense than Gretchen, who is a lawyer.        

                            “What is it that makes us human?” Laura loftily asks. (Ms. Pourfar employs a rather grand-sounding accent.) “It’s knowing what we’re doing, choosing what we’re doing.”        

                            Gretchen, played by Ms. Feiffer with perky energy, breezily dismisses her qualms, and continues preparing to set the trap she’s laid, although since only Laura can conceive, she’s the one who will be doing the seducing over a casual dinner. (Gretchen plans to run late and then call to cancel.) Mr. Coen elicits some biting humor from their gentle tussle over the subject, as when Laura learns that the donor has been selected, in part, because he happens to be moving to Florida soon.        

                            “I would not sleep with a normal man,” Laura says. “How could I sleep with a man who wants to live in Florida?”        

                            Their long scene of tart exchanges about the merits of sperm banks versus “room service,” as Laura calls it, leads to gradual rapprochement. Unfortunately, this talky scene also leaves the audience with lots of time to ponder the absurdities of their enterprise. Laura may be resigned to her role, but we, on the other side of the proverbial footlights, may still have some reservations.        

                            Are the women so unaware of the physiology of insemination that they imagine that a single encounter with a man will necessarily achieve the desired result? (This is particularly germane, given Laura’s age: 40.) Since Laura has never slept with a man — she’s a “gold star lesbian,” she says later — does she make a likely one-shot man trap?        

                            In any case, men who sleep around are likely to ponder potential consequences when they are contemplating sex. At no point does anyone mention the possibility of their guinea pig’s requesting a condom. And many lesbian couples who are also wary of sperm banks choose a good friend to donate, in a less intimate (and less chancey) manner, an option that goes unmentioned here.        

                            Willing suspension of disbelief is, of course, often a prerequisite at the theater. But when the superstructure of the plot is founded on a notion as rickety as the one driving “Women or Nothing,” it’s hard not to feel disengaged.        

                            My objections were hardly put to rest when the donor himself arrived in the play’s second scene. The lanky, handsome but bookish-looking Chuck (Robert Beitzel) hardly seems the kind of heedless, priapic guy who would chase any skirt. The nervous Laura begins downing cocktails, and plying Chuck with same, but their conversation is high-minded: Laura’s cynicism about her career (“I’m a brand name now,” she says, “I’m Burma Shave.”) is countered by Chuck’s assertion that her art no doubt touches an audience. Soon they are finding common ground in meandering talk of manners and morals, but the comic potential in this unlikely seduction goes unrealized.

TORONTO — The history of baseball is full of famous collapses that enabled teams to qualify for the playoffs against all expectations. The 1978 Red Sox, the 1964 Phillies and the 2007 Mets are but a few whose collapses paved the way for more fortunate teams.        


But if the Yankees are to earn one of the two American League wild-card spots, it will probably require one of baseball’s greatest multiteam collapses.        
But, as Alex Rodriguez said after Sunday’s ugly 9-2 loss to Boston, “You never know, crazier things have happened.”        
The final two weeks of the regular season would have to be particularly crazy for things to break the Yankees’ way.        
As of Monday morning, there were six teams with a chance at the two wild-card spots, and myriad circumstances to get two of those teams into the playoffs. A week ago, the Yankees were in position to control their own fate. In fact they did, by losing.        
After being swept by the Red Sox this past weekend, the Yankees could still miss the playoffs even if they win the rest of their games. But their playoff hopes remain alive.        
“The only thing we can do is go out and play and win the games that we are in,” C. C. Sabathia said. “Obviously, we need a little help. But if we don’t win, that help won’t even matter. We need to win most of the rest of the games we are playing, and then see what happens.”        
The Yankees, who were off Monday, have 12 games left. They are 79-71 and were three games behind the Tampa Bay Rays and the Texas Rangers, the leaders in the A.L. wild-card race entering Monday’s games. The Rangers visited the Rays on Monday to begin a four-game series.        
The Cleveland Indians began a three-game series at Kansas City. The outcome of that series is also important because the Indians were two and a half games ahead of the Yankees, and the Royals were a half-game behind them.        
“I know we are right in the mix,” Rodriguez said. “It’s nothing that a two- or three-game winning streak can’t fix. If we go out and win four of the next five starting Tuesday, I think we are right back in this thing. If you take Boston away over the last two or three weeks, we’ve played pretty good baseball.”        
The Orioles are a half-game ahead of the Yankees, but they have the unenviable task of playing the Red Sox six more times.        
If the Rays win three of the four games against Texas this week and the Yankees sweep the Blue Jays — which will not be easy because the Blue Jays have R. A. Dickey pitching Tuesday — the Yankees will be one game behind Texas in the loss column and three behind the Rays. But they have three games left against the Rays at Yankee Stadium.        
The Indians have been playing well recently, but the struggles of the Rangers and the Rays have given the Yankees reason to believe, even after their dismal showing in Boston.        
“I don’t stop believing,” Manager Joe Girardi said. “We’re not the only team that’s ran into hard times in the month of September and August. There’s other teams that have run into hard times, too. We still have a great opportunity. Yeah, we have to win a lot of games, but the opportunity is in front of us.”        
The Rangers went into Monday’s game having lost 6 straight and 9 of their previous 10. The Rays had lost 14 of their previous 21 games. The Yankees, on the other hand, have just completed the hardest part of their schedule, against the Red Sox.        
They have three more at Toronto, and then three at home against the San Francisco Giants and three against the Rays before they head to Houston for three against the Astros, who have the worst record in baseball.        
“Every day is a new opportunity for us,” said Phil Hughes, who is back in the rotation and scheduled to pitch Wednesday in Toronto. “I feel good about it. I feel like the schedule could work in our favor, provided we win. Right now there’s a lot of teams that have their eye on the wild card. It’s a dogfight.”

There were Liberty gold coins and Krugerrands, and a gold chain so thick that had it been used as a restraining device, it might have done a fair job of keeping Tom Eli behind bars.        


But the purpose of the gold baubles, chain included, was exactly the opposite: Mr. Eli’s Romany family sought to use them as collateral for his $50,000 bail, to secure his release from Rikers Island.        
And therein lay the reason for an unusual hearing on Monday at State Supreme Court in Manhattan, as prosecutors sought to challenge the provenance of the jewelry.        
Mr. Eli’s lawyer grew indignant that his client had to spend another night on Rikers simply because the judge was not convinced that the man’s family had obtained the pile of gold lawfully.        
With the defendant’s mother, a 72-year-old retired carnival worker and part-time palm reader, still sitting in the witness box, the judge firmly reminded the lawyer that a prior associate of the defendant’s showed up with $50,000 in cash to cover the bail, but changed his mind when he learned that there would be such a hearing.        
“Poof, he disappeared,” said the judge, Charles H. Solomon. “So something’s fishy, obviously. That certainly makes me suspicious.”        
Prosecutors say Mr. Eli, 41, slashed a man outside 230 Fifth, a nightclub in the Flatiron district, on April 14.        
Mr. Eli’s lawyer, Thomas A. Kenniff, waged an anthropological argument: After centuries of being chased from country to country, the Roma, sometimes called Gypsies, have developed an aversion to traditional institutions, including banks, and have their own internal economy. He said he feared that his client was being treated differently from similarly situated people because of his background.        
Mr. Kenniff called to the stand Dr. Ruth Andersen, who has studied the Romany people since the 1970s, and said that many who live in the United States still follow ancient traditions, including passing down gold coins and necklaces as heirlooms, and owning those pieces communally.        
“Their gold is heirloom gold,” Dr. Andersen said. “If someone was desperate and had to sell the gold for money, they would be heartbroken. There are many Romany people who would sooner starve.”        
Next came the defendant’s mother, Lulu Eli Costello, who testified that she had obtained the jewelry from various relatives at her wedding in 1962 and from the in-laws of her sons when they married through the years.        
“I hold on to them, like security,” she said.        
She said she was born in Jasper, Tex., and then moved around a lot. She began working at fairs and carnivals, in games and concessions, when she married.        
“We used to cover a lot of states, all over,” she said. “Every week was in a different spot.”        
But the prosecutor in the case, Michael Pasinkoff, sought to characterize the family as less than trustworthy. He asked Mrs. Costello about the arrests of several members of her family, reaching all the way back to her father’s arrest on attempted murder charges in 1972, and also mentioned that the son in jail has a violent felony conviction.        
Mr. Pasinkoff then showed Mrs. Costello a legal complaint he said she signed against her granddaughter five years ago, accusing the young woman of stealing $30,000 in jewelry from her. Ms. Costello said she did not recognize the complaint.        
“I don’t know what it is, and I don’t know where it comes from,” she said. “My granddaughter is a very good girl.”

FRANKFURT — The real political drama in Germany this year may get under way only after Chancellor Angela Merkel faces the voters.        


As state elections in Bavaria underlined on Sunday, Ms. Merkel’s personal popularity conceals a high degree of political fragmentation. That could make it tricky for her to assemble a governing coalition, especially if her center-right Christian Democratic Party performs the way polls suggest, winning this Sunday’s national election but falling short of an outright majority.        
Her current coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, did so poorly in the Bavarian election that it might emerge from the national vote with no seats. That could force Ms. Merkel, who is seeking a third term, to make a power-sharing deal with the main opposition party, the more left-leaning Social Democrats.        
Meanwhile, pop-up parties — notably the anti-euro Alternative for Germany — have occupied political space vacated by Ms. Merkel as she moved left on issues like a national minimum wage and nuclear power.        
The situation underlines the major role that small parties can play in German politics and the growing willingness of German voters to switch from one party to another.        
“It used to be that 30 percent of the voters would vote for the Christian Democrats no matter what the party said or did,” said Stephan Werhahn, a grandson of Konrad Adenauer, the country’s first postwar chancellor.        
“Today the voters orient themselves according to their personal interests,” said Mr. Werhahn, a Munich lawyer who himself defected from the Christian Democrats to a minor party last year but then returned this year. “The parties have had to take over more issues that are not in harmony with their basic principles, in order to attract these voters.”        
German politics are still much more orderly than in some other European countries, like Italy and Greece. Still, Germany’s level of voter unrest is puzzling given that the country has not suffered nearly as much from the euro crisis. Unemployment here is near record lows.        
“The situation in Germany is still very different from Italy or Greece, which are really under strain,” said Thomas Harjes, chief economist at Barclays Germany. He said some voters might feel a sense of powerlessness in the face of global forces that breeds disillusion with mainstream parties.        
No party has felt the new fickleness of voters more acutely than the pro-business Free Democrats, long a fixture in the country’s postwar politics. Just four years after winning almost 15 percent in the national vote, they are at risk of falling short of the 5 percent needed to field a delegation to the national Parliament.        
If they do fail, Ms. Merkel may need to form a so-called grand coalition with the Social Democrats. She could then have to balance their left-leaning demands with the right wing of her own party, which is already grumpy about her support for euro zone bailouts, even as citizens of receiving countries have excoriated her insistence on austerity.        
Some of her disgruntled party members have even defected to Alternative for Germany.        
One is Karl-Georg Glehn, a lawyer from Cologne who was one of several hundred people in Frankfurt on Saturday to attend an Alternative rally in front of city hall. “We’re liable for billions from the Greek economy, which is bankrupt, cronyistic and corrupt,” he said. “They would be better off with their own currency. Merkel is silent on all these problems.”        
Alternative for Germany is the wild card in Sunday’s elections. It fielded no candidates in Bavaria, but its voters are regarded as highly committed and likely to vote, and polls show the party could come close to winning enough votes nationally to get seats in Parliament.        
“I have a feeling there is an undercurrent of sympathy that is being underestimated,” said Christian Meurer, a political satirist and author of a recent book, “The Wackos Who Are Governing Us” (“Die Irren, die uns Regieren”).        
Seats in Parliament would give the Alternative party a soapbox in Berlin and allow it to play a disruptive role in debates about European policy, while making it harder for Ms. Merkel to muster a majority. “The headlines these debates will generate will be very harmful,” said Mr. Harjes, the economist.        
Ms. Merkel will also have to contend with the Christian Democrats’ sister party, the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, which is feeling its oats after a commanding victory last Sunday. The party, which normally does not field candidates outside Bavaria, won enough votes to form a state government by itself. Predominantly Roman Catholic, it is more conservative on many issues than the Christian Democrats, and will probably demand a substantial number of cabinet posts as payment for Bavaria’s support in Parliament.        
In a sense, the Free Democrats’ unexpectedly strong showing nationally four years ago, when they won 14.6 percent, wound up contributing to their steep decline. Despite holding several cabinet posts, they were unable to deliver promised tax overhauls — Ms. Merkel preferred to focus on cutting debt. And Free Democrat leaders fought among themselves.        
“It was our own fault,” said Jörg-Uwe Hahn, the minister of justice in the state of Hessen, who is also a member of the Free Democrats’ national governing body. “On the core issue, taxes, the party didn’t deliver quickly and decisively enough.”        
Mr. Hahn said, though, that he was optimistic the Free Democrats would win the 5 percent of the national vote needed to get into Parliament. When the party has been in trouble in the past, Christian Democrats often crossed over to make sure it could be a coalition partner.        
Karl-Heinz Paqué, an economist who was formerly leader of the Free Democrat delegation in the Saxony-Anhalt State Parliament, said it was inconceivable that the party would be excluded from national politics.        
“The F.D.P. is part of German history,” he said.

GREENBURGH, N.Y. — Rangers defenseman Marc Staal and center Dominic Moore are approaching the season from drastically different perspectives of redemption.        


For Staal, the challenge is physical — recovering from a serious eye injury sustained last season after a concussion-shortened 2011-12 season.        
Staal, 26, said he was accustomed to wearing a tinted visor for the first time in his career and feeling good after nearly a week of training camp.        
“It’s all about going day by day and getting better,” said Staal, who played regular shifts during Monday’s preseason opener in Newark, where the Devils beat the Rangers, 2-1. “I’m excited to be playing games, excited to be back. I just keep working.”        
Staal was struck near the right eye by a puck against Philadelphia on March 5. He missed the last 27 regular-season games and played in one playoff game. He spent the summer skating with his three brothers — Eric, Jordan and Jared of the Carolina Hurricanes — and attended Team Canada’s Olympic orientation camp.        
The previous season, Staal sustained a concussion in a collision with Eric during a game and missed 46 games. Staal, who paired with Michael Del Zotto against the Devils, is not one to complain even with a right eye permanently dilated.        
“Am I nervous? Not really,” Staal said. “Maybe I am more conscious of what I’m doing out there and trying to get better. I know I have a lot of work ahead.”        
Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault said he was encouraged by Staal’s performance.        
“He was a little anxious, and rightfully so,” Vigneault said. “He didn’t give up on pucks, talked to his partner all night long. It’s only going to get better for Mark.”        
The path back for Moore, a gritty 33-year-old center, is wholly different. Moore, who scored the Rangers’ goal Monday, skipped all of last season after his wife, Katie, died last January from liver cancer. Moore last played for San Jose at the end of the 2011-12 season after he was traded from Tampa Bay late that season.        
“You’re a little bit unsure because you haven’t played in so long,” Moore said, adding: “I feel good, I feel strong, I feel fast. The timing will come.”        
Moore broke into the N.H.L. with the Rangers, who picked him in the third round of the 2000 draft out of Harvard. He was a key member of the 2005-6 Tom Renney-coached squad that surprised the league with 100 points after the season-canceling 2004-5 lockout. Moore centered a hard-working line with Colton Orr on right wing and Ryan Hollweg on the left.        
The Rangers traded him in July 2006 to Nashville, which immediately shipped him to Pittsburgh. After 59 games with the Penguins, Moore was traded to Minnesota and later skated for Toronto, Buffalo, Florida, Montreal, Tampa Bay and San Jose. He was a valuable playoff performer for the Canadiens in 2010 and the Lightning in 2011 as both teams reached the Eastern Conference finals.        
Moore recalled his first training camp with the Rangers 13 years ago when he crossed paths with Adam Graves, who was playing his final season.        
“I remember how Adam came around and talked to all the young guys, tapping on our shin pads and telling us we were doing a great job,” Moore said. “That kind of support was tremendous and I hope I can help the young players here now as a veteran.”        
A vital member of the Rangers’ 1994 Stanley Cup-winning team, Graves said it was meaningful to have a player of Moore’s caliber on the current squad.        
“You can’t say enough about his dedication, work ethic and the quality person he is,” said Graves, who is in charge of hockey and business operations for the Rangers. “He’s the type of player everyone can learn from.”        
Moore said he was particularly looking forward to reuniting with the All-Star goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, a fellow Rangers rookie in 2005-6.        
“Obviously, those are special times when you are first breaking in,” said Moore, who centered a line with the youngsters Brandon Mashinter on left wing and Shawn O’Donnell on the right against the Devils. “That year, we showed what’s possible when a team is on the same page. I feel we can have the same potential this season.”

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Dee Milliner made a few mental miscues, and his coach, infuriated, yanked him from the game. This occurred Thursday night against the Patriots. It also happened three years ago, in Milliner’s freshman season at Alabama.        


They were “simple mistakes” then, he said, just as they were in the first half of the Jets’ 13-10 loss to New England. Milliner rebounded to earn a cornerback spot on the Southeastern Conference’s all-freshman team. He has 14 games to make a similar recovery with the Jets, but his immediate future is uncertain.        
Milliner seemed to understand his current predicament, why Coach Rex Ryan remains noncommittal on whether Milliner will regain his starting role for Sunday’s game against Buffalo.        
“You know you’re going to go through struggles, no matter if you’re young or whatever you are,” Milliner said. “So you’ve just got to get through it.”        
As a freshman at Alabama, Milliner did, in large part because injuries and graduation gutted the Crimson Tide’s secondary, requiring him to learn on the job. The Jets, after drafting him ninth over all, believe in his potential, but, as Ryan said Monday, “We’ve got to do what’s best for us.”        
If Milliner does not start on Sunday, he is still likely to play. But any reduction in playing time could be viewed as an acknowledgment that he was not ready to assume the responsibilities that the Jets heaped on him. Despite missing their off-season program because of shoulder surgery; three days of full-squad workouts after staging a weeklong holdout from training camp; and the final two preseason games because of injury, Milliner was listed atop their first depth chart, ahead of Kyle Wilson, who drew raves from Ryan throughout the off-season.        
“We were comfortable with him physically, there was no question we were,” Ryan said of Milliner. “Now did he miss a lot of time? He absolutely did. We thought he could handle it. But again, it’s not that I’m totally ‘Oh, hey, he’s failed.’ That’s not the case. We have to correct a few things.”        
Milliner struggled in the season opener against Tampa Bay, showing a lack of awareness on a 17-yard touchdown catch by Mike Williams. Precisely what caused his benching against New England remains unclear, but he appeared to be at fault during the broken coverage that yielded Aaron Dobson’s 39-yard touchdown reception, and he benefited from video replay overruling a touchdown by Kenbrell Thompkins. Milliner hinted that he was aware of the in-game adjustments he should have made, but was just slow to react.        
The Jets drafted Milliner because of his physical attributes and cover skills. Milliner said the most challenging aspect of his transition to the N.F.L. had been the mental adjustment: analyzing receivers’ tendencies, learning the nuances of coverage schemes. He said film review had been valuable, helping him form a picture of what he did wrong so that he will not make the same mistake twice. It worked for him at Alabama, he said, and so he hopes it will again.        
“I’ve just got to move fast and be alert,” Milliner said.        
SMITH’S OPTION TO RUN It is not that the Jets necessarily want Geno Smith to run more, but they do want him to recognize running opportunities when they arise. Bemoaning his fourth-quarter interception at the Patriots 11, which cost the Jets a chance to at least tie the score, Smith said Monday that on the play, a third-and-4, he should have rushed for the first down instead of trying to squeeze the ball to Santonio Holmes in a tight space.        
“In those times, if need be, I’ve got to tuck the ball down and run,” Smith said.        
After leading the Jets with 47 rushing yards against Tampa Bay, Smith ran three times for 17 yards against New England, including a 16-yard third-quarter scamper on second-and-13. Running is not Smith’s default setting; he considers himself a pocket passer with mobility, looking to throw downfield and then reacting if his options are covered.        
Rex Ryan said, “If it’s taken away from you, then it’s not a bad deal to take off with it.”        
INJURED ARE RETURNING For a team that played twice in five days, the Jets are remarkably healthy. And they are optimistic that defensive lineman Muhammad Wilkerson (right ankle sprain), a linchpin of their defensive front, and receiver Jeremy Kerley (concussion) will be available Sunday against Buffalo. Both returned to practice Monday, as did outside linebacker Quinton Coples, who had ankle surgery a month ago.        
Wilkerson, who hurt his ankle in the fourth quarter against New England, walked around the locker room without any wrap or bandage on his ankle. “Just a little soreness,” he said.        
The Jets missed Kerley against New England, as their receivers dropped four passes. He must complete the league’s concussion protocol before being cleared to play, but he said he did not foresee that as an obstacle.        
“I’ll take care of myself,” Kerley said. “I don’t want to pay for it later down the road.”        
NEW PUNTER The Jets, frustrated with Robert Malone’s inconsistency, switched punters. They signed Ryan Quigley, who competed with Malone during training camp and was released when the Jets cut the roster to 75.

It is a new frontier of the anti-abortion movement: laws banning abortion at 20 weeks after conception, contending that fetuses can feel pain then.         
Since 2010, a dozen states have enacted them, most recently Texas. Nationally, a bill passed the Republican-dominated House of Representatives in June.        
The science of fetal pain is highly complex. Most scientists who have expressed views on the issue have said they believe that if fetuses can feel pain, the neurological wiring is not in place until later, after the time when nearly all abortions occur.        
Several scientists have done research that abortion opponents say shows that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks after conception. One of those scientists said he believed fetuses could likely feel pain then, but he added that he believed the few abortions performed then could be done in ways to avoid pain. He and two other scientists said they did not think their work or current evidence provided scientific support for fetal-pain laws.        
Some scientists’ views have evolved as more research has been done. Dr. Nicholas Fisk, a senior maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital in Australia, said he once considered early fetal pain “a major possibility” after finding that fetuses receiving blood transfusions produced increased stress hormones and blood flow to the brain, and that painkillers lowered those levels.        
But Dr. Fisk, a former president of the International Fetal Medicine and Surgery Society, said neurological research has convinced him that pain “is not possible at all” before 24 weeks.        
Supporters of fetal-pain laws also say that surgeons’ use of anesthesia and painkillers when operating on fetuses in the womb proves fetuses feel pain.        
“If the child who is waiting for surgery can feel pain, the child who is waiting for abortion can also feel pain,” said Mary Spaulding Balch, the National Right to Life Committee’s state policy director, who pioneered fetal-pain laws. She does not advocate performing abortions with anesthesia or painkillers “to have a painless death,” but rather wants those abortions prevented because a “member of the human family has reached a point where they are capable of feeling pain.”        
But fetal surgeons say that the drugs are given for reasons other than fetal pain. Anesthesia is given to the mother, reaching the fetus, said Dr. Scott Adzick, a fetal surgeon at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Fetuses receive muscle relaxants and narcotics. The drugs are given to prevent maternal pain, immobilize the fetus, relax the uterus, and block harmful effects of a fetus’s hormonal stress response, he said. Asked if fetuses would feel pain without these drugs, Dr. Adzick said he did not know.        
Dr. Mark Rosen, who pioneered anesthesia in fetal surgery, said if fetuses could experience surgery-related pain, it would be postoperatively, because during surgery anesthesia from the mother is so strong. Painkillers given to fetuses would prevent postsurgical pain if it exists, but the known scientific reason for them is “it promotes healing,” he said. “The fetus is going to go on and develop and live.”        
Fetal-pain laws usually prohibit abortions at 20 weeks after conception, about 22 weeks gestational age as measured by scientists — from the last menstrual period, since conception cannot be pinpointed. By far most abortions occur before 24 weeks because the Supreme Court has said they may be performed until fetuses can be viable outside the womb, which doctors say is around 24 weeks.        
So the laws banning abortions about two weeks before the 24-week threshold affect very few; 98.5 percent of abortions occur before 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. Later cases often involve just-discovered birth defects.        
Still, both sides consider the laws, which have been challenged and blocked in Arizona, Georgia and Idaho, broader efforts to narrow abortion options and build opposition.        
Scientists with varying views of pain development said they did not consider their work applicable to fetal-pain laws or the highly charged abortion debate.        
For example, one of the main scientists whose work is cited as support for the laws is Dr. Kanwaljeet Anand, a professor of pediatrics, anesthesiology and neurobiology at the University of Tennessee’s Health Science Center. Dr. Anand said he considered fetal pain likely at 18 to 24 weeks. But he added that the “issue of fetal pain does not have much relevance for abortion, since most abortions are performed before the fetus is capable of experiencing pain” and that for the “very few” abortions that occur after that time, techniques could be used that he believed would prevent pain.        
Because so much about pain is undetermined, most scientific discussions eventually run into theoretical territory. Much research involves children or adults, making implications for fetuses unclear. Scientists say characterizing responses as pain is difficult; some fetal reactions are simply reflexes or stress hormones. Some researchers say pain-sensing ability depends on consciousness, which may itself emerge gradually.

CHICAGO — William M. Daley, a former White House chief of staff and a member of one of Chicago’s best-known political families, is dropping his bid to become governor of Illinois, an aide said Monday evening.        


The decision, first reported by The Chicago Tribune, came as a shock in political circles here and threw into uncertainty an expected March Democratic primary against Gov. Pat Quinn. A large field of Republican candidates has lined up to compete for the post, but the decision appeared, for now, to leave Mr. Quinn, who has been seen as vulnerable in part because of the state’s serious fiscal woes, with a far simpler path among Democrats.        
A campaign aide said that Mr. Daley’s experience campaigning in the last few months had left him with questions and doubts.        
“The commitment of a tough campaign and governing to fix everything was just more than what Mr. Daley wanted to do in this stage in his life,” Tom Bowen, his recently named campaign manager, said in an interview, explaining the abrupt announcement. “He had a strong appreciation of what voters expected of him and what he wanted to accomplish for them, and to get all that done just wasn’t consistent with where he views his next 5, 10 years of his life.”        
“There’s no scandal, no family issue, no health problem,” he said. Mr. Daley, a lawyer and businessman who is the brother of former Mayor Richard M. Daley and the son of former Mayor Richard J. Daley, was expected to answer questions at a news conference on Tuesday morning.        
In a videotaped interview with T Tribune, Mr. Daley said that his years around politics, including service in President Obama’s White House in 2011, had turned out not to be the same as actually running for office. “Even though you’re around it for a long time, you really don’t get a sense of the enormity of it until you get into it,” he said in the interview.        
Mr. Quinn, a former lieutenant governor who became governor after Rod R. Blagojevich was arrested in 2008 on federal corruption charges, has wrestled with the state’s underfunded pension system, which has been deemed the worst in the nation.        
For a time, it appeared that he would face serious opposition from fellow Democrats in a state where that party controls both chambers in Springfield. Lisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general and daughter of the powerful state House speaker, considered running against Mr. Quinn, but ultimately did not. Mr. Daley, the secretary of commerce under President Bill Clinton who had previously expressed interest in political offices but had never pursued them, this summer announced his intention to run.        
Now Republicans appear likely to present Mr. Quinn with his most serious challenges in 2014, experts said.

DALGA, Egypt — A convoy of more than a dozen armored police and army vehicles arrived here just before dawn on Monday, rolling into the rural village that has witnessed the most horrific sectarian violence in Egypt since the military’s ouster two months ago of President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Among the damage, a 1,650-year-old monastery, its two churches and as many as 35 homes belonging to Christians have all been burned or ransacked.        


But the security forces did not bring such heavy weapons to protect Christian residents. Interior ministry officials said the expedition was an attempt to capture a single fugitive Islamist, and it may depart soon. The overwhelming force, they said, was merely for self-protection: the surrounding province of Minya is still considered a bastion of Islamist support for Mr. Morsi.        
The scale of the operation — including helicopters and scores of heavily armed troops, in a town with a population of 120,000 — was the latest indication of the challenge the government appointed two months ago by Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi appears to face as it struggles to control the Islamist strongholds in rural southern regions of Egypt.        
In Cairo, where Islamists were always weakest, the security forces have ridden a wave of public approbation as they have moved quickly to impose a tight lockdown on street protests. Demonstrators opposing the new government are ever wary, fenced in by security forces, harried by hostile residents and fearful of attack. But in Minya, the provincial capital, the situation is so starkly inverted that a visitor might almost think that Mr. Morsi was still president of Egypt.        
Hundreds or even thousands of his supporters march through the streets for hours almost every night. Families parade infants on their shoulders, brigades of women march together and neighbors smile and wave from windows. Any who disapprove hold their tongues, aware they are outnumbered.        
The security forces seldom venture beyond a tight ring of barbed wire and armored vehicles protecting the provincial headquarters. During a recent weekday evening protest, a lone police car waited patiently at an intersection for a parade of Morsi supporters several blocks long to make its way past. “Keep hoping, President, Sisi is a good donkey,” they chanted — a play on the general’s last name, which is the Arabic word for “pony.”        
“This coup is not going to last for long, because it is committing suicide — it is clinically dying,” Galal Fahim, an Islamist, insisted confidently, smiling as he marched with thousands of others here in Dalga on Friday. The province, a center of the armed Islamist insurgency that flared up in the 1990s, voted two to one in favor of Mr. Morsi in the 2012 presidential election. And dozens of people were killed here last month in clashes with security forces on the day they also stormed two Islamist sit-ins in Cairo, killing nearly a thousand, according to a recent estimate by the interim prime minister.        
But since then, Islamist leaders say, their demonstrations and marches have avoided the provincial government headquarters, and the security forces in turn have largely stayed put there.        
Local leaders of the Brotherhood, Egypt’s largest Islamist group, are all under arrest or in hiding. Provincial leadership of the Islamist opposition has passed to Gamaa al-Islamiya, a more conservative group that led the armed insurgency here in the mid-1990s but has since renounced violence. Members of the group organize and guide marches, passing out props like signs that depict protesters from Minya who were killed by the security forces.        
Despite the crackdown the group’s leaders appear to operate freely out of their downtown office. “The people sitting in front of you have spent more than 20 years in jail, so what can happen to them now?” Rajab Hassan, 47, the group’s leader in southern Egypt, asked, gesturing with a smile to four colleagues on a couch.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Glenn Fleisig’s rather unusual laboratory has a pitcher’s mound and a home plate, and when he rigs people up to throw a baseball, their motion is analyzed with sensors feeding into computers.        


Nearby is a second lab, and that is where Fleisig, the research director at the American Sports Medicine Institute, keeps the body parts, dead shoulders, elbows and knees. These appendages, severed from cadavers, can be stretched until the ligaments and tendons are stressed enough to snap.        
Fleisig, a biomedical engineer, knows what an arm can handle, and years of research give him the confidence to answer one of baseball’s more intriguing questions: Is there a limit to how fast a human being can throw?        
His answer: Yes, there is.        
And, he adds: That limit already has been reached.        
“Oh, there may be an outlier, one exception here or there,” he said. “But for major league baseball pitchers as a group of elites, the top isn’t going to go up anymore. With better conditioning and nutrition and mechanics, more pitchers will be toward that top, throwing at 95 or 100. But the top has topped out.”        
So 110 will not become the new 100. Fleisig attributes this conclusion to the frailty of ligaments and tendons, already stretched to the limit by the pitching motion, the final whip of which he calls the fastest-known human movement.        
“When you ask about performance and velocity, I end up talking about medicine and injury,” he said. “You can’t strengthen tendons and ligaments per se, certainly not as much as muscles. The muscles overwhelm them.”        
And then comes that snap.        
“Velocity itself is a risk factor for injury,” he said.        
Mets pitcher Matt Harvey is the latest unfortunate example to confirm Fleisig’s research. Harvey, a 24-year-old who is among the hardest-throwing starters in baseball, learned Aug. 26 that he has a partial ligament tear in his right elbow. On Monday, Harvey met with Dr. James Andrews, the orthopedic surgeon who is the medical director of the institute. Whether Harvey opts to have surgery that would sideline him for a year — a decision most likely to be made in coming days — will depend to a considerable degree on what Andrews recommends.        
And whatever decision is made, it seems clear that Harvey has already come up against his body’s own speed limits.        
Those inherent human limits may be bad news for those who believe records are made to be broken, that the fastest inevitably cedes to the faster. On the other hand, no one really knows the record for the fastest pitch ever thrown.        
Baseball might have a grand history supported by well-kept statistics, but pitching velocity has not been a mark easy to assess — perhaps until now.        
In 2007, Major League Baseball began widespread use of the Pitch F/X system from the company Sportvision in conjunction with MLB Advanced Media; by 2008, the system had been installed in all 30 major league ballparks. Tracking software now follows the trajectory of each pitch, calculating its position and velocity along the way.        
The speed readings were not entirely reliable until 2008, according to Graham Goldbeck, Sportvision’s manager of data analytics and operations. But since then, he said, it is a very accurate speedometer.        
The fastest pitch recorded by the system is 105.1 miles per hour. It was thrown by Cincinnati Reds reliever Aroldis Chapman on Sept. 24, 2010, during an at-bat by Tony Gwynn Jr. of the San Diego Padres. The pitch was called a ball, leveling the count at 2-2. “I didn’t see it until the ball was behind me,” Gwynn said.        
In fact, Chapman has thrown 17 of the 20 fastest pitches recorded by Pitch F/X since 2008, according to Goldbeck. Four of those heaters came during Gwynn’s seven-pitch at-bat, which ended in a strikeout. Two others were thrown by Chapman that same night against other Padres.        
Of course, the question of “Who’s the fastest pitcher ever?” will draw different responses from Great Grandpa, Grandpa, Dad and Junior. Likely names surfacing in the conversation would include Walter Johnson, Bob Feller, Satchel Paige, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Billy Wagner and, for real aficionados, Steve Dalkowski.

The Philippine military on Tuesday rescued almost 80 of the 100 hostages being held by Muslim rebels, a major breakthrough in a battle that has paralyzed an important southern city for more than a week.        


Three soldiers were killed in the operation, in which 64 hostages were initially set free, with 14 others then managing to walk to freedom.        
“Our soldiers used selective fire to neutralize the kidnappers,” Lt. Col. Harold Cabunoc, a military spokesman, said in a statement.        
The standoff began when the insurgents, from the Moro National Liberation Front, entered the port city of Zamboanga by sea on Sept. 8, tried to take control of City Hall and, the police said, declared an independent Islamic state. When the police tried to repel them, the insurgents took scores of hostages and retreated to other parts of the city.        
Because of the insurgent threat, more than 70,000 residents of the city have been displaced, and at least 50 people have been killed in the clashes, with hundreds of homes destroyed. Government officials said they had now recaptured 70 percent of the coastal areas of Zamboanga.

MOSCOW — Secretary of State John Kerry had just made an offhand remark about how President Bashar al-Assad of Syria could avoid a military strike — and now Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s hard-charging foreign minister, was on the phone.        


Mr. Lavrov was not about to let the moment pass.        
What aides to Mr. Kerry were already trying to roll back, Mr. Lavrov seized on, telling Mr. Kerry he would immediately go public with a Russian-led proposal to dismantle the Syrian chemical weapons arsenal. That prompted a sharp response from Mr. Kerry who warned in the 14-minute call, “We are not going to play games.”        
By the time Mr. Kerry’s plane landed back in Washington, the ground had shifted and on Saturday, not a week later, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov completed the plan sitting by the pool at a Geneva hotel.        
It is a pact that American arms control experts have scrambled to shape and that the White House believes may be the best way to the uphold prohibitions against the use of poison gas without resorting to military force. But it is also one that the Kremlin clearly thinks serves the interests of Russia and the Syrian government.        
In many ways, Mr. Lavrov’s work over the next six days represented the apex of a career largely spent trying to body-block what the Kremlin has long viewed as dangerous American unilateralism. It is a job he has done so effectively that it has earned him the nickname “Minister Nyet,” and senior American officials, including Hillary Rodham Clinton and Condoleezza Rice, have said they often found it infuriating to deal with him.        
As the diplomatic technician for his boss, President Vladimir V. Putin, Mr. Lavrov maneuvered to hem in the United States, averting a unilateral military strike and reasserting Russia’s role — all while Russia was continuing to provide weapons to Mr. Assad and diplomatic cover for his effort to suppress an uprising.        
More broadly, though, Mr. Lavrov has sought to force the United States into a conversation that the Kremlin hopes will set a precedent, establishing Russia’s role in world affairs based not on the dated cold war paradigm but rather on its own outlook, which favors state sovereignty and status quo stability over the spread of Western-style democracy.        
In doing so, Mr. Lavrov relied on his long experience, not just on nearly 10 years as foreign minister. He served more than a decade as Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, where he developed an intricate knowledge of the workings of the Security Council, as well as deep experience in international disarmament efforts, including in Iraq.        
“For now, he’s one of the most skilled diplomats in the world,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, editor in chief of the policy journal Russia in Global Affairs. “The time of real diplomacy has come back.”        
For Mr. Lavrov it is a series of events he has long prepared for. He graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations in 1972 and moved to New York in 1981 to work at the United Nations after brief stints in Sri Lanka, and in Moscow.        
At the United Nations, he was known for his elaborate, seemingly absent-minded doodling during lengthy meetings but also for a command of the issues.        
“He was a great doodler, but his mind was always spinning away,” said Charles A. Duelfer, who was deputy head of the United Nations’ weapons inspectors program in Iraq in the 1990s and frequently met with Mr. Lavrov at the United Nations headquarters in New York.        
Mr. Duelfer said that Mr. Lavrov’s long experience with United Nations inspectors working to remove unconventional arms from Iraq helped him to quickly assess the situation in Syria and to work out a detailed plan with Mr. Kerry. “He knows this stuff because he lived through it in Iraq,” Mr. Duelfer said. “He’s knows what’s possible when you have independent inspectors.”        
A more cynical view, analysts and Western diplomats said, is that Mr. Lavrov was after a political objective, not one of disarmament, using diplomatic jujitsu to buy time for the Assad regime.

Rick Casares, a fullback for the Chicago Bears in the 1950s and ’60s who bulled through defensive lines to become, for a time, the leading rusher in team history, and who once led the National Football League in rushing, died on Friday at his home in Tampa, Fla. He was 82.        


His wife, Polly, confirmed his death.        
Two decades before Walter Payton rewrote rushing records in Chicago and across the N.F.L. with dazzling, acrobatic performances, Casares, a former star at the University of Florida, pounded the way forward for the Bears, often scratching out 3 and 4 yards at a time. He frequently played injured and later in life had two knee replacements, shoulder surgery and other operations.        
“He was the toughest guy I ever played with,” Mike Ditka, a former Bears tight end and coach, told The Tampa Tribune. “I remember him playing on a broken ankle.”        
In 10 seasons with the Bears, from 1955 to 1964, Casares — who stood 6 feet 3 inches and weighed about 230 pounds — became the team’s career rushing leader, with 5,657 yards. (Payton, in 13 seasons, from 1975 to 1987, ran for 16,726.) In 1956, Casares led the league with 1,126 yards, at the time the second-highest season total in N.F.L. history. He also led the league that year in rushing touchdowns and total touchdowns scored.        
He played in five consecutive Pro Bowls, from 1955 to 1959, and remains third on the Bears’ career rushing list. Neal Anderson is second, with 6,166 yards in eight seasons, from 1986 to 1993.        
Despite his injuries, Casares wanted more carries than he was given in his later years with the Bears, and he once publicly questioned the team’s coach, George Halas, after Halas changed the Bears’ offense in 1961. Casares’s carries were reduced sharply the next year, and he was never again central to the offense.        
He was on the team when it won the 1963 N.F.L. championship, but he had an injured ankle and did not play.        
Casares was traded to the Washington Redskins in 1965 and played sparingly. He played for the Miami Dolphins in 1966, the team’s first year in existence, carrying the ball 43 times in six games.        
“The best years of my life were in Chicago,” Casares told The Chicago Tribune in 2010.        
The Bears held a commemoration for the 1963 team at Soldier Field during their game on Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings.        
Richard Jose Casares was born on July 4, 1931, in Tampa. A grandfather was Spanish, while the rest of his family traced its lineage to Italy. When Casares was 7, his father was murdered, prompting his mother to move with him to her native New Jersey. Casares became a promising boxer as a teenager, but his mother refused to allow him to pursue the sport professionally.        
He returned to Tampa, where he became a statewide high school star in football, baseball, basketball, and track and field. He also played several sports in college, and he led the Gators to victory in the Gator Bowl after the 1952 season.        
After missing his senior season to serve in the Army, he was drafted in the second round by the Bears in 1954.        
After his playing days, Casares opened a nightclub in Tampa, the Huddle Lounge. He also worked in real estate.        
Casares and his wife, the former Polly Wilkins, were married in 1969. In addition to her, survivors include a stepdaughter, Dawn Cleary, and a grandson.

GIGLIO, Italy — Salvage workers righted the scarred and discolored hull of the cruise ship Costa Concordia early Tuesday after coaxing it from two granite reefs it ran aground on just off this tiny tourist island 20 months ago, killing 32 people.        


As the vast hull slowly emerged during the complex, 19-hour salvage operation, the full extent of damage to the vessel became apparent. It looked as if a giant fist had driven into the ship’s flank.        
Ships’ horns blared over Giglio’s tiny port to celebrate the moment, and some of the island’s 1,500 residents hugged salvage workers as they came ashore from what is likely to be seen as a bold step toward redressing some of Italy’s anguish after the Costa Concordia, the length of three football fields, careened into the reefs on a wintry night in January 2012.        
“This was an important, visible step,” Franco Gabrielli, head of Italy’s Civil Protection Agency, told reporters at 4 a.m., accompanied by applause from a few residents who had stayed up all night to follow the operation.        
He was echoed by Franco Porcellacchia, project manager for Costa Cruises, the ship’s operator. “There is no evidence so far of any impact to the environment,” he said. “If there are debris to be removed, we will do it tomorrow.”        
On Tuesday morning, at a crowded news conference on Giglio port, Italian officials seemed almost surprised by how precisely their calculations had worked, but expressed caution about future steps to secure the vessel before it can be towed away and scrapped, probably in the spring. “The phases to come will be just as complicated,” Mr. Porcellacchia said.        
Nick Sloane, the salvage master, said the operation exceeded his expectations. “It was nice to see that at 4 a.m.,” he told reporters Tuesday afternoon.        
Mr. Sloane explained that a full survey of the damage, which he called substantial, would be possible only after Italian authorities carried out their inspections and searched for the bodies of two people aboard the ship who are still missing.        
The operation left the 951-foot ship resting on an artificial platform 90 feet below the surface, with only about a third of its once-sleek white lines visible above water. Engineers said the badly damaged starboard side would need to be welded and reinforced, so that other steel chambers, known as caissons and crucial to the operation to right the ship, can be attached. The vessel will also need to be further secured to withstand winter weather, engineers said.        
“We will consider the operation concluded once the ship leaves Giglio Island,” Mr. Gabrielli told reporters, acknowledging that risks remained while the wreck was at sea. “We’ll carry out all the needed interventions to mitigate it and allow the ship to face the next winter in secure conditions,” he said.        
Mr. Sloane said he could hear workers jumping around with relief and delight as the ship was gently laid on the platform. “It was like a roller coaster,” he said.        
The righting of the vessel did not draw universal applause.        
“I don’t necessarily think that this is a great victory for Italy, maybe for the Italian and American companies involved,” said Suzanne Kmetyko, 50, a tourist from Austria who has visited the island for the past seven years.        
“And the real success for the island will come only once people around the world will stop remembering it for the shipwreck rather than for its natural beauty,” she said. “A long way to go.”        
Italian news media, by contrast, portrayed the salvage, broadcast live on television and the Internet, as a chance for the country to revamp its image after the wreck, in which the captain fled the damaged ship and the evacuation was chaotic. The leading national daily, Corriere della Sera, called the shipwreck “a monument to human stupidity” and a “humiliation” for Italy. It said it hoped that the salvage effort would provide a “new and different story” for the country.        
It was not always clear what that story would be.        
As parts of the Concordia emerged in the late afternoon on Monday, stained and rusting, from the waters where the vessel had languished, engineers had said the operation would most likely take longer than initially planned.        
The sheer size of the Concordia had created what salvage specialists called unparalleled challenges not only to right the ship but also to protect Giglio Island, a marine sanctuary, from environmental hazard.        
Salvage workers used huge jacks, cables, pulleys and specialized equipment, first to ease the vessel off its rocky perch and then to right it. The first few hours “were the most uncertain, as we could not establish how much the hull was wedged,” Sergio Girotto, project manager with Micoperi, the project’s underwater construction and offshore contractor, said on Monday.        
The ship’s captain, Francesco Schettino, is scheduled to go on trial this fall on charges of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the vessel before everyone was safe. He has denied wrongdoing. A company official and four crew members have already pleaded guilty to reduced charges.        
Salvage masters and the Italian authorities had prepared for complications. Most of the fuel was siphoned off within months of the wreck. But the vessel that once transported and entertained 4,229 people still contains chemicals and diesel fuel that could leak into the pristine Mediterranean waters for which Giglio, a popular tourist spot, is known.

KABUL, Afghanistan — The top United Nations human rights official emerged from a meeting here with President Hamid Karzai on Tuesday without hoped-for assurances that he would reverse his decision to pack the country’s human rights commission with political appointees.        


The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, was also generally critical about progress on human rights in the country, saying it was endangered in part because officials were more focused on political concerns ahead of presidential elections next April.        
“There have been some human rights achievements during the past 12 years, but they are fragile,” Ms. Pillay said during a news conference on Tuesday at the end of a two-day visit here. “And many Afghans are expressing fears that the overall human rights situation is deteriorating on several fronts.”        
Human rights activists have been particularly alarmed by Mr. Karzai’s five new appointees to the nine-member Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. None of the five were on a list proposed by civic and human rights groups, and they included a former Taliban official; a polarizing politician from the country’s leading fundamentalist party, Jamiat-i-Islami; and a police general.        
Ms. Pillay had already warned publicly that the appointments might lead to the commission being downgraded in its status internationally, which could in turn lead to its international financing being cut off.        
“This would be a very serious and regrettable setback for one of the current Afghan government’s most notable achievements in the area of human rights,” she said.        
Ms. Pillay said that in her meeting with Mr. Karzai, she again asked him to rescind those appointments.        
“I made convincing arguments for him,” she said. “I left in the hope that he will revisit the matter. He did not specifically say that he would.”        
The Afghan human rights commission has often angered members of the country’s political elite, particularly the many former warlords with dubious human rights records who hold powerful positions in Afghanistan’s governing institutions.        
Ms. Pillay also praised Mr. Karzai for what she called “his strong public stand against the use of torture in numerous Afghan detention facilities.” But she also noted that such torture continues to be common, and that “there has not been a single successful prosecution of a state employee for torture.”

In January 2012, the Chicago Bears were looking for a new general manager. That search ended with the hiring of Phil Emery, a relative unknown who was the Kansas City Chiefs’ director of college scouting. Emery did not make any immediate splashes, but one year later, he made two bold decisions that could have easily turned the Chicago faithful against him.        


The Bears went 10-6 in 2012, but Emery chose to fire Coach Lovie Smith. The move was not without controversy; Marty Schottenheimer and Steve Mariucci had been the only coaches in the last 20 years to be fired after winning 10 games.        
Bears players liked Smith, and replacing him was going to be challenging no matter whom Emery hired. But Emery went a step further: he didn’t hire an aspiring young offensive coordinator or the next great college coach. Instead, he went to the Canadian Football League to find Marc Trestman, the coach of the Montreal Alouettes. 
The next decision might have been even more courageous. Emery and Trestman got into a public contract dispute with Brian Urlacher, the on-field face of the Bears for the last decade. Chicago could have re-signed Urlacher, whose contract was expiring, but new management offered (in Urlacher’s words) a lowball contract to retain him.        
As it turned out, Emery and Trestman read the market correctly: Urlacher retired after finding that no team was willing to spend big money on an aging linebacker. The new leaders risked alienating fans and losing the good will that new hires typically receive.        
But few fans seem to be spending much time these days thinking about whether Emery should have retained Smith or Urlacher. That’s because the Bears, one of the more exciting teams in the N.F.L., are 2-0.        
The decisions by Emery and Trestman to fix the offense, which was always Smith’s blind spot, have been paying off. For years, the offensive line had been the team’s weakest unit, and Emery made that a key focus of his off-season. Chicago’s first-round pick in this year’s draft was Oregon’s Kyle Long, who is now entrenched at right guard.        
At left guard, the Bears signed Matt Slauson, who had been a cog in one of the league’s best offensive lines for years with the Jets. Chicago addressed the left tackle spot by landing Jermon Bushrod, who had been protecting Drew Brees’s blind side for four years in New Orleans. At right tackle, the fifth-round pick Jordan Mills won the job, giving Chicago four new starters on the line. Center Roberto Garza is the only holdover of a line that is no longer holding the team back.        
In 2011 and 2012, Bears quarterbacks were sacked a combined 93 times, second most in the league. But Jay Cutler has been sacked only once this season, particularly impressive given that the two teams the Bears beat, Minnesota and Cincinnati, had defenses that finished in the top seven in sacks and in sack rate in 2012.        
The run blocking appears improved, too. According to Nathan Jahnke of Pro Football Focus, Chicago’s average rushing gain before contact in 2012 was just 2.0 yards. Despite facing two strong front sevens, the Bears have averaged 2.3 yards before contact this year.        
Trestman’s system seems to be doing wonders for Cutler, too. Pro Football Focus tracks how long it takes after the snap for a quarterback to throw a pass, be sacked or scramble. According to Jahnke, Cutler averaged 2.81 seconds in 2011 and 2.79 in 2012. Through two weeks in 2013, Cutler has been making quicker decisions (or finding his receivers open more quickly), and that average has dropped to 2.57.        
It is not just Trestman’s system and the line that are making life easier for Cutler. The team finally gave him a playmaking tight end. In 2011, Chicago tight ends caught just 25 passes for 256 yards; in 2012, they caught 33 passes for just 318 yards. In both years, the Bears ranked last in both categories.        
One of Emery’s biggest off-season moves was the acquisition of the talented but enigmatic Martellus Bennett. He has 10 catches for 125 yards and 3 touchdowns in the team’s first two games, including the winner on Sunday against the Vikings. That has helped open things up for the team’s All-Pro wide receiver, Brandon Marshall, who, with 15 catches, 217 yards and 2 touchdowns, continues to play at an elite level.        
How the Bears’ season will unfold is still in question, of course, but it does look as if hiring Emery last year and Trestman this year will give the team a strong foundation. Cutler has completed 68.1 percent of his passes the first two weeks and has a 95.4 passer rating; both would easily be career highs if he were to maintain that pace. This year might turn into a special season for Cutler in more ways than one: he is also just 1,863 passing yards from overtaking Sid Luckman and becoming the franchise’s career leader.        
Cutler’s Comebacks 
Jay Cutler led a fourth-quarter comeback for the second week in a row, the sixth time since 2002 that a quarterback has done that in both of his team’s first two games. It’s the second time for Cutler, who first pulled off the feat with Denver in 2007. The others: Matt Schaub (2013, Houston), Michael Vick (2012, Philadelphia), Jake Delhomme (2008, Carolina) and Alex Smith (2007, San Francisco).        
Slow Going With Rushing 
Nearly every team had an unsuccessful running game in Week 1: There were 824 rush attempts for 2,984 yards and 18 touchdowns, which comes out to an ugly 3.62 yards a carry across the N.F.L. Things were only slightly better in Week 2, with a 3.99 average on 833 carries for 3,322 yards and 18 touchdowns. Some of the main culprits were Pittsburgh, the Giants, Jacksonville, Cleveland and Miami. For the season, all five teams have rushed for less than 125 yards and have averaged less than 3.5 yards a carry.        
Touchdown Bonanza 
Eddie Royal caught just 10 touchdown passes in his first five seasons, and had only one touchdown with San Diego last season. But Royal already has five touchdown receptions in the Chargers’ first two games this season, tying an N.F.L. record. Five other players caught five touchdown passes in their teams’ first two games: Marvin Harrison (1999, Colts), Daryl Turner (1985, Seahawks), Ben Hawkins (1969, Eagles), Elroy Hirsch (1951, Rams) and Bobby Shaw (1950, Cardinals). Peyton Manning has nine touchdown passes, tying the record held by Charley Johnson (1965, Cardinals) and Drew Brees (2009, Saints).

I like to think of my Roomba as cute and industrious. He makes noises while he cleans that make me feel as if he’s communicating with me, which contributes to the fact that I have assigned him a sex. He exists in a liminal space between animate and inanimate, but once he’s done cleaning my floors, I don’t mind putting him in the closet until I need his services again — he’s a rolling disc, after all.        


Robosimian — a headless, quadrupedal disaster-response robot designed by engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory — is a bit more useful than my Roomba, slightly more human-looking and a lot less cute: the C-3PO to my R2-D2. Robosimian can maneuver over rubble and through narrow corridors in order to, one day, rescue humans from peril. But its more difficult task will be forming some sort of bond with the E.M.T.’s and first responders who might use it. Robosimian will be more than just a tool, but not quite a colleague.        
In the future, more robots will occupy that strange gray zone: doing not only jobs that humans can do but also jobs that require social grace. In the last decade, an interdisciplinary field of research called Human-Robot Interaction has arisen to study the factors that make robots work well with humans, and how humans view their robotic counterparts.        
H.R.I. researchers have discovered some rather surprising things: a robot’s behavior can have a bigger impact on its relationship with humans than its design; many of the rules that govern human relationships apply equally well to human-robot relations; and people will read emotions and motivations into a robot’s behavior that far exceed the robot’s capabilities. As we employ those lessons to build robots that can be better caretakers, maids and emergency responders, we risk further blurring the (once unnecessary) line between tools and beings.        
Provided with the right behavioral cues, humans will form relationships with just about anything — regardless of what it looks like. Even a stick can trigger our social promiscuity. In 2011, Ehud Sharlin, a computer scientist at the University of Calgary, ran an observational experiment to test this impulse to connect. His subjects sat alone in a room with a very simple “robot”: a long, balsa-wood rectangle attached to some gears, controlled by a joystick-wielding human who, hidden from view, ran it through a series of predetermined movements. Sharlin wanted to find out how much agency humans would attribute to a stick.        
Some subjects tried to fight the stick, or talk it out of wanting to fight them. One woman panicked, complaining that the stick wouldn’t stop pointing at her. Some tried to dance with it. The study found that a vast majority assumed the stick had its own goals and internal thought proc­esses. They described the stick as bowing in greeting, searching for hidden items, even purring like a contented cat.        
When a robot moves on its own, it exploits a fundamental social instinct that all humans have: the ability to separate things into objects (like rocks and trees) and agents (like a bug or another person). Its evolutionary importance seems self-evident; typically, kids can do this by the time they’re a year old.        
The distinction runs deeper than knowing something is capable of movement. “Nobody questions the motivations of a rock rolling down a hill,” says Brian Scassellati, director of Yale’s social robotics lab. Agents, on the other hand, have internal states that we speculate about. The ability to distinguish between agents and objects is the basis for another important human skill that scientists call “cognitive empathy” (or “theory of mind,” depending on whom you ask): the ability to predict what other beings are thinking, and what they want, by watching how they move.        
“We make these assumptions very quickly and naturally,” Scassellati says. “And it’s not new, or even limited to the world of robotics. Look at animation. They know the rules, too. A sack of flour can look sad or angry. It’s all about how it moves.”

TEHRAN — Iranians lost unrestricted access to Facebook and Twitter on Tuesday almost before they knew they had it, leaving many people wondering whether the opening was deliberate or the result of some technical glitch.        


The Web sites had been blocked since huge antigovernment protests exploded after the disputed presidential election in 2009. But for almost a full day on Monday, jubilant Iranians were able to call them up without resorting to VPN software, which is illegal.        
The Internet has long been a battleground in Iran between those pushing for more personal freedoms and hard-liners who feel they must protect society from dangerous influences — a struggle that may have played out on Monday.        
Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, has repeatedly promised an easing of Internet restrictions. He has a Twitter account, which is managed by people close to him. His foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has Facebook and Twitter accounts where he actively engages in debates.        
Political insiders say Monday’s mysterious unblocking of Facebook and Twitter was an attempt by certain groups within the Iranian political establishment — it was not clear exactly who — to measure the reactions of Internet users.        
“Monday’s move was a test conducted to see what people would do if Facebook and Twitter were opened,” said one source close to the new government who asked to remain anonymous because of the secrecy surrounding the matter. “Apparently the test results have been unfavorable, because the sites have been closed again.”        
That was echoed by Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst close to the government. “It seems to me the authorities wanted to see what would happen if the Web sites were opened,” he said. “This is not uncommon in Iran.”        
It was unclear exactly what the authorities would have been seeking to find out with such a test.        
Conservatives tended to favor a technical glitch as the explanation for the unblocking of the Web sites. “God willing this has been a mistake,” Judge Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, a prominent hard-liner, told the semiofficial Mehr news agency. “But if this was done on purpose, we will confront those behind it.”        
Judge Khoramabadi warned on Sunday that Facebook is destroying families, saying that it is the cause of one-fifth of all divorces in the United States. “Some officials seem to be unaware of the dangers of this Web site when they speak of unblocking it,” he told the Khabaronline Web news site.        
On Tuesday, the semiofficial Fars news agency published a long article pointing out the dangers of social media, saying that Facebook was blurring the lines between private and public.        
“Many women choose profile pictures without their Islamic scarves,” Fars wrote in an editorial. “Facebook is aiming to blur our cultural lines between private and public. There are no borders on Facebook. This is extremely dangerous.”        
But in another sign that Monday’s unblocking was a test, a well-known TV anchor, Reza Rashidpour, who campaigned for Mr. Rouhani, congratulated Iranians on Monday for gaining unrestricted social media access but also cautioned them. “We hope our people will restrain themselves and our officials will be patient,” he said.        
If indeed a test was conducted, it seemed to reveal a pent-up hunger for less restriction and more interaction. One Twitter message by this reporter — “Hello world, we are tweeting without restrictions from Iran” — was retweeted nearly 900 times, with many Twitter users welcoming Iran to Twitter and Iranians saying they could not believe what was happening.        
But the window quickly closed. Rayaneh, a poet, said she tried to get online on Monday to post a message to the world. “1, 2, 3 ... 1, 2, 3 ... Can you hear us? We are testing if Facebook is running without VPN here,” she said. “But by that time, the filters were back on.”

PARIS — European auto sales declined again in August, an industry group reported on Tuesday, erasing a rare gain in July.         
New passenger-car registrations fell 5 percent in August from a year earlier, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association reported from Brussels, after a 5 percent increase in July. The July gain was only the second year-over-year rise in 2013, after a 1.7 percent rise in April.        
The association released data for both July and August simultaneously after its summer recess. Figures for the two months were distorted by calendar differences: August 2013 had one fewer working day than a year earlier, while July had one more.        
For the first eight months of the year, sales were just 7,841,596 units, the lowest reading for that period since the association began tracking the data in 1990.        
Harald Hendrikse, an analyst at Nomura International in London, said that taken together, the two months appeared to have been roughly flat from a year earlier.        
“The good news is that there is probably no more deterioration,” he said. “Clearly, from a low, low base, we are stabilizing. The bad news is that it’s not getting any better, either.”        
The European auto market has been in retreat since the financial crisis, the downward progress halted at times only by the temporary stimulus of government cash-for-clunker programs, in which owners receive tax rebates in exchange for trading in older cars.        
Unemployment is high in Europe — 12.1 percent in the 17-country euro zone generally, and more than 25 percent in Spain and Greece. And cars are seen as a luxury, rather than a necessity, by those consumers who have access to good public transportation.        
“With no new jobs, with a declining population and with an aging population, demand for new cars naturally declines,” Mr. Hendrikse said, noting that a similar phenomenon was occurring in Japan, where car demand has been shrinking for most of the last 25 years. In the United States, by contrast, car sales have been steadily exceeding last year’s pace.        
Mr. Hendrikse predicted that European sales would decline about 5 percent this year and remain essentially flat in 2014. For 2015, he predicted a modest 2 percent increase.        
One quirk of the European slump has been that, among major markets, only British sales have held up this year. The British market grew by 10.9 percent in August from a year earlier. The German market, the largest in Europe, shrank by 5.5 percent, while France declined by 10.5 percent and Spain by 18.3 percent. Italian sales fell by 6.6 percent.        
Mr. Hendrikse said Britain’s resilience stemmed partly from the fact that the country was further along in the economic cycle than Europe and partly because British consumers were more willing to use credit for car purchases than their continental counterparts.        
Louise Wallis, a spokeswoman for the Retail Motor Industry Federation, a British trade group, said that at least half of all vehicles financed in Britain were now sold using deals known as “personal contract purchasing.”        
Under such financing, similar to leasing in the United States, the consumer pays relatively low monthly payments for three years, and then has the option of either paying a large “balloon payment” and taking ownership, or simply returning the car to the manufacturer and starting over.        
Most people opt to turn over the keys and get a new car, Ms. Wallis said.        
Among European car companies, Volkswagen, the largest, posted an 11.2 percent decline in August sales, led lower by the 17.3 percent drop in its flagship brand.        
Sales at the French automaker P.S.A. Peugeot Citroën, the Continent’s No. 2 automaker, fell 17.3 percent in August. Renault posted a 6 percent increase on the strength of its low-cost Dacia brand.        
Daimler sales rose 5.8 percent on demand for its Mercedes-Benz cars, as sales of its Smart cars slid nearly 24 percent. BMW’s sales rose 9.8 percent.        
Toyota’s European sales fell 5.4 percent in August, General Motors’ rose 0.5 percent, and Ford sales fell 1.5 percent.

Dining,"










It’s not worth trying to persuade anyone to become vegan, for a couple of very good reasons: one, it’s a losing battle, and two, it’s far from certain that a diet with no animal products is best for everyone. It’s increasingly evident, however, that a part-time vegan diet — one that emphasizes minimally processed plant food at the expense of everything else — is the direction that will do the most to benefit human health, increase animal welfare and reduce environmental impact. The remaining challenge, an undeniably big one, is to figure out how to make such a diet, which you might also call “flexitarian,” the standard.        


My own diet, which I call Vegan Before 6 (and wrote a book about), is one way of tackling part-time veganism, but it isn’t the only way. An intelligent adaptation of the Mediterranean diet, one of the popular “fast today, feast tomorrow” diets or even a so-called paleo diet — one that stresses vegetables rather than animal products (our great ancestors, after all, were gatherer-hunters who saw meat not as routine but as an occasion to feast) — can put you on the right track.        
As can this: a day of your choosing when you just go vegan.        
There are, of course, true vegans who will say that part-time veganism is a little-bit-pregnant kind of thing; that is, impossible. But since the word means a diet without animal products, it can be used to describe something as part-time as a meal: a salad is, after all, a vegan meal. (I am aware, having had this argument dozens of times in the last few years, that many full-time vegans’ primary concern is animal welfare, and that’s a different discussion.)        
Being a vegan is not my point, and anyway, it’s as easy to create an unhealthy full-time vegan diet as it is to eat brilliantly as a part-time vegan. It just takes a little thought and a little will, though perhaps less will than you might think at first. Many cooked dishes that contain animal products can be and traditionally have been made without them, usually out of want. The problem for most people in developed countries is not a lack of opportunity to eat animal products but a superabundance.        
It isn’t as if vegetables are in short supply. Yes, local or organic produce is expensive (and so inconveniently seasonal!), but if you are going to eat it, now is your chance. It isn’t a coincidence that this column is appearing in September; to me, the period between Labor Day and Thanksgiving is the best time of year to cook — warm enough to grill and cool enough to braise, with the farmers’ market still an absolute paradigm of abundance. Take advantage: in a few months, there may be little more than root vegetables, apple cider and hand-dyed yarn.        
When fruits and vegetables are at their best, they give you insight into how the vegan thing can work for you, if only for a day. And given a moderate degree of freshness, most conventional vegetables from ordinary supermarkets can be made to taste good when gardens go dormant.        
Plant-based meals contain more than vegetables, of course: Stock the pantry with good grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, oils, vinegars and other classic condiments, and you’re set to make an infinite number of dishes that don’t ruffle a single animal’s feathers, hide or fin.        
Here then are some recipes for what you might call A Vegan Day. I don’t pretend that you’re likely to eat all five in the same day, or even that they have much relationship to one another, but they’re each a representation of the kind of thing you might be eating at a given moment. Some are simple, traditional peasant food: hoecakes made from little but corn and water may seem ascetic until you recognize that this is polenta in a fast, crunchy form, filled with flavor and perfect to bury under a pile of fruit. (You can jazz them up if you like: a little sugar, a little baking powder, a little nondairy milk, maybe some maple syrup, and they start to resemble something far richer and more common. I happen to like the ultraminimalist version.)        
Some are elaborate, and designed to satisfy an open-minded if devoted meat-eater at the biggest meal of the day. This ratatouille with chickpeas and fennel is among the best I’ve ever made, and bow ties with bulgur and what amounts to a salad is as good at room temperature as any pasta I know. The others are creatively simple: carrot candy is as much fun to eat as it is to look at; broiled melon is a lovely and unusual dessert.        
The options are infinite: I love jook for breakfast, as well as more conventional porridge (or mush) or something more modern, like quinoa cooked in almond milk. Chopped salad may have become a cliché, but there may not be a better vegan lunch (you might try one with a Thai- or Japanese-flavored dressing for variety). A snack can, of course, be as simple as popcorn jazzed up with nuts and raisins. Dinner? I could live on pasta with vegetables for weeks. You might try it, if only for a day.

If the M.R.I. scan that the neurosurgeon was pointing to was, as it appeared to me, a map of South America, the tumor in the brain of my wife, Denise, was the size of Brazil. Enormous, imposing, bulging all its borders, not to be denied.        


It was early October. Denise had not been herself for months. A cheerful and enthusiastic woman, dedicated to her family, her friends, her work, she had become distant, lethargic. Often fatigued, her interests and activities had diminished. Her co-workers had called asking if she was all right, her sisters had taken note, her friends could not understand the changes in her. I thought that she was tired, possibly depressed. I thought that maybe she was in a rut, that patience and empathy was needed.        
What was needed was surgery. After a fall at home from which she couldn’t rise we went to the emergency room where the questions, the examinations and an M.R.I. turned up what was wrong: Denise had a meningioma growing in the membrane between her brain and her skull. It had probably been growing for years and was now seven centimeters, of a size and weight that was affecting her vision, her functions, her balance, her personality.        
Denise was in the hospital for six weeks. She remained valiant and determined through three brain surgeries and intense physical and occupational therapy. She never faltered. She started therapy as soon as she could, from light bedside therapy, to participation from a wheelchair, through working with a walker, to walking with a cane. I observed one afternoon and was mightily impressed with Denise’s determination to get up and down the training steps, to swing in and out of the car door simulation, to work at it until she was too tired to continue. She wanted to give her all, as she has done since I’ve known her. Denise wanted to return to the people, the interests, the very life that she enjoyed and was missing.        
On the drives back and forth to the hospital, inspired by Denise, I found myself thinking quite a lot about the life that I had been missing, not just since her surgery but for the 35 years of our marriage. I am a survivor of severe sexual abuse that went on intermittently throughout my childhood. It happened, I know that it happened, and I have to live with it every day. When you grow up like that you are wary all the time; you rarely get close to anyone and you don’t go around having feelings where people can see them. My method of coping was my manner: low visibility, in and gone; distance. Denise saw through me and signed on anyway, when we were both young. I had never considered that I could be loved by anyone. When I met Denise I was, to my great benefit, open enough to understand that she was a person with whom I could share myself. I committed to her and to a life together. There have been only a few occasions in my life when I’ve looked and actually seen what was in front of me and fully felt the feelings I was feeling. One time was watching her walk down the aisle toward me, beaming, on our wedding day. I never looked away.        
Denise has been my partner, my confidant, my sentry at the gate. She has been the lover who has never blown my cover. I walked through my father’s wake with my arms crossed, always needing to be in another room. She shook hands and thanked people for coming. When our son was hospitalized with meningitis as a child she stayed overnight in his hospital room while I busied myself with errands at home and rehearsed how to visit him without seeming frightened. The therapy I endured trying to manage my memories nearly did me in, but Denise was there to listen if I needed to talk, or to sit by if I couldn’t. The rage, the alcohol, the detachment; I knew that she would be there when I got through it. And she was there, during and after and since.        
When she was able, Denise took a trip to Florida in February with her sister, who lost her home in Hurricane Sandy. It had been a goal to work toward, that these two sisters could sit together on a Florida balcony at sunset. And they did it. I went to pick them up at the airport when they returned and I saw Denise approaching from a distance, this little woman in a head scarf carefully negotiating her steps with her cane. When she looked up, saw me and smiled, I had that moment again that I knew what I knew and I felt what I felt: Here comes the love of my life, and I am so pleased and proud and lucky to be with her. I need to be visible, to participate, to feel and enjoy the rest of our time together, for as long as we’ve got.

Val Haller, a music-obsessed baby boomer and the founder of the Web site Valslist.com, matches tracks from her generation to those of her 20-something sons’ generation. 


“Going to California” is this week’s cover trip. I like featuring the less predictable, and pairing Led Zeppelin’s Robert Plant with a 47-year-old singer-songwriter, Martin Sexton, will probably surprise a lot of you. Mr. Sexton, from Syracuse, whose first guitar was bought at Sears, is the 10th of 12 children. That’s probably why getting along with people is a strong suit. I saw him at Park West in Chicago three years ago and the connection between artist and audience was plain to see. Read the fan reviews here.  In an interview with Brian Williams of NBC he describes why his live shows are different, and the approach he took when writing his ballad “Sugarcoating,” about 9/11, which Mr. Williams called a “superb little piece of art.”  Video by xxmusicheadxxLed Zeppelin - Going To CaliforniaVideo by etownradioshowMartin Sexton - ""Going To California"" (eTown webisode #377)Video by muzik1076Going To California-Robert Plant @ Taste of Chicago 7/12/2013 "

LONDON — The center of this city is bubbling like Champagne with the international superrich. While native Londoners fight with their umbrellas and dart into the Underground, across Mayfair and Knightsbridge, the cars of the wealthy purr up to shiny restaurants and their drivers stagger under the weight of branded bags from the day’s shopping haul.        


Tom Ford is after this high net worth crowd.        
They gathered on Sunday at his new Knightsbridge women’s store, where the black-chocolate dark stairway leads to a polished upper floor — all pink suede pumps and fluffy black and white furs. Fragrant with the perfumes wafting from the beauty area downstairs, this store is No. 89 of a rollout of 100 stores. Earlier this month came Chicago and Dallas (where else?).        
And so to the show. The décor with its mirrored walls (no gilt trip, as in last season’s fancy mansion) was Gucci redux. The show followed the exact template of “Tom” presentations: Outerwear, strong and body conscious, with a sexy vibe; pause; dim the lights; evening wear, soft, bondage-wrapped, with full-on sexiness.        
Then Mr. Ford himself, impeccably elegant in a form-fitting suit, takes his bow.        
And the clothes? For any woman who believes that the 1980s (preferably in Dallas) was the way to go, here was greed-is-good once again. The tan leather was soft, buttery, chevron-stitched, with the look of the seats in an über-expensive car. The skirts had high-rise hemlines on models who, by today’s waif standards, looked positively beefy. They strode out, in their fetish laced ankle boots, owning the world.        
But the big, curvy women sashaying down the runway were no babes. They looked like they might manage Russian mines or own petroleum plants in Baku. (And, yes, Mr. Ford already has a store in the wealthy capital of Azerbaijan.)        
There was a touch of the ’80s in dresses where bondage straps were crisscrossed over mesh to reveal skin. An impeccably tailored YSL-style tuxedo, its wool jacket morphing to shiny satin, led to a glitter gulch of shiny dresses, including metallic mesh with what looked like a wolf’s head woven into the neckline. These women were surely man-eaters.        
Among the whimsical, witty and ironic offerings of young London designers, the Ford show seemed like a fashion juggernaut. But he knows his woman and that she dresses to kill.

1913 Mr. Sulzer’s Trial to Begin 
NEW YORK — On the eve of the impeachment trial of Mr. Sulzer, the political situation is seething. The bitter feud between Tammany and the Governor will come to a focus to-morrow [Sept. 18]. As a sort of prelude the fact has been brought out that Mr. Sulzer tried to borrow $40,000 this week from Mr. Hugh Reilly, a contractor in Cuba, from whom he already had borrowed $26,000. It is estimated that the cost of the trial will be about $200,000. The primaries last night cleared the air so far as the city tickets are concerned. A very light vote was cast. The Republicans swallowed the Fusion ticket; Tammany’s ticket was ratified at the Democratic primaries, and the “yellow journal” ticket was accepted as a matter of course.        
 
1938 Cabinet Holds 5-Hour Session 
LONDON — At No. 10 Downing Street, at 11 o’clock tomorrow morning [Sept. 18], the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, and his Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, will consult with the French Premier, Edouard Daladier, and his Foreign Minister, Georges Bonnet, about the proper answer to be given to Chancellor Adolf Hitler’s peremptory demand that the Sudeten German areas of Czechoslovakia be annexed to the Reich with or without a plebiscite. With the issue of war or peace for Europe hanging in the balance one thing was clearly evident tonight. The Anglo-French axis is functioning smoothly. Britain and France have already agreed to make a joint and identical decision, whether it be a reluctant acceptance of Herr Hitler’s stiff terms or a firm refusal to be intimidated, or an effort once more to devise some sort of a compromise. For five hours, in two sessions this morning and afternoon, the British Cabinet considered the terms for peace laid down by Herr Hitler when Mr. Chamberlain paid his flying visit to Berchtesgaden.        
 
1963 Division on Phone-tapping

 
BONN — Chancellor Konrad Adenauer’s ruling coalition split today [Sept. 17] over a West German internal security agency’s use of Allied intelligence services to tap phones and open mail. The Free Democrats, whose votes give Dr. Adenauer’s Christian Democrats a Parliamentary majority, joined the opposition Social Democrats in demanding that the government refrain from asking the Allies to perform such activities in its behalf. Wire-tapping and mail-opening are prohibited by the constitution. But the United States, Britain and France retain the right to conduct such activities for intelligence purposes under the terms of the treaty granting West German sovereignty. The Social Democrats and the Free Democrats also demanded that the three Allied powers give up this right as soon as possible.

GENEVA — The United Nations experts investigating human rights conditions in North Korea said Tuesday that the “shocking” evidence they had collected from defectors and others suggested “large-scale” patterns of abuse that demanded an international response.        


The Human Rights Council pushed for the investigation in an attempt to bring new attention to allegations of horrifying abuses at the North’s infamous gulags that have been trickling out for years as more people have escaped the brutal police state. Until now, world powers including the United States had focused instead on attempts to dismantle the North’s nuclear weapons program.        
The chairman of the three-member Commission of Inquiry, Michael Donald Kirby, told reporters that the testimony he had heard in recent months evoked reactions similar to the discovery of concentration camps in Europe after World War II.        
He cited the statements of a former prisoner who said she had seen another woman forced to drown her baby in a bucket, and the account of a man who said he had collected and burned the bodies of prisoners who had died of starvation. Experts say the number of prisoners in gulags has dropped in recent years — to an estimated 120,000 or fewer from a possible high of 200,000 — but that might be partly because so many had died from forced labor and a lack of food.        
“The great value” of the report, said Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe, United States ambassador to the Human Rights Council, is that it “has begun to shed light on the horrifying realities of life in North Korea and raise international awareness of the ongoing tragedy and barbaric conditions there.” She also said the findings represented a “small but significant crack” in the North’s “information blockade.”        
The findings of the three-member Commission of Inquiry were part of an interim report to the council; the final report in March is expected to eventually be presented to the United Nations General Assembly.        
It remains unclear what actions the United Nations might take. Any referral to the International Criminal Court for human rights abuses would need to be approved by the Security Council, which includes North Korea’s longtime ally, China.        
Although China did not actively oppose the investigation, a senior Chinese diplomat in Geneva on Tuesday criticized the interim findings. “Politicized accusations and pressures are not helpful to improving human rights in any country,” Chen Chuandong said, according to Reuters. “On the contrary, they will only provoke confrontation and undermine the foundation and atmosphere for international human rights cooperation.”        
Mr. Kirby said the panel had submitted several requests seeking cooperation and access to North Korea, including a letter to the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, but the North Korean government said it “totally and categorically rejects the Commission of Inquiry.”        
A senior North Korean diplomat in Geneva, Kim Yong-ho, said Tuesday that the evidence cited by the panel had been “fabricated and invented” by forces hostile to North Korea, and dismissed the commission as “a hotbed of confrontation and distrust.”        
Mr. Kirby said that he had invited North Korea to provide hard evidence that refuted any of the testimony received, but that none was forthcoming.

TEHRAN — Iran’s supreme leader seemed to put his authority behind Iran’s moderate new president on Tuesday, calling for “heroic leniency” in navigating the country’s diplomatic dispute with the West.        


The president, Hassan Rouhani, was elected in June on a moderate platform of ending the nuclear standoff with the West and increasing personal freedoms. In a speech to the Revolutionary Guards, considered stalwarts of the conservative wing of the government, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said he was “not opposed to proper moves in diplomacy.”        
Enlarging on that theme, he said, “I agree with what I called ‘heroic leniency’ years ago, because such an approach is very good and necessary in certain situations, as long as we stick to our main principles.”        
In what may be a further signal that Mr. Rouhani’s victory in the June election has created a chance for intensified diplomacy, the country’s Foreign Ministry confirmed on Tuesday that he had exchanged letters with President Obama.        
But asked about the tone of Mr. Obama’s letter — something the Iranians are extremely sensitive about — Marzieh Afkham, the ministry spokeswoman, said Iran expected improvement in the way Washington talked to Iran.        
“Unfortunately, the U.S. administration is still adopting the language of threat while dealing with Iran,” Ms. Afkham said at a weekly news conference. “We have announced that this needs to change into the language of respect.”        
The United States and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since Washington ended ties after the seizure of 52 diplomatic personnel in 1979 after the Islamic revolution. Since his election, Mr. Rouhani has said he is interested in improving relations with the rest of the world, including the United States.        
Ms. Afkham said Mr. Obama had initiated the exchange of letters by congratulating Mr. Rouhani on his election victory. Mr. Rouhani “expressed thanks for the congratulations” and wrote about various issues, she said, without elaborating on what they were.        
Iran and the United States are at loggerheads over Tehran’s disputed nuclear program, and they are on opposing sides in Syria’s civil war. Iran is the most important regional ally of President Bashar al-Assad, while the United States supports the rebels seeking his ouster.        
Ms. Afkham said the letters had been sent through the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which has a section looking after American interests. In a television interview on Sunday, Mr. Obama also confirmed the exchange of letters.        
Word of the correspondence emerged as both leaders prepared to address the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week. Ms. Afkham said no meetings were scheduled between Iranian and United States officials. Mr. Rouhani will also not meet with the British foreign secretary, William Hague, she said, dismissing a message on a Twitter account affiliated with Mr. Rouhani asking for such a meeting.        
The exchange of letters also coincided with a decision by the Obama administration last week to ease longstanding restraints on humanitarian and good-will activities between Iran and the United States, including athletic exchanges. It was at least the second relaxation of Iranian sanctions this year by the American government.        
On another diplomatic front, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Tuesday that he would focus on halting Iran’s nuclear program in a meeting with Mr. Obama in Washington at the end of the month and in his annual speech before the United Nations General Assembly, using the Syria situation to increase pressure for a “credible military threat.”        
Repeating a four-step formula he has been urging for months, Mr. Netanyahu told his cabinet that Iran must stop enriching uranium, remove enriched uranium from the country, close its nuclear plant near Qum and stop what he called “the plutonium track.”        
“Until all four of these measures are achieved, the pressure on Iran must be increased and not relaxed, and certainly not eased,” the prime minister said in a statement released by his office.        
Negotiations intended to resolve the nuclear dispute have been deadlocked since before Mr. Rouhani’s election, which has been depicted as a potential opportunity to break the stalemate.        
Iran, arguing that its program is for peaceful purposes, insists on its right to enrich uranium. But Western powers fear that Tehran’s scientists are seeking the capability to build nuclear weapons, a prospect that alarms both the United States and Israel.        
Mr. Rouhani has not indicated whether Iran will shift positions, but he has replaced the most senior officials in the program. Last month, in their first report since Mr. Rouhani took office, nuclear inspectors from the United Nations said Iran had slowed its accumulation of uranium that could be quickly converted to bomb fuel.

WASHINGTON — A month before a murderous rampage at the Washington Navy Yard, Aaron Alexis called the police in Rhode Island to complain that he had changed hotels three times because he was being pursued by people keeping him awake by sending vibrations through the walls.        


When officers came to his hotel room early on Aug. 7, Mr. Alexis told them that a person he had argued with at an airport in Virginia “has sent three people to follow him” and that they were harassing him with a microwave machine, according to a Newport, R.I., police report. Mr. Alexis said he had heard “voices speaking to him through the wall, flooring and ceiling,” the report said.        
Mr. Alexis told the police he was a Navy contractor, and then twice that month he sought treatment from the Veterans Affairs Department for psychiatric issues, according to a senior law enforcement official. But it did not raise a red flag that might have prevented him from entering the military base in Washington where, the authorities say, he killed 12 people on Monday.        
On Wednesday, Mr. Alexis’s mother apologized to the victims in a brief statement she read from her Brooklyn home.        
“I don’t know why he did what he did, and I will never be able to ask him why,” Cathleen Alexis said. “Aaron is now in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone, and for that I am glad. To the families of the victims: I am so so very sorry that this happened. My heart is broken.”        
The episode in Rhode Island adds to a growing list of questions about how Mr. Alexis, who had a history of infractions as a Navy reservist, mental health problems and run-ins with the police over gun violence, gained and kept a security clearance from the Defense Department that gave him access to military bases, including the navy yard, where he was shot to death by the police.        
Time and again, Mr. Alexis’s behavior fell below a level that would have brought a serious response, like a less-than-honorable discharge from the military or involuntary commitment to a mental institution, experts and officials said.        
But the sheer number of episodes raises questions about the government’s system for vetting people for security clearances, including the thousands of contractors who help run the nation’s military and security system work. Though the cases are different, the access granted Mr. Alexis, a former Navy reservist who as an independent contractor serviced Navy computers, raises questions similar to those raised about another outside government contractor, Edward J. Snowden, who leaked national intelligence secrets.        
“These two incidents combined suggest to me a very flawed system for granting security clearances,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who called for a Congressional investigation into the granting of security clearances to government contractors. “Who knows how many other Snowdens and Aaron Alexises are out there?”        
On Tuesday, President Obama ordered the White House budget office to conduct a governmentwide review of policies for security clearances for contractors and employees in federal agencies. In an interview with Noticias Telemundo, the president said the nation did not have a “firm enough background check system.” He also called once again for Congress to enact legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with mental illness.        
“I do get concerned that this becomes a ritual that we go through every three, four months, where we have these horrific mass shootings,” he said.        
Senior Pentagon officials also said that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel intended to review physical security and access at all Defense Department installations around the world.        
Many planets aligned to place Mr. Alexis, 34, at the start of the workday in the navy yard with a Remington pump-action shotgun, firing down from a balcony, the police said, and killing the employees, all civilians.

Regarding “An anchorless world” (Globalist, Sept. 13) by Roger Cohen: As one who, along with a great majority of the American people, says enough is enough, I would like to make three points. One, our experience of going into a country to topple a hated dictator has not been met with gratitude; all sides in the Arab/Muslim world hate us, so we need to learn to give up that ghost. Two, if it’s so important for Turkey or Saudi Arabia to get rid of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, then let them do the fighting. Three, we have failed to put forth any sort of meaningful or realistic geopolitical strategy. I commend my fellow Americans for being far ahead of the president and the pundits on these issues.         
Melvin Vigman, Summit, New Jersey 
Cohen is clearly on the side of the hawks. His columns leave no doubt about that. To make his point he even gets back to his German sources, to World War II and postwar Berlin, but apparently not to the debacles of Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. These were all failures. An intervention in Syria could join the list.

Credibility is a prized word in international politics. Countries that keep their promises and enforce their red lines can be counted on to deter their enemies and assure their allies. Nations, as with human beings, develop reputations, and those that break their pledges are impossible to trust.         
As such, the failure of the United States to bomb Syria is bound to empower Iran and reinforce its quest for nuclear arms. The only problem with such assertions is that the historical record suggests that the so-called credibility argument rests on a very thin intellectual rail. America’s enemies put premium on its capabilities rather than indications of its resolve. It is Washington’s allies, however, that are likely to prove sensitive to its intentions as opposed to its actual power. The events of the past few weeks have probably impacted Israel more so than Iran.        
The most tragic application of the credibility argument for the United States was the Vietnam War. During Washington’s quarter of century involvement in Southeast Asia, successive administrations never claimed that Vietnam by itself was relevant for U.S. security, but that the failure to stop the advance of communism there was bound to embolden the Soviet Union. America fought in Vietnamese jungles to prove to the Kremlin that once the United States drew its red lines it would use all of its power to achieve its objectives. In one of the ironies of history, the collapse of U.S. efforts in Vietnam was followed a decade and a half later by the demise of the Soviet Union.        
The guardians of the theocratic state are clever men accustomed to sensing the subtleties of power. Although cavalier in their public pronouncements and bold in terms of their adventures in the Middle East, Iran’s military men do respect America’s armada assembled on their periphery. They know well that Washington is anxious to avoid a cascade of proliferation in the critical Gulf region. And they know that the United States has the military power to destroy their nuclear infrastructure. It is this calculus more so than America’s reticence in Syria that weighs on the minds of the mullahs.        
Given the fact that Iran appreciates U.S. power, how can one account for its nuclear truculence? Just because Tehran recognizes the reality of American strength that does not mean that Iran will readily acquiesce to its mandates. The clerical leaders have their own version of two-track policy to forestall an American attack. On the one hand, they point to their deterrent capability — terrorist allies such as Hezbollah are emphasized and the notion of inflicting damage on America’s military and diplomatic personnel is subtly stressed.        
At the same time, Iran has entangled the United States in a prolonged diplomatic process that has successfully deferred a military response. Iran’s diplomatic track has been complemented by a charm offensive emphasizing its readiness to arrive at a mutually satisfactory settlement. It is very hard for Washington to justify a strike on Iran given the probability of retaliation and Tehran’s seeming willingness to resolve the issue at the negotiating table.        
While not bombing Syria may not have had a measurable impact on Iran’s calculations, it is likely to condition Israel’s response to the Islamic Republic’s nuclear imbroglio. For Israelis, as with all small powers measuring the reliability of their superpower patron, intentions matter more than capabilities. It is not America’s actual military power but its willingness to use that power that impresses its allies. What Israelis have seen of late is a Washington that, faced with a violation of its red line on the use of weapons of mass destruction, embraces a Russian effort at the United Nations Security Council. There are no two entities with less credibility in Jerusalem on the issue of unconventional weapons than Russia and the United Nations.        
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his hawkish advisers may yet conclude that any forceful resolution of the Iran crisis requires Israel acting alone. Whatever the probabilities of Israeli bombing Iran’s facilities may have been prior to the Syrian crisis, those numbers have only gone up.        
The recent Syrian melodrama indicates how little historical assessments penetrate governmental deliberations. The notion that we have to bomb Damascus to impress Tehran is short-sighted and without much analytical underpinning. There may be ample justification for the use of force against a regime that has used chemical weapons against unarmed citizens. Indeed, the tragedy of the Syrian civil war has long called out for a more determined international effort. However, in assessing the effect of the recent crisis one has to conclude that its impact will be felt more in Israel than in Iran.

LONDON — The silver Maserati arrived at the Diagonal, the wide avenue in Barcelona.        


“Watch now,” said the driver, “I’ll beat all the lights except the last.”        
There were eight sets of traffic lights in an 800-meter, or 2,600-foot, stretch. The first seven were passed while they were still green.        
The year was 1974. The man at the wheel was Johan Cruyff. And the car symbolized the way he was — and is — lean, quicksilver fast and forever challenging the limitations around him.        
This Wednesday evening, Barcelona plays Ajax Amsterdam in the Champions League. It will be the first competitive meeting of the two clubs that Cruyff helped to make great — helped, indeed, to exhibit some of the most mellifluous styles in the global game.        
He was born in Amsterdam and has lived in Barcelona for more than half his 66 years, yet Cruyff has vowed not to be in the Camp Nou stadium on Wednesday. “I will support Ajax,” he said on RTL television in the Netherlands. “I have had some differences with Barça’s president, and I will not set foot in the Camp Nou as long as he is there.”        
This, too, is symptomatic of Johan Cruyff. There is his way of doing things, and any other way has to be wrong. The vast majority of the 710 games he played and the 401 goals he scored were for Ajax or Barcelona or the Netherlands national team.        
He even chose Catalonia’s team as his second club because it represented the opposition to Francisco Franco’s dictatorship in Spain. But to Cruyff, life was what he could control on the field.        
He was born close to the Ajax stadium in the east of Amsterdam, his mother was a cleaner at the club and he was drawn into the youth system there.        
Even before Rinus Michels, the stern trainer at Ajax (and later at Barcelona) became known as the Father of Total Football, Cruyff was known for expressing all the skills of every position. He expressed them through movement, and very much through his outspoken opinions.        
When he spoke too much, the coaches would threaten to fine him or, worse, send him home. But they, even Michels, were inspired by the beauty of Cruyff’s belief that soccer need not be a sport of fixed positional play or stereotypical patterns.        
When we watched Lionel Messi thrive in the Barça team coached by Pep Guardiola a couple of seasons ago, this was Cruyff’s soccer. He was the coach who gave Guardiola his debut as a player, and whose 1992 “Barcelona Dream Team” set the seed for the Barça of today.        
Cruyff was its coach, the head coach of the entire club from the academy up.        
Guardiola was the captain of a side that featured José Maria Bakero, Txiki Begiristain, Gheorghe Hagi, Michael Laudrup, Romário, Hristo Stoichkov and the inevitable Dutch connection, Ronald Koeman.        
And where Ajax with Cruyff the player triumphed in the old European Cup, he later coached Barcelona to the same title.        
Even today the Catalan-Dutch connection is maintained. Frank De Boer, the current Ajax coach, played for Barcelona from 1999 to 2003.        
Economics have determined that the modern Ajax is no longer as flamboyant or as competitive as the one that Cruyff led to European glory. It still has its youth system, but Barça’s is bigger, better and able to augment its graduates with world-class imports.        
Neymar cost Barcelona the better part of €100 million, about $134 million, once the transfer payment to his Brazilian club Santos and his salary over the length of his contract are taken into account. Cruyff’s transfer fee when he left Ajax for Barcelona was also in the tens of millions — but in pesetas, the former Spanish currency, and worth about $2 million.        
It was another time, another valuation, and even the Maserati was then around $10,000 worth of extravagance.        
What hasn’t changed, in Cruyff’s eyes, is that soccer is just a game.        
Driven by commerce, but it is still a game that in his case came from the street, and from his vision.        
Neymar and Messi might be aspiring Cruyff-like figures licensed to thrill.        
But one of Cruyff’s differences with Barcelona’s president, Sandro Rosell, is that the Dutchman doesn’t believe the team needed Neymar.        
Cruyff’s opinion, stated on TV and in newspaper columns, is that Neymar and Messi duplicate rather than complement each other.        
The signs of the past few weeks have suggested otherwise, although Neymar has gone to great lengths to forego his own scoring opportunities while he tries to set up Messi.        
That might be the Brazilian’s way of showing he knows his place in the pecking order in Catalonia and that he is biding time before seeking a leading role.        
Ajax, alas, comes without any comparable star. It had a promising young playmaker, the Dane Christian Eriksen, but it sold him this month to Tottenham Hotspur for about $18 million.        
That money is lifeblood to Ajax, but since Eriksen left, the team has lost its rhythm. “If Messi has seen images of the way we played at the weekend,” said Coach De Boer, “I doubt he’s too concerned.”        
Cruyff, who has fallen out with the board members running both his former clubs, has become the great outsider.        
He thinks Rosell, the president of Barça, is too mercenary. And he is blames the coach for the way that Ajax struggles. “Just because someone has a driving license,” Cruyff said of De Boer, “doesn’t mean he is capable of driving a Formula One car.”        
Straight to the point, like his straight-line driving 39 years ago in Barcelona.

Back in January, Louis Vuitton asked the Indonesian street artist Eko Nugroho to help design a new scarf. The luxury brand has become a master of these kind of collaborations, which have come to be known as “artketing” — combining the world of fine art with mass consumer marketing — but it has tended toward artists who are more established internationally, like Takashi Murakami, Richard Prince and most recently Yayoi Kusama. The decision to select Mr. Nugroho was a sign of his quick rise.        


It’s not the only one. This year, Mr. Nugroho, 36, who recently made the list of Art + Auction magazine’s “Top 50 under 50,” is participating in the Indonesian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, which runs through Nov. 24.        
Mr. Nugroho mixes pop influences with Indonesian motifs and touches on issues of identity and democracy.        
For the Louis Vuitton collaboration, Mr. Nugroho created six large oil paintings, with the brand selecting one for production — “Republik Tropis,” which portrays a mythical creature whose body is made of tropical fruits and vegetables, with two masked faces peering through the twisted amalgamation.        
“This creature is like a compilation of the democratic idea in Indonesia, colorful and complicated, a symbol of today’s society,” Mr. Nugroho said in a recent interview in Singapore. “Our democracy is still very young, not fixed yet.”        
Masks are integral to Mr. Nugroho’s visual vocabulary, and he started using them in his practice in 2000. In Indonesia, he said, they are “more about the concept of identity and the concealment of your true human nature.”        
Mr. Nugroho is part of a generation of artists that emerged as the dictatorial Suharto regime was falling and Indonesia was slowly transitioning toward democracy; and from the start, he has used his works to communicate and engage with a general public, particularly through street art.        
“I like to develop my work outside during daylight. It’s more free and flexible and it allows me to interact with people, sometime asking them to help,” he said. For his new solo exhibition, called “We Are What We Mask,” which opened at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute last week, masks take center stage. Inspired by Gillian Vogelsang-Eastwood and Willem Vogelsang’s “Covering the Moon: An Introduction to Middle Eastern Face Veils,” which retraces the history of veils, Mr. Nugroho has created 70 colorful paper works, many of which are wearable. They include a series of 10 flat masks that take on the shape of the head covering worn by the women of the Rashaida tribe in Saudi Arabia, and a series of eight full-face head pieces in absurd shapes and bright neon hues that were made from abaca cotton paper treated with konnyaku, a form of Japanese root- based gelatin, to add strength. All these “face veils” include text like “obey and happy” and “prohibited to prohibited” that take on a specific meaning within the Singaporean context where they were created.        
“I like strong visuals. I’ve never used such strong colors before, sometime they are hurting the eyes, but the underlying idea is still about democracy and the freedom,” he said.        
Dan Cameron, the chief curator at the Orange County Museum of Art in California, noted in his essay for the Singapore Tyler Print Institute’s exhibition catalog: “For all his potential for caustic observation and critique, Eko is an extremely funny and inventive artist, whose animated forms and characters locate him about midway on the scale between Kenny Scharf and Takashi Murakami, with an added dimension of playful gore to bring it into the contemporary visual idiom of zombies and apocalyptic fantasy.” Mr. Nugroho is also participating in the 2013 California-Pacific Triennial, running through Nov. 17, which Mr. Cameron curated.        
Mr. Nugroho’s works were completed during a six-week residency that challenged the technical capabilities of the Singapore institute’s workshop, as it was the first time staff there had sewn paper and assembled such complex forms.        
“There is a magic in transforming a two-dimensional surface into a three-dimensional object, so one of the significant achievements was making paper which is strong, durable, yet flexible to make these fabric-like mask pieces,” said the Singapore institute’s chief printer, Eitaro Ogawa, who added that “we worked intensely with wood carvings for this project to give a new boldness and unique character to Eko’s line imagery, usually drawn by the artist in brushstrokes.”        
As an additional challenge to the Singapore institute’s staff, Mr. Nugroho asked them to each select their favorite head piece and arrange for themselves to be photographed wearing it in everyday Singaporean scenes – riding the MRT subway, waiting in line at a taxi stand or at a food center. The resulting photographs are also on view.        
The coming months will be busy for the artist: He is opening a solo show in October at Arario Gallery in Seoul, and has plans for a solo show at the Lombard Freid Gallery in New York next year. “The new work at Arario is going to be totally different, black and white, so quite a big change,” he said. For New York, he’s hoping to explore more installation works, with video and murals. “I like to be part of the landscape,” he said with a laugh.

TOKYO — Eiji Toyoda, who as a member of Toyota Motor’s founding family and an architect of its “lean manufacturing” method helped turn the automaker into a global powerhouse and changed the face of modern manufacturing, died on Tuesday in Toyota City, Japan, where the company has its headquarters. He was 100.        


His death, at the Toyota Memorial Hospital, was caused by heart failure, the company said in a statement.        
Mr. Toyoda, a nephew of the Toyota Group founder, Sakichi Toyoda, was president of Toyota from 1967 to 1982 and continued as chairman and then as adviser until his death. In almost six decades with the company, he helped transform a tiny spinoff of a textile loom maker into the world’s biggest automaker.        
Early on he helped put Toyota at the forefront of a wave of automobile production in Japan, pushing it to bolster its lineup, first by adding compact vehicles and sports cars in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1980s, he initiated the development of luxury models to compete with the likes of Mercedes-Benz and BMW, culminating with the Lexus brand in 1989.        
Mr. Toyoda also pushed Toyota’s expansion overseas, helping to establish the company’s joint factory with General Motors in Fremont, Calif. The plant, known as Nummi, introduced Japanese lean-production methods to the United States as part of a migration of Japanese auto manufacturing to American soil. The company’s manufacturing efficiencies have helped maintain Toyota’s status as one of the top auto manufacturers and employers in the world.        
Nummi closed in 2010. It is now the site of a factory that makes the electric car trailblazer Tesla.        
In the early 1990s, Mr. Toyoda, known as a man of few words, gave voice to a sense of crisis inside the company as Japan’s economic growth sputtered. He argued that Toyota needed to change the way it made cars if it hoped to survive in the 21st century. His urgings prompted the development of the popular Prius gas-electric hybrid, the manufacturing expert Satoshi Hino wrote in the 2005 book “Inside the Mind of Toyota.”        
Mr. Toyoda was born on Sept. 12, 1913, near Nagoya in central Japan, the second son of Heikichi and Nao Toyoda. He spent much of his youth at his family’s textile mill and took an early interest in machines, he said in his 1988 autobiography, “Toyota: Fifty Years in Motion.” He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1936 with a mechanical engineering degree and joined his family’s loom business.        
The next year, Kiichiro Toyoda, son of the founder, created Toyota Motor, taking the young Eiji Toyoda with him.        
Assigned to a division devoted to resolving quality problems, Mr. Toyoda is said to have developed an uncanny ability to spot waste.        
“Problems are rolling all around in front of your eyes,” Mr. Toyoda said of those days in “Inside the Mind of Toyota.” “Whether you pick them up and treat them as problems is a matter of habit. If you have the habit, then you can do whatever you have a mind to.”        
In 1950, he set out on what would turn out to be a pivotal three-month tour to survey Ford’s Rouge plant in Detroit, then the largest and most efficient factory in the world. Before World War II, the military government prevented Toyota from building passenger cars, compelling it to make trucks for Japan’s war effort instead.        
By 1950, Toyota had produced just 2,685 automobiles, compared with the 7,000 vehicles the Rouge plant was rolling out in a single day, according to “The Machine That Changed the World,” a 1990 study by James P. Womack, Daniel T. Jones and Daniel Roos.        
Mr. Toyoda was unfazed, writing back to headquarters that he “thought there were some possibilities to improve the production system.” He brought back a thick booklet that outlined some of Ford’s quality-control methods; the company translated it into Japanese, changing “Ford” to “Toyota” in all references.        
Mr. Toyoda went on to oversee Toyota’s Motomachi plant, a huge undertaking that gave the automaker the capacity to produce 5,000 passenger vehicles a month at a time when all of Japan produced about 7,000 vehicles a month. The plant, completed in 1959, was soon running at full capacity and gave Toyota a decisive lead over its domestic rival Nissan and the confidence to turn its eyes overseas.        
Even as he aggressively expanded production at Toyota, Mr. Toyoda applied a manufacturing culture based on concepts like “kaizen,” a commitment to continuous improvements suggested by the workers themselves, and just-in-time production, a tireless effort to eliminate waste. Those ideas became a core part of what came to be called the Toyota Production System and a corporate ethos known as the Toyota Way.        
“One of the features of the Japanese workers is that they use their brains as well as their hands,” he said in an interview with the author Masaaki Imai for the 1986 book “Kaizen.” “Our workers provide 1.5 million suggestions a year, and 95 percent of them are put to practical use. There is an almost tangible concern for improvement in the air at Toyota.”        
The methods Mr. Toyoda nurtured have had global influence. Though Toyota long guarded its manufacturing techniques, the company came to recognize a broader interest in its model and has offered consulting services to manufacturers outside the automotive industry and to nonprofit organizations. As part of its community service programs, Toyota now trains workers at the Food Bank for New York City in ways to optimize flow and quality through streamlining and enhancing performance.        
In 1994, the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Mich., inducted Mr. Toyoda for his contributions to car manufacturing. He was the second honoree from Japan, after the founder of Honda Motor, Soichiro Honda.        
“Ever since Toyota’s establishment in 1937, I have been involved in this wonderful business, and as long as my engine keeps running, I intend to give back as much as I can for the industry’s further development,” Mr. Toyoda said in a statement at the time.        
Mr. Toyoda is survived by his three sons, Kanshiro, Tetsuro and Shuhei, and a daughter, Sonoko. His wife, Kazuko, died in 2002.        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 21, 2013An obituary on Wednesday about Eiji Toyoda, using information from Toyota Motor, which his family founded and which he headed as president from 1967 to 1982, omitted a survivor. Besides his sons Kanshiro, Tetsuro and Shuhei, he is survived by a daughter, Sonoko.

CARDIFF, Wales — Donizetti never thought of his three operas about Tudor queens as a trilogy and scarcely anyone else did either until the soprano Beverly Sills sang them at the New York City Opera in the 1970s. Each with a libretto by a different author, they were premiered over a seven-year period (1830-1837) in different Italian theaters, with different singers as the royal protagonists: Giuditta Pasta (“Anna Bolena”), Maria Malibran (“Maria Stuarda”) and Giuseppina Ronzi de Begnis (Elizabeth I in “Roberto Devereux”).        


The stories, familiar from both history and literary fabrications, are far apart chronologically. Yet each culminates in an execution — Anne Boleyn’s in 1536 at the behest of her husband, Henry VIII, for, among other things, alleged infidelity; Mary Stuart’s in 1587 because of the threat she posed to Elizabeth I’s rule; and Robert Devereux’s in 1601, for treason. At the heart of each plot are one or more love triangles, whether rooted in reality or invented.        
Authentic or not, the Tudor Trilogy is happily with us, for these are fine operas. Choosing a favorite is not easy — mine tends to be the one I have encountered most recently in a convincing performance. As with Wagner’s “Ring,” opera companies often mount the individual operas gradually, but the intrepid Welsh National Opera, now in its third season under the noted stage director David Pountney’s leadership, is currently introducing them in new productions at the Wales Millennium Center within the space of just a month. “Anna Bolena” and “Maria Stuarda” are now in repertory, with “Roberto Devereux” to follow on Oct. 7.        
The ambitious schedule imposes challenges on the company’s production and musical capabilities, from which it does not emerge unscathed, but the burden is lessened by having the same set serve for all three operas — a functional black box designed by Madeleine Boyd. She also designed the prevailingly black costumes, which have details suggestive both of Tudor and of more recent times. In addition, responsibilities are shared by two directors and two conductors: Alessandro Talevi and Daniele Rustioni for “Anna Bolena” and “Roberto Devereux,” Rudolf Frey and Graeme Jenkins for “Maria Stuarda.”        
Only two characters, Elizabeth I and her stern adviser, William Cecil, appear in more than one opera. But Mr. Talevi’s powerful staging ingeniously allows Elizabeth to appear in all three operas by showing her mother, Anne Boleyn, in the aftermath of giving birth to the future monarch at the start of “Anna Bolena.” Not only does this introduce us to the woman whose dictates dominate the succeeding operas, but the issue of Elizabeth’s illegitimate birth is brought to the fore.        
Prior to her marriage, Anne was betrothed to Henry Percy, news of which enrages the operatic Henry by casting doubt on the legitimacy of his marriage to Anne and — as he alludes to in words that are easily overlooked — also reflecting adversely on his infant daughter.        
It all constitutes telling preparation for the famous (if fictionalized) confrontation between the two queens in “Maria Stuarda,” when Mary, held as Elizabeth’s prisoner and tormented beyond endurance by her insults, denounces her publicly as “the sullied daughter of Boleyn” and a “vile bastard.” Sadly, Mr. Frey’s staging falls short of doing that opera justice. Within the black-box set, another box serves as Mary’s prison cell; Elizabeth appears in it dejectedly at the end, thereby drawing a parallel between the two queens. But the device doesn’t help the action, which is marred elsewhere by such distractions as Mary smoking a cigarette in her entrance aria and an embarrassing foot-washing episode during the moving scene in which Mary’s supporter, George Talbot, receives her confession according to Catholic tenets.        
Musically, too, “Anna Bolena” comes off better. The soprano Serena Farnocchia may not be the most charismatic of Annas, but her singing is consistently attractive and, in facing rejection, death and temporary madness, she deals with Anna’s overwhelming final scene grippingly, sometimes couched in Elizabeth’s crib.

LONDON — The London theater is in a fearsome mood these days, whether on large stages or small.        


Indeed, during a recent week of playgoing, I learned that goodness is nothing more than another word for cowardice, that same-sex affections are likely to end in something far bloodier than tears, and that even a pet guinea pig isn’t immune from the brutishness coursing through the capital’s stages of late.        
The best-known of these scenarios has arrived courtesy of Christopher Marlowe, a contemporary of Shakespeare — they were born the same year — who may not quite possess his colleague’s unequivocal lyricism but who also knew a thing or two about the price paid for kingship gone awry.        
“Edward II” remains one of Marlowe’s best-known texts, and it is often paired in conversation (and sometimes in performance) with “Richard II,” Shakespeare’s eternally rhapsodic yet mournful history play. But while the Royal Shakespeare Company primes “Richard II” for a new production later this fall, the National has got in first with an “Edward II” that is sure to divide spectators on every front but one — the superb performance of the fast-ascending actor John Heffernan in the title role.        
In fact, the modish approach taken by the director Joe Hill-Gibbins, marking his National debut, won’t surprise those familiar with his esteemed track record at the Young Vic, where Mr. Hill-Gibbins directed two separate accounts of “The Changeling,” the Jacobean tragedy that occupies much the same take-no-prisoners landscape as “Edward II.”        
But whereas that staging placed the audience behind netting and allowed the actors as required to cover one another with varying kinds of glop (chocolate! jam!), his “Edward” blurs the distinction between theater and film by presenting sizable swaths of the action on screens that flank the Olivier auditorium.        
Sometimes, the conceit makes perfect sense: In a narrative rife with backstairs intrigue, why not grant us access to the goings-on backstage? At other times, it feels like a distraction too far.        
It’s difficult to argue too much, however, with a tactic that keeps playgoers apprised at every turn of Mr. Heffernan’s keenly sensitized portrayal, Edward’s downward spiral made doubly plain by scene titles informing us of the grim trajectory of the piece as it is happening. Even acting behind a beard in what must be the most hirsute production in memory, the actor awakens us to Edward’s grievous surrender to the sleep-deprived torment that soon after leads to his gruesome demise.        
A benchmark work in the canon of gay-themed drama, “Edward II” spends much of its first half obsessing about the banishment of Edward’s lowly beloved, Gaveston, who is no sooner expelled from view than the king is demanding his return. Playing what amounts to a human yo-yo, the London-based American actor Kyle Soller gets to act in his own accent — a clever way of separating Gaveston out from the array of nobles and the like who have no time for him. (Mr. Soller was an Olivier nominee this past spring for his West End performance in Eugene O’Neill’s “Long Day’s Journey Into Night.”)        
Mr. Soller’s various entrances also help lend an intimacy to the largest of the National’s three venues while presumably functioning as their own aerobics class. This is the Elizabethan theater at once juiced up and in your face. Traditionalists will be dismayed, but the rapt matinee crowd among whom I sat one recent afternoon took it in their stride.        
Across town at the Royal Court, the primary theater for new writing has got its new season off to a scarcely less contentious start. “The Ritual Slaughter of Gorge Mastromas” — Gorge in this instance is pronounced as if it were George — springs from the febrile imagination of Dennis Kelly, the British playwright who won a Tony in June for his book for the musical “Matilda.”

TOMS RIVER, N.J. — Investigators have determined that the devastating fire that consumed several blocks of the Boardwalk in nearby Seaside Park last week was caused by an electrical wiring problem, and was not set intentionally.        


But the hidden culprit may well have been Hurricane Sandy.        
On Tuesday, county officials declared the fire accidental, saying it was caused by a malfunction of electrical wiring that may have been compromised by water and sand from the hurricane last fall.        
The Ocean County prosecutor, Joseph D. Coronato, said he would close the criminal investigation into the fire because the team of local, state and federal investigators had “unanimously determined” that it had not been started intentionally. Indeed, he added, the sand piled up under the Boardwalk left the spot where the fire broke out “completely inaccessible” to humans.        
“Today, I can confidently bring some sense of closure to this tragic event,” Mr. Coronato said, adding that during Hurricane Sandy, the wiring was fully submerged and “degradation of these wires occurred.”        
Jessica Gotthold, a senior special agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said the wires were live when the fire broke out just after 2 p.m. on Thursday. She said the investigators had pinpointed the location of the problem with the wiring and found that it was the only possible source of heat there.        
The fire started near a small building that housed a Kohr’s frozen custard stand and a candy shop, she said. Winds that gusted to 30 miles per hour quickly spread the flames along the wooden pilings that held up the Boardwalk, igniting dozens of shops and arcades.        
Local residents who were near the Boardwalk at the time said the fire appeared to gain speed when it reached segments where the sand had shifted after the hurricane and left pockets of air beneath the planks. Al Della Fave, a spokesman for the prosecutor’s office, said the investigators described a “flueing effect” that drew the fire up the Boardwalk.        
Cheryl Raley, the owner of a Seaside Park motel who was on the Boardwalk just after the fire started, used the term “chimney effect” to describe how the fire spread northward. She said Hurricane Sandy had “chewed out” the sand under the Boardwalk, creating openings for the wind to fan the flames.        
In all, the blaze reduced almost all of the commercial section of the Boardwalk in Seaside Park to ashes. It jumped over one trench the firefighters cut in an effort to stop it, and burned a section of the Boardwalk in neighboring Seaside Heights.        
Also lost was the Funtown Pier, which extended toward the ocean and contained rides that attracted children in droves. The pier was significantly damaged in the hurricane and did not reopen for the summer season this year.        
The prosecutor’s finding clears the way for the owners of the ruined businesses, including William Majors, who owns the pier, to seek payments from insurance policies. Mr. Coronato said it afforded them “the ability to now take measures to rebuild and recover.”        
Gov. Chris Christie has promised $15 million for businesses damaged by the fire, out of the money earmarked for storm repairs. He pledged to press insurance companies to expedite the fire claims so that rebuilding can get under way. On Tuesday, he said that the state would allow businesses affected by the fire to postpone sales tax payments that would have been due this month.        
Ms. Raley, who owns the Charlroy Motel, said that her business could not survive a summer without the Boardwalk. She said that while her motel was not damaged by the fire, she had already spent $87,000 repairing storm damage and had not received any payments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or any other source to offset those costs.        
“The money has to come like really, really fast” to save the businesses that burned, Ms. Raley said. “If you miss a season, you’re done.”        
Mr. Coronato said the investigators spent 40 hours in an exhaustive effort to address the rumors that the fire seemed suspicious. They even brought in police dogs trained to detect gasoline and other chemicals used to accelerate fires. One of the dogs panted through the news conference held in the main branch of the Ocean County Library to announce the findings.        
Mr. Coronato said they looked into any financial incentives people might have had to set a fire, but he declined to provide any details on what they learned.        
Instead, he focused on the absence of any evidence that the source of the fire could have been anything other than a wiring problem. He said the wiring might have been in place for decades and “could have failed on its own.”        
But he said it had been submerged during the hurricane and, because it was inaccessible, “obviously” had not been inspected since the storm. Failing to check the wires may not have been wise, he said, but “it’s certainly not criminal in nature.”        
He declined to say whether he suspected that other stretches of Boardwalk along the state’s shoreline were susceptible to similar fires. But he recommended that all owners of property affected by Hurricane Sandy have their electrical systems inspected.

The stock market rose on Tuesday as investors awaited word from the Federal Reserve about scaling back its economic stimulus.         
Many expect the Fed to announce on Wednesday that it will reduce its $85 billion monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. Wall Street is hoping for a small reduction because the bond-buying has kept interest rates very low, contributing to this year’s strong rally in stocks.        
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 34.95 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 15,529.73, giving it an 18.5 percent gain for the year so far.        
The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index advanced 7.16 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,704.76. The S.& P. 500 was five points below its record high reached on Aug. 2, with a year-to-date increase of 19.5 percent.        
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 27.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,745.70, putting it up 24 percent so far this year.        
Rising technology stocks included the video game company Electronic Arts, which is getting a solid start with this year’s edition of its Madden football franchise. Electronic Arts rose 64 cents, or 2 percent, to $27.60. After the market closed, the company named the head of its sports games, Andrew Wilson, as its chief executive.        
The computer memory maker Micron Technology rose 40 cents, or 2 percent, to $16.84 as investors bet that memory prices would rise after a fire shut down a competitor’s factory in China.        
By some measures, stock market values are as high as they were at the end of the Internet bubble in 2000, when compared to the size of the nation’s economy, said Martin Leclerc, a principal and chief investment officer at Barrack Yard Advisors.        
Then, the justification was new technology.“Now, the only justification we have is cheap money,” Mr. Leclerc said.        
Nonetheless, he said, with a bull market under way, stocks could keep climbing regardless of valuations. “This thing is a powerful beast,” he said. The current bull market is four and a half years old.        
The shares of a few companies benefited from large investments.        
Safeway, a major grocery store chain, jumped $2.95, or 10.5 percent, to $30.99 after saying an unidentified investor had bought a significant amount of its stock. Safeway said it had adopted a “poison pill” defense measure to thwart any hostile takeover attempt.        
Aéropostale climbed $1.56, or 18 percent, to $10.17 after Sycamore Partners disclosed an 8 percent stake in the teenage clothing retailer. And Huntsman, a chemical maker, gained 36 cents, or 2 percent, to $19.50 after saying it would pay $1.1 billion for two businesses from Rockwood Holdings, which rose 60 cents, or 1 percent, to $67.21.        
Abercrombie & Fitch rode Aéropostale’s coattails, moving up $1.09, or 3 percent, to $38.43.        
Among the stocks on the move, Microsoft rose after announcing a 22 percent dividend increase and a $40 billion stock buyback program. Microsoft gained 13 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $32.93, after trading as high as $33.47.        
Boeing rose $1.44, or 1.2 percent, to $117.11 as a stretched version of its new 787 flew for the first time. Boeing’s gain was responsible for one-third of the Dow’s rise.        
Outerwall, which owns the Redbox DVD kiosks, plunged $6.48, or almost 12 percent, to $49.49 after slashing its outlook because of weaker-than-expected demand for discs.        
In the bond market, interest rates showed little change ahead of the conclusion of the Fed’s policy-making meeting. The price of the Treasury’s 10-year note advanced 3/32, to 97, while its yield slipped to 2.85 percent from 2.86 percent late Monday.

WASHINGTON — Despite the addition of more than two million jobs last year, soaring corporate profits and continuing economic growth, income for the typical American household did not rise in 2012 and poverty failed to fall, new data from the Census Bureau show.        


“The poverty and income numbers are a metaphor for the entire economy,” said Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution. “Everything’s on hold, but at a bad level.”        
Over a longer perspective, the figures reveal that the income of the median American household today, adjusted for inflation, is no higher than it was for the equivalent household in the late 1980s.        
For all but the most highly educated and affluent Americans, incomes have stagnated, or worse, for more than a decade. The census report found that median household income, adjusted for inflation, was $51,017 in 2012, down about 9 percent from an inflation-adjusted peak of $56,080 in 1999, mostly as a result of the longest and most damaging recession since the Depression. Most people have had no gains since the economy hit bottom in 2009.        
The government’s authoritative annual report on incomes, poverty and health insurance, released Tuesday, underscores that the economic recovery has largely failed to reach the poor and the middle class, even as the unemployment rate continues to sink and growth has returned.        
Government programs remain a lifeline for millions. Unemployment insurance, whose eligibility the federal government expanded in response to the downturn, kept 1.7 million people out of poverty last year. Food stamps, if counted as income, would have kept out four million.        
Since the recession ended in 2009, income gains have accrued almost entirely to the top earners, the Census Bureau found. The top 5 percent of earners — households making more than about $191,000 a year — have recovered their losses and earned about as much in 2012 as they did before the recession. But those in the bottom 80 percent of the income distribution are generally making considerably less than they had been, hit by high rates of unemployment and nonexistent wage growth.        
Moreover, economists believe that the report understates the degree of income inequality in the United States, by not including, among other things, earnings from capital gains made on rising stock prices.        
In one glimmer of improvement, the number of men working full time year-round with earnings increased by one million from 2011 to 2012, to a total of 59 million. Still, the labor market continues to look weak, in particular for less-educated and lower-income men. The labor force participation rate of men has fallen steadily for the past 60 years. In no small part, that is because the median earnings of men working full time have not increased in real terms since the early 1970s.        
For women, the earnings stall started about a decade ago, when the gender pay gap stopped closing. “The wage gap hasn’t budged a penny,” said Fatima Goss Graves of the National Women’s Law Center. “After 11 years of no progress on equal pay, policy makers need to get moving to improve the country’s pay discrimination laws, raise the minimum wage and remove the barriers women face in higher-wage jobs.”        
The West was the only region that experienced a statistically significant increase in median income, the Census Bureau said, while all other regions were flat. That most likely reflects the relatively strong growth in Washington, Oregon, California and Utah last year. North Dakota, experiencing an oil and gas boom, is the fastest-growing state, though its population is so small that it barely affects the national statistics.        
No racial or ethnic group experienced significant changes in income, but that left the gap between Asians, at the top, and blacks, at the bottom, as wide as before. The median income for Asian households was $68,600. For non-Hispanic whites, it was about $57,000, while the typical Hispanic household had an income of $39,000, and blacks were at $33,300.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Salvador Perez was 16 and living in Venezuela when he signed with the Kansas City Royals for $65,000 in 2006. He knew the Royals played major league baseball, he said Monday, but not much else. That was probably for the best.        


“I feel so happy when I signed,” Perez said by his locker at Kauffman Stadium. “But after that, we have to go through some process to make it.”        
Process has been the buzzword here for years, a plea from the front office to a restless fan base. The Royals have gone longer without a postseason appearance than any other team in the four major American professional sports, a drought that stretches to their victory in the 1985 World Series. Trust the process, the team has said, and at last, the results are showing.        
The Royals, at 79-72, are fighting for one of the American League’s two wild-card spots. After splitting the first two games of their series this week with the Cleveland Indians, they are tied with the Yankees at three and a half back, trailing Cleveland and Baltimore for the spots held by Tampa Bay and Texas.        
“This is what baseball’s all about,” said starter James Shields, who struck out 10 in six innings in a victory Monday. “This is where we want to be. We can pull it off, absolutely. We’ve just got to keep winning games.”        
The crowd was enthusiastic Monday — one man reveled in jiggling his supersize gut for the cameras — but just 15,413 fans showed up under threatening skies. The crowd was bigger Tuesday, but the Royals are averaging only 21,340 per game, down a bit from last season, when they hosted the All-Star Game. They have not averaged 25,000 since 1991.        
Dayton Moore, the general manager, grew up here in the glory years of the 1970s and 1980s, rooting for the Royals. He has built a roster with emerging stars who may stick around, and said fans had started to identify with Perez, Billy Butler, Alex Gordon, Eric Hosmer and others.        
“To me, that’s huge as we grow our organization — you grow new fans,” Moore said. “One of the frustrating things with this fan base, simply, is this: You have parents and grandparents who grew up loving the Royals because they always won. And then they had kids and grandkids, and they grew up liking the Red Sox and the Yankees and the Phillies and the Braves because those are the teams that were winning.        
“It created frustration in the community, and Kansas City is a very proud community. A lot of people come back here to live; it’s a nice quality of life. People want to be able to root for the Royals.”        
Finally, they have a compelling reason. The Royals have come alive since the All-Star break, with a 36-23 record through Tuesday that was a game behind Detroit for the best in the American League.        
The right to play important games in mid-September has validated the latest rebuilding effort. Several attempts failed before Moore arrived, and his has taken seven years to blossom. Many of the players have come through the farm system together, striving for games like these.        
“It’s pretty cool seeing the front office, your minor league directors and farm directors, come in and watch the games when we’re still in it and still have a chance in September,” said Hosmer, a first baseman hitting .302. “We know all the work we’ve done to get to this point, and this is the final project up here. We’ve got a lot of guys that have put together some good seasons, and we’re heading in the right direction.”        
The Royals may run out of time in their playoff push; the field is crowded, and just 11 games remain. But if they make it, the Royals could be tough to knock out. They would have momentum, and they do a few things very well.        
The Royals are a team of extremes. They rank first in the league in stolen bases and their hitters have the fewest strikeouts — but also the fewest home runs. Their pitching staff has the best earned run average in the league, at 3.50, and a sturdy, rebuilt rotation has kept the bullpen rested and dominant.        
The Royals’ bullpen E.R.A. is 2.60, the best in the league, although the relievers wasted a strong major league debut by the hard-throwing Yordano Ventura on Tuesday, squandering a 3-1 lead in the Indians’ 5-3 victory.        
“They’re a good bullpen — every last one of their dudes throw hard,” said the Indians’ Michael Bourn, who homered and tripled. “You’ve got to be ready and try to do what you can against them. That doesn’t happen often against them, but we were able to get them tonight.”

MANILA — Rebels fighting government forces in Zamboanga City, in the southern Philippines, briefly held its police chief on Tuesday, officials said.        


A rebel spokesman told local reporters that the police chief, Jose Chiquito Malayo, was a “prisoner of war.” But to the surprise of senior government officials, he emerged a few hours later with 23 rebels who had agreed to surrender.        
Chief Malayo entered an area held by the Moro National Liberation Front on Tuesday morning to try to negotiate a surrender by the insurgents and was held for several hours, the police said.        
At a late afternoon news briefing, officials in Zamboanga City, which is about 530 miles south of Manila, reported progress against the rebels, who have been holding five seaside neighborhoods.        
The fighting began on Sept. 9 when several hundred armed men, wearing uniforms of the Moro National Liberation Front, landed by boat in the city and tried to march to City Hall, raise their flag and declare independence from the national government, the police said.        
The group’s spokesman has said the rebels planned a peaceful march but were attacked by the military. The rebels retreated to several seaside neighborhoods and took as many as 180 hostages, the police said.        
The military and the Philippine National Police surrounded the rebels and have exchanged mortar fire, fired rockets from helicopters and battled street by street to retake the occupied neighborhoods. More than 90 police officers, soldiers, civilians and rebels have been killed in the eight days of fighting.        
A military spokesman, Lt. Col. Ramon Zagala, said on Tuesday that about 116 hostages had been released or rescued in the previous 24 hours. At least 82,000 people have been evacuated or displaced since the fighting began, officials said.        
Zamboanga City, a prosperous trading town of 800,000, has ground to a halt in the past week, with all flights canceled, schools and many businesses closed, and a curfew in effect from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. Ships have been warned to keep away from the port, which usually handles about 2.4 million passengers and 1.7 million tons of cargo each year, according to the research group IHS.        
Civil aviation authorities said at Tuesday afternoon’s briefing that a limited number of commercial flights would be allowed to resume on Thursday. On Friday, an escort helicopter protecting the flight of President Benigno S. Aquino III was fired upon as he landed in the city, but aviation officials said Tuesday that flight paths were now safe from ground fire.        
Mr. Aquino and other senior officials have remained in Zamboanga City to oversee the response to the crisis.        
Before the fighting, Zamboanga was a vibrant economic center on the southwestern edge of the island of Mindanao, which includes some of the poorest areas in the Philippines. The city accounts for 85 percent of the Philippines’ sardine production, and six canneries have had to halt operations during the fighting, according to IHS.        
“If the violence in Zamboanga peninsula continues for a protracted period, or if the conflict widens, this could also seriously undermine Mindanao’s efforts to attract new investment into tourism, mining and agriculture,” said Rajiv Biswas, the chief Asia-Pacific economist at IHS.

JERUSALEM — Israeli forces fatally shot a Palestinian man they had been sent to arrest in a refugee camp early Tuesday, according to the Israeli military and relatives of the man.        


The shooting, in the Jenin camp in the northern West Bank, was the latest in a series of deadly raids that have strained the atmosphere around nascent Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.        
The Israeli military said that the man, Islam Husam al-Toubasi, 21, was a “wanted terror activist” and that he was shot as he tried to flee and Palestinians hurled rocks, firebombs and improvised grenades at Israeli soldiers. Mr. Toubasi died later in an Israeli hospital.        
He was a member of Islamic Jihad, a militant group, according to his cousin Muhammad Rida Toubasi. The cousin said special Israeli units raided Mr. Toubasi’s house, where he had been sleeping on the roof; witnesses said that is where he was shot.        
“Now it is very tense, and people are very angry,” the cousin said by telephone.        
Other family members told the Palestinian news media that soldiers blew open the door of the house, went up to the roof and shot Mr. Toubasi in the foot before dragging him out of the house. They accused the army of deliberately killing him.        
The Palestinian news reports said several other Palestinians were injured by Israeli gunfire during the clashes, including a 13-year-old boy who was shot in the leg.        
The Israeli military account was different. It said its forces initially responded with riot dispersal tactics and only began firing toward the lower extremities of what it called the main instigators of the clashes “once rioters began shooting at the forces, upon feeling an imminent threat to their lives.”        
“The attack against the forces warranted a forceful response in self-defense,” Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a military spokesman, said in a statement, adding that the military would “review the circumstances of the shooting that led to the death of the terror suspect.”        
In August, Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinian men in similar circumstances, when the soldiers entered the Jenin camp to arrest another Islamic Jihad member and clashed with residents. A few days later, violent clashes broke out during another arrest raid in the Qalandiya refugee camp, between Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Ramallah; three Palestinian men were killed in that episode.        
The Qalandiya deaths disrupted the meetings of Israeli and Palestinian peace negotiators that were scheduled for that day.        
The two sides met on Monday, but Palestinian officials have complained that the talks, held in secrecy, have so far shown no progress.

Anyone who has read the warnings that come with new headphones knows that cranking music at full volume can permanently harm hearing. The 3M TEKK Protection WorkTunes headphones, however, are meant to protect your hearing, and not just from loud music.         
The black and safety-yellow ear cups are the giveaway that these workplace “earmuffs” are designed to protect hearing, reducing the high volume of chain saws, vacuum cleaners and other noisy power tools.        
Unlike common ear protectors, the $60 WorkTunes headset can also play music inside the ear cups while keeping excessive noise out.        
The headphones have a built-in AM/FM radio and they can connect to a music player using a wire with a 3.5mm jack. They use two AA batteries.        
Without any music playing, the headphones have serious 24-decibel noise reduction. The loudest trucks sounded like a whisper when I tested them while standing by a road. And when the music was playing, I couldn’t hear the trucks at all. The fit was very snug, but not uncomfortable.        
The radio has a robotic voice that says which frequency you are on, so you don’t need to see a dial and can scan for stations without taking the headphones off. There is also a button that switches to your favorite stations.        
When a jack is plugged in, the headphones automatically switch to play from the attached device.        
The sound quality is not exactly hi-fi, but it’s not bad. I also found that even the highest volume setting wasn’t that loud. No point in saving your ears from leaf blowers only to damage them with the White Stripes.

To the Editor: 
“Is Suburban Sprawl on Its Way Back?” (Sunday Review, Sept. 15) pointed out that one reason suburban sprawl may not resume its outward creep is that “moderate-income families have seen their transportation costs balloon to more than a quarter of their income.”        
I remember the many years in which I had a two-and-a-half-hour round-trip commute to my office job in northern New Jersey. It was awful, it cost hundreds of dollars a month and it was totally unnecessary. Today, I work at home in western Massachusetts, making a good living as a freelance writer. I regularly interview sources, confer with editors and do my work via phone and Internet. I travel on business no more than twice a year.        
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York was quoted in a recent magazine interview saying: “Being on a conference call isn’t the same as standing at the water cooler. It just isn’t. And I think you gotta go to work. And I think people should be next to each other to the extent possible.”        
To which I say, where’s the evidence that physical proximity to one another helps people work better or more creatively? And where’s the evidence that professionals are any less productive when they work at home?        
It’s time for more employers to take advantage of modern technology and allow telecommuting. Then people won’t have to choose between having a nice house in the suburbs with a long commute and living in an overpriced condo near or in a city. They will live better, spend more time with their children and be more productive when they don’t have a costly, stressful commute every day. And they can work just as closely with their colleagues as they can when they’re in the same office.

In an effort to introduce Norman Mailer’s work to a younger generation of readers, Random House is embarking on a publishing campaign that will include the release of a new essay collection, eight books in e-book format for the first time and repackaged paperbacks.         
Mr. Mailer, the larger-than-life writer who is perhaps best known for his novels “The Armies of the Night” and “The Executioner’s Song,” which were published in the 1960s and 1970s. He died in 2007.        
Gina Centrello, the president and publisher of Random House, said the publishing program will begin with a new book, “Mind of an Outlaw,” a selection of essays by Mr. Mailer, with an introduction by Jonathan Lethem.        
“Norman was an American original both on the page and in life,” Ms. Centrello said in an e-mail. “Random House and his readers miss him tremendously. It’s wonderful to have this opportunity to relaunch these books for a new generation.” The rerelease of Mr. Mailer’s backlist books will continue until 2016.

Toy cameras aren’t just for children There is a thriving art movement built on the out-of-focus, distorted, inaccurately colored photos that come from toy cameras.        


Nevertheless, your first reaction to the Bonzart Lit digital camera, which measures less than 3 inches by 2 inches, and is only half an inch thick, will probably be along the lines of, “How cute!”        
But the tiny toy can take some very artistic photographs.        
For one thing, it has a fuller menu of options than you’d expect from a camera this size. Resolution can be set at up to 2,048 by 1,536 pixels — the same resolution as an Apple iPad 3 Retina screen. You can also set light metering to measure the center of the picture, the whole scene or a small spot in the middle, just as you would on serious digital single-lens reflex cameras. And you can even set white balance for daylight, cloudy conditions, fluorescent or tungsten light.        
You can also adjust exposure, and the camera has a rudimentary filter menu, which can make your photos color, black and white, sepia or negative — or even in tints of red, green or blue.        
That leaves a lot of room for creativity, but it would be a mistake to call the camera sophisticated. It essentially has a pinhole lens, fixed focus and a very slow shutter speed. That means that lots of your photos are going to be a little soft (although it does have a screw mount for a tripod, to help steady the camera). The color is quite muted. And you get a natural vignette effect, a kind of darkening around the edges that draws your eye to the center.        
But it is those limitations that can make the images compelling.        
Offered in red, black, blue, white and pink, the camera is available online for $40. But you will also need a microSD memory card, which is not included. A 2GB card can be found online for less than $10. ROY FURCHGOTT

CHICAGO — It is hard to dream up a more auspicious series of events for Pat Quinn, Illinois’s governor, whose re-election hopes had appeared shaky enough that a line of fellow Democrats had been salivating over his job for ages.        


In July, Lisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general and daughter of the powerful longtime State House speaker, said that she had decided against running for governor, citing her father’s role as a reason. In August, Kwame Raoul, who replaced Barack Obama in this state’s Senate, said he had decided against it too. And on Tuesday, William M. Daley, a member of one of Chicago’s most influential Democratic families who said just months ago that he was running for governor, announced that he had changed his mind.        
“I’ve lost sleep, to be frank with you, and been struggling over the last couple of weeks as to whether or not what’s needed I can provide over a long period,” Mr. Daley, who has been deeply critical of Mr. Quinn and the state’s miserable financial circumstances, said in a sometimes emotional news conference here. “It’s not about a campaign of six months or 14 months. It really is about a minimum of five to nine years to begin to straighten out this state.”        
“The voters of Illinois deserve someone who’s going to commit not just to a tough campaign but to the more difficult job of governing this state, a state which deserves better,” said Mr. Daley, alluding, in part, to Illinois’s vastly underfinanced pension system. “As I’ve surveyed both the rigors of this campaign and the enormity of the challenges of fixing these problems, I’ve concluded that I cannot commit to what the voters may need.”        
The abrupt choice from a veteran of the state’s political world was a remarkable turn of fortune for Mr. Quinn, sweeping out, at least for now, well-known opponents from a Democratic primary next March.        
Some political experts here pointed to the latest development as only Mr. Quinn’s most recent stroke of luck, noting that Mr. Quinn, who was once seen more as a well-meaning gadfly than a political heavyweight, had ascended to governor in the first place because Rod R. Blagojevich, who was in his second term as governor, was arrested on corruption charges in 2008. Mr. Quinn was the lieutenant governor at the time.        
Still, Mr. Quinn’s fortunes will be tested in 2014. Four well-known Republican candidates have lined up to run for governor, including Bill Brady, a state senator whom Mr. Quinn defeated in a close election in 2010. Democrats control the governor’s office and both chambers of the State Legislature, but Republicans have won statewide office here in years past, largely with some combination of conservative fiscal views and moderate social ones. Others in the Republican field who want Mr. Quinn’s job: Dan Rutherford, the state treasurer; Bruce Rauner, a wealthy business executive; and Kirk Dillard, a state senator who ran for governor in 2010.        
“But in that, there’s another lucky break for Quinn,” said Dick Simpson, a political scientist and former Chicago City Council member. “The Republicans will have a primary to go through, and whoever comes out is likely to be tarnished.”        
Perhaps Mr. Quinn’s biggest challenge is in Springfield, the state capital, where lawmakers have argued over how best to repair the state’s pension system and its growing shortfall, now estimated at about $100 billion. Tensions over the impasse bubbled over when Mr. Quinn said he was withholding lawmakers’ paychecks until they fixed the pension system, and lawmakers sued him, in a case expected to be heard in court on Wednesday.        
As Mr. Daley — the son of one former Chicago mayor and the brother of another, as well as a former White House chief of staff to President Obama and commerce secretary under President Bill Clinton — departed the race, he said he planned to return to the private sector. He said he would return campaign contributions. And he pointedly did not endorse Mr. Quinn.        
He said he still believed he could have beaten Mr. Quinn. But the state’s challenges after the election appeared more daunting. “It’s going to take a governor quite a while to help this state dig out of the mess which it is in,” Mr. Daley said.

BEIJING — If you want to Lean In in Chinese, you “Take One Step Forward.” That’s how the title of Sheryl Sandberg’s contemporary feminist manifesto, “Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead,” has been translated here.        


And you do it with gusto, judging from the reactions of about a thousand students and businesspeople at two events in Beijing last week where Ms. Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, promoted the new Chinese version of her book.        
“People were hungry for it,” Allison Ye, co-founder of a “Lean In circle” in Beijing — a small group of peers who meet to talk about the book’s message — said of the response to Ms. Sandberg’s main point: overcome your internal barriers to success and get to the deal table.        
The enthusiasm suggests an intriguing possibility: As the Chinese government strikes anew against freedom of speech, detaining even mild-mannered democracy activists, civil society advocates and popular public opinion leaders, might there be a feminist revolution in China before there is a democratic one?        
In recent weeks, Lean In circles have set up in half a dozen universities in the capital, including Tsinghua University, Peking University and the Communication University of China, members said in interviews.        
“I feel like this is a new stage for us,” said Ms. Ye, 27, who works for a Chinese company. “I can’t speak for everyone, but I feel that despite the cultural differences between America and China, the method is universal. I feel it’s true that you can take responsibility for yourself, it’s a good thing, and then you can change your situation.”        
Of course, feminism in China predates Ms. Sandberg’s book. But it has gained new focus with the arrival of the movement here. Ms. Ye’s conversion began in March, when she chanced online upon a TED talk given by Ms. Sandberg in 2010 called “Why we have too few women leaders.” She was hooked.        
“I was shaken,” she said. “I said to myself, ‘Who is she?’ Everything she said was, wow! So true. I watched it three times in one day. Then I bought an English copy of her book.        
“With a friend, we said, ‘Why don’t we open a Lean In circle? We want to support Chinese women and help them set up their own circles.”’        
Word spread, including to 21-year-old Carrie Huang. Two weeks ago, Ms. Huang set up a circle at the prestigious Renmin University of China, where she studies finance. “My friends and I, we all felt that we do that — we underestimate ourselves,” she said in an interview. “It has to do with our education and background. Our parents tell us, ‘You are girls, get yourself a stable life and don’t have too much ambition.”’        
Many young Chinese women, especially in cities, are highly educated and beginning to overtake men in some college subjects — Ms. Huang said there were 16 women and 7 men in her finance class — but deep cultural messages hold them back.        
“We fear we aren’t good enough. We lack confidence,” Ms. Huang said, adding that many women in China prioritize their boyfriends’ or husbands’ goals. “What we need is the courage to try different things,” she said. “It’s about discovering what you want to do. Parents have wishes for us, and it’s hard to change.”        
At their weekly meetings, Ms. Huang said, she and her half-dozen “circlers,” some of whom are male, plan to raise specific questions. “We want to talk about ‘strong women’ and how men see them — as aggressive or bossy?”        
Not everyone likes the Chinese translation of the book’s impactful English title. Some snickered that it was similar to the message found in men’s public urinals to “please take a step forward.”        
Ms. Huang says it doesn’t quite catch the psychological nature of Ms. Sandberg’s message. “It makes it sound like it’s about overcoming external obstacles, taking a step forward,” she said. “But actually, this book is about overcoming your inner obstacles.”        
Either way, experienced Chinese feminists have welcomed it.        
“I think her message is definitely an empowering one, calling for more women to get to the deal table,” said Feng Yuan, an activist for gender rights and equality.        
Still, it is only one response to the daunting cultural and institutional hurdles facing women in China, Ms. Feng said.        
“I don’t think the personal approach can change the fundamentally unequal gender structures,” she said. “But in terms of a woman’s individual situation, it’s useful because a lot of women fear feminism, that kind of collective call. A personal message is workable.”        
It may not work for uneducated, poor or rural women, Ms. Feng said, an echo of criticism that the book has received in the West. “Her target audience is educated and ambitious women, and these women are able to mobilize resources to achieve their goals,” she said.        
“But we shouldn’t be too critical,” she said. “You can’t expect her to have a formula for all women’s rights. Even the very well educated need this, and they should have it.”        
Ms. Huang and Ms. Ye say China is ready for “Lean In,” regardless of the tight political atmosphere.        
“I think everything we do in the Lean In circle is positive,” Ms. Huang said. “We’re not in violation of anything, so we should be O.K.”        
Ms. Ye said: “I’ve thought about it because I’m very careful. I think if the government allowed Sheryl Sandberg to promote her book, then the government supports the content of her book.” Adding some irony to the situation, Facebook is barred from China’s censored Internet.        
“A lot of what she says fits with the Chinese government’s message,” Ms. Ye said. “I think as long as we stay within a circle, it’s not threatening at all.”

The Obama administration announced on Tuesday that it was extending minimum wage and overtime protections to the nation’s nearly two million home care workers.         
Advocates for low-wage workers have pushed for this change, asserting that home care workers, who care for elderly and disabled Americans, were wrongly classified into the same “companionship services” category as baby sitters — a group that is exempt from minimum wage and overtime coverage. Under the new rule, home care aides, unlike baby sitters, would be covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the nation’s main wage and hour law.        
In an unusual move, the administration said the new regulation would not take effect until Jan. 1, 2015, even though regulations often take effect 60 days after being issued. The delay until 2015 is to give families that use these attendants, as well as state Medicaid programs, time to prepare.        
Industry experts say most of these workers are already paid at least the minimum wage, but many do not receive a time-and-a-half overtime premium when they work more than 40 hours a week. About 20 states exclude home care workers from their wage and hour laws.        
“We think the workers providing this critical work should be receiving the same basic protection and coverage as the vast majority of American workers,” said Laura Fortman, deputy administrator of the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division. “We’ve seen a lot of turnover in this industry, and we believe that this new rule will stabilize the work force.”        
The nation’s home care workers usually earn $8.50 to $12 an hour, according to industry officials. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.        
According to the Obama administration, almost 40 percent of aides receive government benefits like food stamps and Medicaid. Ninety-two percent of these workers are female, almost 30 percent are black and 12 percent are Hispanic.        
Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez said in a statement, “Today we are taking an important step toward guaranteeing that these professionals receive the wage protections they deserve while protecting the right of individuals to live at home.”        
But industry officials said the changes would cause increases in Medicaid and Medicare spending, raise costs for families that use such services, and result in fewer jobs for home care workers.        
Andrea L. Devoti, chairman of the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, said the new rule “will mean that people will receive less care.” She said the higher costs resulting from the new rule would lead many people to hire home care aides part time rather than full time. “Caregivers will in the end receive less pay,” she said.        
The newly issued rule was also criticized by Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the House Education and the Work Force Committee, and Representative Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican who heads the panel’s subcommittee on work force protections.        
They said it not only would raise costs, but would “limit access to in-home care for vulnerable Americans.” They added, “Faced with higher costs, some individuals will have no choice but to leave their homes and enter institutional living.” Long-term nursing home care, much of which is paid by Medicaid, is generally more expensive than home care.        
Ms. Fortman of the administration’s wage and hour division said 15 states now provided overtime and minimum wage protection to home care aides. “We have not seen any evidence that it has resulted in job loss or any serious negative impact for the workers or for the people using the services,” she said.        
The administration announced the change 21 months after first proposing the rule and after having received 26,000 public comments, many of them from for-profit home care agencies that opposed it. Many labor advocates criticized the administration for taking so long to issue its final rule, but Labor Department officials said reviewing the comments and holding related public meetings took time.        
The federal government says six million of the 40 million Americans older than 65 need some form of daily assistance to live outside a nursing home. Federal officials estimate that the number will double to 12 million by 2030.        
Under the new rule, any home care aides hired through home care companies or other third-party agencies cannot be exempt from minimum wage and overtime coverage. The exemptions for aides who mainly provide “companionship services” — defined as fellowship and protection for an elderly person or person with an illness, injury or disability who requires assistance — are limited to the individual, family or household using the services.        
If an aide or companion provides “care” that exceeds 20 percent of the total hours she works each week, then the worker is to receive minimum wage and overtime protections.        
The new rule defines care as assisting with the activities of daily living, like dressing, grooming, feeding or bathing, and assisting with “instrumental activities of daily living,” like meal preparation, driving, light housework, managing finances and assisting with the physical taking of medications.        
The companionship exemption will not apply if the aide or companion provides medically related services that are typically performed by trained personnel, like nurses or certified nursing assistants.        
Live-in domestic service workers who reside in the employer’s home and are employed by an individual, family or household are exempt from overtime pay, although they must be paid at least the federal minimum wage for all hours worked.

WASHINGTON — As the White House and Congress careen toward another fiscal showdown, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warned on Tuesday that President Obama and lawmakers have been cutting the wrong kind of federal spending as they try to avoid the unsustainable buildup of debt that is projected in the coming decades.        


Annual federal deficits will continue to fall in the short term, the budget office reported in its yearly long-term outlook, because of the recent spending cuts in military and domestic programs and rising tax collections in a recovering economy. The report projected the deficit in 2015 to be equal to 2.1 percent of the economy’s output, or just one-fifth of the peak shortfall at the height of the recession in 2009.        
But starting in 2016, deficits are projected to rise again as more baby boomers begin drawing from Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security — the fast-growing entitlement programs, which Democrats and Republicans cannot agree on how to rein in.        
The accumulating federal debt, which averaged 38 percent of the gross domestic product for the 40 years before the 2008 financial crisis, would rise from 73 percent of the G.D.P. now — above what most economists consider an optimum level — to at least 100 percent in 2038.        
Budget experts have been warning since at least the Reagan era that in the early 21st century, aging baby boomers will drive entitlement spending — chiefly for Medicare and Medicaid, and to a lesser degree for Social Security — to levels that will crowd out all other military and domestic spending. Interest on the debt will also be a major and growing expense.        
What is different now is that the Republican-controlled House and the White House have been on a two-year run of deficit reduction that has resulted, because of their inability to agree on entitlement reductions and higher tax revenues, in deepening cuts in the budget areas that are not responsible for the projections of mounting debt. Those discretionary spending programs — which include things as varied as Pentagon weapons purchases, air traffic control, science and research, education and national parks — are being squeezed even as entitlement spending grows automatically.        
The budget office said that by 2023, the annual deficit would rise to an estimated 3.5 percent of the G.D.P., which is just beyond the level that many economists consider sustainable in a growing economy. By 2038, it would be 6.5 percent.        
Under a nine-year plan starting in the 2011 fiscal year, discretionary spending was already being reduced annually. But the across-the-board “sequester” that took effect in March, when Republicans and Mr. Obama could not agree on alternative deficit reductions, has pared domestic and military programs further, resulting in increasing layoffs, furloughs and service cutbacks.        
Republicans have supported keeping the sequestration cuts in place rather than accepting Mr. Obama’s proposal for a mix of higher taxes on wealthy people and some corporations and cuts in future entitlement spending. And he has said he will not accept their alternative for deeper reductions in Medicare and Medicaid without tax increases.        
Federal spending for the major health programs and Social Security will equal 14 percent of the G.D.P. in 25 years, double the level of the last four decades, the budget office projected. While federal revenues are projected to grow — to 19.5 percent of the G.D.P. by 2038, compared with the 40-year average of 17.5 percent — that rise is not enough to offset the spending for federal benefit programs.        
In contrast with entitlement spending, discretionary spending for domestic and military programs by 2023 would fall to 5.3 percent of the G.D.P., from the 7.3 percent of this year — the lowest levels in about 70 years.        
“Unless substantial changes are made to the major health care programs and Social Security,” the report said, “those programs will absorb a much larger share of the economy’s total output in the future than they have in the past.”

CHICAGO — After a drought in new construction dating back to the 2008 financial crisis, downtown Chicago is suddenly awash in new hotel projects.        


No fewer than a dozen new hotels representing about 2,700 rooms have recently opened or are under construction, and additional projects seem to be announced on a weekly basis.        
These include four- and five-star properties by international names like Langham and Loews, as well as numerous smaller lifestyle hotels by a range of independent operators. The boom, say developers and analysts, is driven by strengthening fundamentals of the market.        
Adam McGaughy, managing director of the Midwest hotel business of Jones Lang LaSalle, a large real estate services firm here, said, “The city exceeded its 2007 occupancy peak of 74.4 percent last year and there’s lots of room for average daily rate growth. When that happens, new supply starts to become part of the conversation.”        
Chicago is the country’s fourth-largest hotel market behind Las Vegas, New York and Orlando, Fla., with a downtown total of about 37,000 rooms. In the past, the industry has depended on the city’s lakefront McCormick Place convention complex to spur growth.        
What makes this boom different is that it is being driven largely by smaller lifestyle hotels that appeal to leisure and international travelers.        
Ben Weprin, president of locally based A. J. Capital Partners, who has three such projects under construction, said: “Conventions are not our primary focus. We aim for a younger demographic that likes to go out to restaurants and bars. We try to create a town square atmosphere in our properties.”        
According to TR Mandigo & Company, a hotel consulting firm here, leisure travel now accounts for about 15 percent of the downtown hotel market. That is an increase from 10 percent in the early 2000s, and further increases are anticipated because of an aggressive city marketing program instituted by Mayor Rahm Emanuel.        
“The mayor has made tourism a priority,” said Donald Welsh, chief executive of Choose Chicago, the city’s tourism and convention bureau. Over the last 18 months, he added, the city has opened 10 international tourism offices in countries like China, Japan, Brazil and Britain, and it is also running 30-second television ads promoting Chicago as a vacation destination in cities throughout the Midwest.        
Many of the new hotels are in areas that, until recently, were not considered tourist zones, the most notable of which is a five-block stretch of Michigan Avenue just south of the Chicago River where four new projects are under way.        
John Rutledge, chief executive of locally based Oxford Capital Partners and a leading downtown hotel developer, pointed to the attractive features of the neighborhood that lend themselves to hotels. For one, he said, old classic buildings there can be adapted to intimate hotel spaces. Another asset is its proximity to popular areas, like the Loop business district, Millennium Park, Navy Pier and the North Michigan Avenue shopping district.        
Mr. Rutledge recently paid $53 million for the London Guarantee Building, a lavishly ornamented 1920s-era office building at the northern end of the district, where he plans to build a hotel with more than 400 rooms. He expects to begin construction early next year, and to be finished in fall of 2015.        
Mr. Weprin of A. J. Capital also has a project in this area, a 250-room hotel carved out of the landmark Chicago Athletic Association Building on Michigan Avenue across from Millennium Park. His partner for the project is John Pritzker, founder and director of Geolo Capital, a San Francisco investment firm that specializes in hospitality and entertainment projects. Mr. Pritzker, who grew up in Chicago, is the son of the late Jay Pritzker, founder of the Hyatt hotel chain.        
The Chicago Athletic Association dates from 1893 and was designed by Henry Ives Cobb, a leading 19th-century architect here. The building has a Venetian gothic facade and an extravagant interior of cast iron staircases, vaulted ceilings, elaborate tile floors and 15 working fireplaces.        
“People get an amazed look on their faces when they go into that building,” Mr. Pritzker said. “They can’t believe something like that still exists.”        
The hotel, which will have 250 rooms and be operated by Geolo Capital’s Commune Hotels and Resorts division, will cost $125 million and be finished in late 2014. It has not been named yet.        
Mr. Weprin’s other notable project is a new $50 million Soho House in the west Loop meatpacking district, another emerging neighborhood known primarily for its restaurants and night life. His partners are Nick Jones, founder of the London-based Soho House, and Shapack Development of Chicago.        
The hotel, which will open next spring, occupies an old industrial building on Green Street and will have about 40 rooms plus extensive restaurant, bar and spa facilities.        
“We’ve been looking for the right site in Chicago for quite a few years,” said Mr. Jones. The meatpacking district, he added, is “buzzy and interesting and lots of new things” are opening there.        
Not that Chicago is turning its back on the convention business or large convention hotels. A new 316-room Langham Hotel on the north bank of the Chicago River and a new 460-room annex to the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place have recently been completed.        
Next up in this category is a Loews Hotel, which will occupy the lower floors of a 52-story residential building under construction on the north bank of the Chicago River several blocks from Navy Pier. The developer is the DRW Trading Group of Chicago.        
The hotel to be owned by Leows will consist of about 400 rooms plus 25,000 square feet of meeting space. It will open in 2015. The hotel is costing about $400,000 a room, or about $160 million.        
Jonathan Tisch, chairman of Loews, said, “Chicago continues to be a city that event organizers look to and — since we typically do about 50 percent group business — that should benefit us.”

JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Tuesday that he would focus on halting Iran’s nuclear program in a meeting with President Obama in Washington at the end of the month and in his annual speech before the United Nations General Assembly, using the Syria situation to increase pressure for a “credible military threat.”        


Repeating a four-step formula he has been urging for months, Mr. Netanyahu told his cabinet that Iran must stop enriching uranium, remove enriched uranium from the country, close its nuclear plant near Qum and stop what he called “the plutonium track.”        
“Until all four of these measures are achieved, the pressure on Iran must be increased and not relaxed, and certainly not eased,” the prime minister said in a statement released by his office.        
Mr. Netanyahu, who is scheduled to meet with Mr. Obama on Sept. 30, said recent developments regarding Syria’s chemical weapons had “confirmed the assumptions” that guided Israel’s policy.        
“A recalcitrant state that develops or acquires weapons of mass destruction is certainly likely to use them,” he said. “Only a credible military threat can allow diplomacy or other steps to effect a halt to this armament process.”        
Separately, Israel’s minister of strategic affairs expressed skepticism on Tuesday about reports that Iran might be willing to close the Fordo nuclear reactor near Qum.        
“We don’t care about talk, we care about actions,” the minister, Yuval Steinitz, said on Israel Radio. “The centrifuges are spinning.”        
Though the closing was one of Mr. Netanyahu’s four demands, Mr. Steinitz called it “a small step that on its own is almost meaningless” because Iran has other plants, suggesting that it would simply reduce Tehran’s capacity to produce “seven nuclear bombs a year” to six.        
“Iran has to be made to face the following dilemma: Do you want to save your economy? Give up the nuclear program,” Mr. Steinitz said. “If you continue with your nuclear program, you will cause the collapse of the Iranian economy and will bring about the very realistic possibility of a military strike to destroy your nuclear facilities.”

Jesmyn Ward, who won a National Book Award in 2011 for her novel “Salvage the Bones,” grew up in rural Mississippi, mostly in a series of single-wide trailers. Her mother was a maid; the family was on food stamps. Her father raised pit bulls he bred for fighting. He trained them with deflated bike tires.        


One of his dogs was named Homeboy. Another was Chief. Another was Mr. Cool. One day Homeboy attacked the young Ms. Ward, sending her to the hospital with severe puncture wounds and gashes and an earlobe nearly ripped off.        
“My father said that if I had not fought, I would have died,” she writes in “Men We Reaped,” her jagged and emotionally flattening new memoir. “He said the dog had been trying to rip out my throat.”        
Years later, the author observes: “Now, the long scar in my head feels like a thin plastic cocktail straw, and like all war wounds, it itches.”        
“Men We Reaped” is a book about scars. The title comes from Harriet Tubman. (“We heard the rain falling and that was the blood falling; and when we came to get in the crops, it was dead men that we reaped.”) Ms. Ward’s subject is what it’s like to be a black man in the modern American South.        
Her memoir is, ostensibly, about the lives of five young men she knew well, including her own brother, each of whom died young. One was a suicide; the others were lost to drugs or accidents. Ms. Ward could be speaking about all of them when she writes of one, “He wanted more for himself, but he didn’t know how to get it.”        
Yet, to its credit, this book isn’t easy to define. Its most vivid character is probably the author’s father, whom she loves yet soberly observes. He was a gang member when he lived briefly in Oakland, Calif.; his enthusiasms are kung fu movies, weight lifting and his motorcycle. “He listened to Public Enemy,” the author writes, “and only Public Enemy.”        
He left Ms. Ward’s family and had children with other women. “Remaining faithful to my mother required a kind of moral discipline he’d never developed,” she writes, “since it was constantly undermined by his natural gifts: his charm, his sense of humor, his uncommon beauty.”        
So much happens in this relatively short book, there are so many shrewd details, that it could have simply been a straightforward memoir of Ms. Ward’s life. She was born three months premature, when her mother was 18, and her father 20.        
She had blood tumors, underwent operations and was lucky to survive. “He could not put his pointer finger in my palm for me to grab,” she says about her father, “since his finger was the size of my arm.”        
Ms. Ward is eloquent about her gradual escape from the world she was born into, about how she was the only black girl in a private school, her tuition paid by one of her mother’s employers. She felt “skinny and ugly” and bullied. She was forced to watch her mother clean her classmates’ houses.        
Ms. Ward, who graduated from Stanford University, writes about her time in college: “I would encounter W. E. B. Du Bois and the term double consciousness. When I read it, I thought about sitting in my mother’s employer’s family room, watching my mother clean while I waited for her to finish so we could go home.”        
This at times somber book is also shot through with life, with a sense of rural community and what it felt like to be adolescent and footloose on hot Mississippi nights, all the beer cans and weed and loud music and easy sex and rolled-down car windows.        
“The drinking had been insane, ecstatic,” Ms. Ward writes. “We’d taken shots of Everclear that summer, felt that liquor running through us, thrumming: for this moment, you are young and alive.” This feeling slowly vanishes with the deaths that surround her. “Now, we were subdued drinkers, drinking to forget.”        
“Men We Reaped” loops around, again and again, to Ms. Ward’s observations about race and masculinity in the South, about men “pinioned beneath poverty and history and racism.” She writes about the cops who circle black neighborhoods like vultures, the illegal strip searches in middle schools, the minimum-wage jobs that offer no way out.        
Little wonder so many turned to drugs. About cocaine use, she writes, “I’d seen some of what grown-ups who were poor and felt cornered and at their wit’s end did to feel less like themselves.”        
About infidelity, and about so many black children being raised without fathers, Ms. Ward wonders if men like her father were “searching for a sense of freedom or a sense of power that being a black man in the South denied them.” She adds, “They were devalued everywhere except in the home, and this is the place where they turned the paradigm on its head and devalued those in their thrall.”        
Ms. Ward occasionally presses her thumb down too hard on this material, forcing meanings that were plain already, but these lapses are rare. Some of the elements here will be familiar to those who read “Salvage the Bones,” a book that was filled, for example, with indelible dogfighting scenes.        
“Men We Reaped” reaffirms Ms. Ward’s substantial talent. It’s an elegiac book that’s rangy at the same time. She thinks back about her brother, and about her old dead friends, and about their nighttime adventures in cars. Then she declares, “I don’t ride with anyone like that anymore.”

As noted elsewhere in the review, it is “Men We Reaped,”  not “Men We Reap.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 21, 2013The Books of The Times review on Wednesday about “Men We Reaped,” by Jesmyn Ward, referred incompletely to her educational history in noting that she writes about her time in college.

PARIS — The Dutch defense ministry said on Tuesday that it had selected the F-35 fighter jet from Lockheed Martin to replace its aging fleet of F-16s, bringing an end to years of uncertainty over the Netherlands’ commitment to a program that has been plagued by technical delays and mounting development costs.        


Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the Dutch defense minister, proposed to Parliament the purchase of 37 F-35s — far fewer than the 85 planes initially envisioned before the financial crisis put a squeeze on military budgets across the region.        
The plan sets a budget of 4.5 billion euros, or $6 billion, for the aircraft and a further 270 million euros a year for maintenance and operating costs — equivalent to the annual operating costs of the current F-16 fleet. It also builds in a “contingency reserve” of 10 percent to account for any unforeseen rise in the final cost.        
Deliveries of the first planes are expected to begin in 2019 and be completed by 2023, when the F-16 fleet will be discontinued.        
“The cutbacks in defense budgets which many NATO member states, including the Netherlands, are facing demand careful consideration and astute choice,” the defense ministry said in a statement. “Above all, opting for a modest number of the best aircraft attests to a sense of reality.”        
The proposed order will be put to a parliamentary vote this year, said Sascha Louwhoff, a defense ministry spokeswoman. Approval is likely, she said, given that the proposal has the support of the governing coalition of the conservative V.V.D. and Labor parties, which took power a year ago.        
The Netherlands is one of nine countries that joined to help develop the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, securing lucrative subcontracting deals for local companies from Lockheed Martin. Most of those partners have stuck with the program despite the cost overruns that have put the plane more than 70 percent over budget.        
But opposition to the escalating costs prompted some politicians in the Netherlands and other industrial partner countries, like Denmark and Canada, to urge that the program be opened to competitive bids from other manufacturers, including Boeing, Saab of Sweden and Eurofighter, a European consortium led by European Aeronautic Defense and Space.        
“This could have gone either way,” Richard L. Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said of the Dutch decision. “Politics might have driven them to an open competition. The fact that they are staying in the fold is a boost for the program.”        
After parliamentary approval, the Netherlands would become the seventh export customer for the F-35, after Australia, Britain, Israel, Italy, Japan and Norway. The American military is by far the largest customer for the F-35, with more than 2,400 planes of the three different models on order at an estimated cost of $392 billion.        
In a statement, Lockheed Martin said it welcomed the Dutch decision, calling it “testimony to the Netherlands’ confidence in the program,” and said the order would help secure high-technology jobs over the long term with Dutch companies involved in the plane’s design and manufacture.

WASHINGTON — For the second year in a row, the proportion of Americans without health insurance declined in 2012, even though real household income and the poverty rate were not significantly different from their 2011 levels, the Census Bureau reported on Tuesday.        


In 2012, the bureau said, 15.4 percent of people were uninsured, down from 15.7 percent in 2011. The number of uninsured people, 48 million, was not statistically different from the estimate of 48.6 million in 2011.        
David S. Johnson, the chief of social and economic statistics at the bureau, said that much of the increase in coverage last year was attributable to government programs. Medicare covered 15.7 percent of the population, compared with 15.2 percent the previous year.        
Census Bureau data showed significant changes in coverage over the last 13 years.        
From 1999 to 2012, the bureau said, the proportion of people with private health insurance declined to 63.9 percent, from 73 percent, while the proportion with government coverage rose to 32.6 percent, from 24.2 percent.        
One of the most popular provisions of the 2010 health care law allows young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance policies until age 26. That provision appears to be having its intended effect.        
Among people ages 19 to 25, the proportion who were uninsured declined to 27.2 percent in 2012. Though the bureau said that figure was not significantly different from the 2011 rate, it was down from 29.8 percent two years earlier.        
The proportion of children younger than 19 without health insurance declined last year, to 9.2 percent, from 9.7 percent in 2011.        
Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said the census figures showed that President Obama’s policies were “making progress in expanding access to affordable health care.” Mr. Jennings said the progress would accelerate in coming months as millions of Americas gain access to coverage under the 2010 health care law.        
Mr. Jennings said the data tended to disprove Republican predictions that the new law would undermine employer-sponsored coverage. The bureau reported that the proportion of people with employment-based coverage — 54.9 percent in 2012 — was “not statistically different” from the share in 2011.        
Noting that children were much more likely than adults to have insurance, Mr. Jennings said this reflected “more than two decades of bipartisan effort to expand access” to coverage through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.        
The proportion of Hispanics who were uninsured last year declined by a percentage point, to 29.1 percent. But it was still much higher than the comparable rates for blacks (19 percent), Asian-Americans (15.1 percent) and non-Hispanic whites (11.1 percent).        
The Census Bureau also reported these findings:        
¶The proportion of the foreign-born population without health insurance in 2012 was about two and a half times that of the native-born population — 32 percent, as against 13 percent.        
¶Two of the nation’s four major regions, the South and the West, accounted for 61 percent of the nation’s population, but 71 percent of all the uninsured.        
¶The uninsured rate was higher among people with lower incomes and lower among those with higher incomes. For example, 24.9 percent of people in households with annual incomes of less than $25,000 had no health insurance coverage last year. Among people in households with incomes of $75,000 or more, the comparable figure was 7.9 percent.

LONDON — Sophie Hulme’s new muse is the frog. For spring/summer 2014, the British handbag designer was inspired by the plastic jumping frogs found in Christmas crackers, and the dazzling colors and patterns of deadly frogs native to the rain forests.        


That might not sound like the beginning of a collection from a serious fashion business, but Ms. Hulme’s handbags, with their quirky charms and staunchly anti-logo stance, have quickly gained an international following.        
Her label, introduced in January 2009, includes ready-to-wear, accessories and jewelry, but it is her handbags that she is best known for and that are seeing increased demand.        
In the last year, her full-time staff has grown from one person to 11, giving the London-born designer the capacity to make the leap from selling to niche boutiques to stocking international heavyweights like Selfridges, Harvey Nichols, Barneys, Saks, Lane Crawford, Tsum and Net-a-Porter.        
The bags themselves are minimalist but instantly recognizable by their distinctive gold-colored hardware and tongue-in-cheek brass charms. Designs have included a referee’s whistle, a bubble-blowing wand and a fish-and-chip fork.        
Ms. Hulme’s success lies in her ability to combine a “slick international aesthetic with an exaggerated British style,” said Sasha Sarokin, Net-A-Porter’s international accessories manager. The online retailer first stocked Ms. Hulme’s totes and shoulder bags in early 2012, and they have shown a “sharp and unfaltering upward swing in sales across all territories,” she said.        
“She is one of the first new handbag brands that I’ve seen to take a supremely sophisticated aesthetic and sell it at a price point that is jaw-droppingly low,” Ms. Sarokin continued.        
When the average designer handbag costs $1,500 or more, Ms. Hulme’s designs are $450 to $950, a range that reflects a considered business strategy.        
“I gave pricing a lot of thought,” she said. “I think there was a big gap where brands like Miu Miu and Mulberry used to sit.”        
She sources materials and hardware from Italy but produces the handbags in Hungary to keep prices down.        
“There is definitely a void for premium contemporary designer handbags that are high in design elements at a competitive price point,” said Irene Yu, divisional merchandise manager of footwear and handbags at Pedder Group, whose company stocks Ms. Hulme’s handbags at its stand-alone On Pedder accessories stores across Asia, as well as in the accessories departments that the company operates at Lane Crawford and Joyce.        
“British designers have a special talent in designing handbags that stand out but also feel like instant updated classics,” said Maria Dueñas Jacobs, accessories director of Elle magazine in the United States. “Designers such as Anya Hindmarch, Emma Hill and Charlotte Olympia have a special way of balancing luxury and charm without compromising on quality, and Sophie fits with this approach.”        
In 2012, Mulberry’s chief executive, Bruno Guillon, a former managing director at Hermès, oversaw a price increase of the brand’s existing handbag styles and the introduction of more bags priced at more than $1,500.        
While the Mulberry brand’s bag styles, like the Bayswater and Alexa, continue to be popular, the decision to shift away from affordable luxury clearly has made Mulberry’s products less accessible to the average consumer.        
Ms. Sarokin said that Ms. Hulme’s brand did not simply fill the gap left by Mulberry’s shift in strategy. “I think Sophie’s brand sits next to Mulberry rather than replaces it: She’s more edgy. The mum and daughter would both wear a Bayswater, but with Sophie, it’s more likely the daughter who’ll buy into the brand,” she said.        
Unlike Mulberry, Ms. Hulme has taken an understated approach to marketing, partly because of financial necessity and partly because tastes have changed. She has not staged runway shows because, she said, “I want people to buy my designs because the products are beautiful and timeless objects in their own right and not because they buy into a vision that only exists on the catwalk.”        
The “It bag” — a term coined in the 1990s, when logo dictated desirability — has been overtaken in recent years. Ms. Yu said that her customers prioritized “an emphasis on the quality of leather, design and functionality” over the logo.        
“Even when it comes to brands with champion logos like Gucci and Fendi, it’s the logo-free versions that sell better,” Ms. Sarokin said, adding, “This is a trend that is happening internationally, including places like Russia and the Far East.”        
A new generation of British handbag labels have a similar approach, including Fleet Ilya, Danielle Foster and Golden Lane, as do international labels like Kara and Mansur Gavriel.        
Ms. Hulme said that she was aware of the danger that the middle-price market could become saturated, and she has responded by selling through premium retailers and by sharpening focus on her ready-to-wear collection, which has increased to 110 pieces for spring 2014 from 30 pieces for spring 2013.        
She also has been contemplating new categories and will be introducing sunglasses next year.        
“The handbags are important, but they can’t be everything,” Ms. Hulme said. “The brands I admire have a clear vision that works across categories. I just need to take it slowly so that I get it right.”

Sports,"










In 1987, shortly after I turned 8, I began to lobby my parents for a chance to play tackle football. My father was the coach of a high school freshman team, so in a way, I had been raised around the game.        


Because of my age, my parents had reservations, but they agreed to attend an open house with the men who would be coaching the Pop Warner team. Afterward, my parents still weren’t convinced. What persuaded them? According to my father, I walked to the car, in tears, head down, mumbling about how I’d “never get to play football.”        
Two months later, I was experiencing drills like “bull in the ring,” in which a player is surrounded by teammates who repeatedly rush at him. Cracking skulls, as they used to say.        
It was tackle football. And I loved it.        
For much of my playing career, most parents with young children who played football were most interested in my workout regimen and what supplements I was taking. Those conversations have shifted significantly in the last few years. Now the most common question, by far, is, “Would you let your son play football?”        
My response was usually a resounding “No.”        
Right around the time those questions started, I developed a deep love-hate relationship with the game. I loved playing on Sundays. I loved the paychecks. I loved the guys in the locker room. But I hated what football was doing to so many people around me, and I hated what it was probably doing to me.        
There seemed to be red flags everywhere, and even if I couldn’t state with certainty that the game caused each and every ailment that so many of my friends were experiencing, the evidence was mounting quickly.        
I found myself receiving e-mail after e-mail from people presumably motivated by keyword searches for “football, concussion, trauma, disease.” Every new study drawing a correlation between head injuries and postcareer brain disease would find its way to my in-box, almost daily. Combine that with phone calls from former teammates who were struggling and the headlines of yet another fallen former player, and I began to hate the game.        
But was this merely an emotional reaction and not necessarily an accurate reflection of an otherwise incredible football journey that spanned decades? Perhaps.        
First of all, I don’t even have a son, so it was probably a bit ridiculous for me to speculate. I realize there are girls who play football, but my daughters don’t have any interest, and I have no idea how I would respond to an 8-year-old boy begging me to play this game.        
Second, football gave me so much. How can I bash a game that produced so many friendships, paid for part of my education and helped me become comfortable financially?        
And third, football is safer than it has ever been, right?        
Right?        
I honestly have no idea how to answer that question. Sure, training camp is easier than it used to be, and everyone is smarter about limiting in-practice contact. But once the games start, football is football. And nothing is ever going to change that unless you drastically change the game. I’m no expert in physics, but there’s no doubt N.F.L. players are bigger, faster and stronger than they’ve ever been. As a result, there is more velocity at the point of contact than there has ever been. I hate to say it, but no “Heads Up” campaign or the threat of a penalty or a fine will reduce football’s inherent violence. The latest dark reminder came Monday, when a 16-year-old high school player from Brocton, N.Y., died after a helmet-to-helmet hit in a game Friday night.        
Certainly there are lessons to be learned from playing football, about toughness, battling through adversity, and teamwork. But I don’t think football is the only way to teach those. I have numerous friends who never played football but who have battled through failed bar exams, medical residencies and struggling businesses, and who are just as successful as I am. In truth, they are probably a lot more well adjusted, well balanced and better positioned to navigate life’s speed bumps than I’ll ever be. Maybe they never had to push through pain and mask injuries the way I have, but is that really a virtue?        
Still, now that I’m retired from football, I know now more than ever that I absolutely loved playing the game. And now I actually get paid to talk about football on television. Imagine the hypocrisy. Here I am questioning whether children should be playing the game at all, and I’m basically selling the game to children watching at home. There’s certainly some internal conflict with that.        
And just because football worked out well for me, that doesn’t mean it will work out well for everyone. The odds are just too daunting.        
So maybe the more appropriate question is, If I could do it all over again, would I? The answer: Absolutely. Without hesitation.        
I recently asked my parents the same question, separately: “Knowing what you know now, would you have said yes after that meeting over 25 years ago?”        
My mother, without hesitation: “No, it’s just not worth the risk. We’ve loved being on this journey with you and it’s brought us so much joy, but I’d rather see you live a long and healthy life.”        
My father, the former football coach, after a long hesitation: “Yes, but I wouldn’t let you start so soon.”        
He added, “Football isn’t for everyone, Scott.”        
He’s right. It’s not for everyone. But it was definitely for me. And it is definitely for a lot of other people, too. So, just because I am torn about the game, it’s not my responsibility to make other parents’ decisions for them. But I do feel an obligation to inform them.        
I’m a former player now, and concerned parents continue to ask me, “Scott, would you let your son play football?”        
And how do I respond?        
“I’m just glad I have three daughters and will never have that conversation.”

LONDON — Lightness — in both fabric and color — has been a theme of the London season.        


Peter Pilotto, the label that is the joint work of the namesake designer and Christopher de Vos, will soon be light in a different sense: on the purse strings.        
A specially conceived collection for the U.S. retail chain Target will be introduced Feb. 9 — news that the duo flashed up in neon letters on the catwalk.        
Maybe it was looking through their not-so-old archives that made the collection look like Peter Pilotto’s greatest hits: the familiar vivid colors in digital patterns, and especially the full bouncy skirts that other designers of their generation are leaving behind.        
Thomas Tait’s show on Tuesday started as a light, white story — to a fault, even if the clean lines and single colors were finally challenged by the interjection of bright graphic lines at the neck in green, orange and turquoise.        
Mr. Tait has a clean, sleek way with minimalism. And considering the searing colors and patterns on the London scene, this quiet was refreshing. Yet, among the blush pink silvered dresses and coral and white coat, there was not quite enough insertion of unexpected fabric or texture, which would have made the collection take off.        
Giles Deacon, like all good designers, knows how to step out of the box that contains his own heritage. His Giles collection was less historical, more modernist, with his blown-up patterns of the faces of the models Kate Moss and Amber Valletta on simple short or long dresses.        
There was a darkness to the collection in both its colors and its spirit, enhanced by Giles, as he is known, using his preferred setting of an old Hogwarts-style great hall. Bats — not in the belfry but as witchy black hats — added to the dark spirit.        
The Chinese designer Huishan Zhang explained how each line of airy squares that made up the lean-line dresses or slender stops and skirts in his collection were measured piece by piece in his studio, as if it were a mathematics class.        
The result could best be defined as pretty precision: with colors like coral for a tunic over pants; and with black pieces transformed by mesh, lace and those translucent squares. The designer’s inspiration? Madeleine Vionnet and her couture techniques — and the skills learned from his training at Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design in London.        
The work done by the Italian designer Massimo Nicosia at Pringle of Scotland is impressive, with so many different techniques of classic knit and modernized macramé. Outstanding were the broken diamonds, taking an age-old pattern but shaking it into the 21st century.        
British heritage collections are increasingly about adding new skills in the spirit of the old.

The best wines for these vegan lunch and dinner dishes come from the Mediterranean-style repertory: dry rosés, crisp whites, earthy reds.        
The more important question is whether you want a vegan wine, too. Many people are not aware that wines may be clarified, or fined, with products derived from animals. This process may use ingredients like egg whites or isinglass (derived from fish bladders) to remove minute particles from the wine. These fining agents are then removed, but trace elements may remain, ruling out the wines for vegans.        
How can you tell if a wine is vegan? Some wines may not be fined, or may be fined with a clay-based ingredient like bentonite. But it is difficult to know for sure unless a wine is labeled “unfined,” or includes an ingredients list. Few wines list ingredients, but producers like Ridge, Bonny Doon Vineyard and Shinn Estate are leading the way. And their wines are very good.

LONDON — Plunging into the tank, swimsuits sculpted over athletic bodies, the synchronized swimmers faced off another group of women swinging above in graceful aerial movements. Their outfits, in turquoise, pistachio green and silver gray, were a poetic mix-and-match for performance clothing.        


“It is so amazing to have the opportunity to work with true sports performers within the context of London Fashion Week,” said Stella McCartney, whose range Adidas by Stella McCartney had an engaging and energetic outing on Tuesday, the last day of the London 2014 summer shows.        
Ms. McCartney really gets the female sporting life. And the Adidas line is an ergonomic extension of the clothes she believes in. Athletes in navy shorts and orange tops matched the exercise bikes in the spin class; and floral daisy prints on casual wear were a girly way of facing the treadmill.        
The aerobic finale was a fitness routine based on the work of Tracy Anderson, the personal trainer to Ms. McCartney and Gwyneth Paltrow. The two friends also recently teamed up to create a mini collection for sale on Goop.com, the movie star’s lifestyle Web site.        
Even for handbags, Tuesday was a moment for tightropes and trapezes, as Anya Hindmarch had purses shaped like crumpled potato chip bags, bold handbags in bright colors and carry bags with smiley faces — all swinging on ropes above the runway.        
That same athleticism applied also to the models, who carried the soft bags tucked around their wrists and wore sporty stretch dresses, until they morphed into acrobats and joined the bags swinging on ropes.        
“It is all about weightlessness — light, up in the air,” said Ms. Hindmarch backstage, referring to a featherweight white leather shopper with a blue lining, although there were other similar bags in butter-soft calf or natural python.        
Color came as nectarine leather with matching tassel and royal blue nylon lining; or as ball-shaped bags like glowing globes. The designer always brings wit and fun to her shows, but this one seemed particularly on target.

The Internal Revenue Service recently decided that for same-sex couples filing federal income taxes, married means married — regardless of where you and your spouse live. The Social Security Administration, however, hasn’t officially come to the same determination yet regarding potentially valuable spousal benefits.        


The agency says it is studying the applicable law with the Justice Department. But it is urging same-sex couples to apply for benefits anyway — even if they live in a state that doesn’t recognize their marriage.        
What’s more, the agency also is inviting applications not just from those in same-sex marriages, but also those in other legal same-sex relationships, like civil unions or registered domestic partnerships.        
Applying as soon as possible is important, because if you are ultimately found eligible, you can get benefits retroactive to your filing date.        
“In the coming weeks and months, we will develop and implement additional policy and processing instructions,” the message says. “If you are in a same-sex marriage or other legal same-sex relationship, even if you live in a state that prohibits same-sex marriage, we encourage you to apply right away.”        
“That’s huge,” said Mary Bonauto, civil rights project director with the Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) in Boston.        
Social Security offers a range of financial benefits for spouses and families. You can file for retirement benefits based on your spouse’s work record, for instance, which entitles you to more money if your spouse earned more than you, or to delay tapping your own benefits.        
You can also receive “surviving spouse” benefits after your spouse dies. For example, you can receive a one-time payment of $255. And you can get your deceased spouse’s higher retirement payout instead of your own.        
The Social Security Administration’s Web site says it is now processing some spousal retirement claims and paying them when due. If you and your spouse live in a state where same-sex marriage is sanctioned, and you meet other criteria (see below), the application should be straightforward. An unresolved question, however, is whether couples who were legally married in one state but moved to another state that doesn’t recognize gay marriage can get the same benefits. That’s because the Social Security Administration currently uses a “place of residence” standard in deciding spousal benefits.        
Susan Sommer, senior counsel with the gay rights group Lambda Legal, said Social Security had instructed its staff to accept and hold such applications, pending further legal clarification. “We’re awaiting guidance, and we’re really hopeful,” she said.        
The agency also is holding other types of applications for now, like those for survivor benefits when one spouse dies. However, Ms. Bonauto said she was encouraged by the case of 83-year-old Herb Burtis, a musician and voice teacher in Western Massachusetts. Mr. Burtis had applied for survivor benefits after his husband died in 2008. (They married in 2004, when Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage). His late husband’s monthly retirement benefits were $700 higher because he had earned more than Mr. Burtis, and Mr. Burtis filed a claim for the extra payment. His application was initially denied. But he became a plaintiff in a lawsuit that successfully challenged the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which was struck down in June by the United States Supreme Court. He is now getting the extra money, and also received a lump-sum payment for the last five years.        
Ms. Bonauto said there was “every reason to expect” that the agency would eventually process and pay survivor benefits to other eligible same-sex applicants.        
Here are some questions to consider:        
■ How do I know if I’m eligible for benefits? 
You must meet certain criteria. For instance, to receive spousal retirement benefits, you generally must be at least 62 and have been married for at least 12 months; for the survivor’s benefit, you must be at least 60 and have been married for nine months. If you meet age and duration requirements, Ms. Bonauto said, you should apply for benefits, even in the face of other uncertainties.        
■ How do I apply? 
You can apply online at www.ssa.gov forspousal retirement benefits. But you must apply for survivor’s benefits by calling or visiting a local Social Security office; make an appointment before you go. GLAD advises you to bring a copy of your marriage license, or your civil union or domestic partnership certificate, and a copy of your spouse’s death certificate.        
■ What if I have questions? 
Contact the regional communications director for your state. A list is available on the Social Security Web site.

LOS ANGELES — The Chinese film company Dalian Wanda Group has kept a low profile since acquiring AMC Entertainment last year for about $2.6 billion, but no more.        
On Tuesday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Wanda had donated $20 million toward the Academy’s campaign to build a motion picture museum here. The gift is the second largest to date, behind a $25 million commitment from David Geffen.        
In recognition of the gift, the academy said it would name the museum’s planned film history gallery for Wanda, which became a player in the North American market through the AMC purchase.        
“Our relationship with the Academy is an important part of our role in the global motion picture industry,” Jianlin Wang, Wanda’s chairman, said in a statement.        
The academy has said it hopes to raise $300 million to finance the museum, which is scheduled to open in 2017.

LONDON — When the British heritage brand Belstaff opened a new shop on Bond Street in London this past weekend, the first man to take a look at the historic motorcycles on display along with the brand’s iconic four-pocket leather jackets was David Beckham. The soccer star, now a Belstaff ambassador, also is a fan of motorbikes.        


Suzy Menkes talked with Mr. Beckham and with Harry Slatkin, the chief executive of Belstaff, which is part of the Labelux Group that also owns Bally and Jimmy Choo.        
So David Beckham, are you a Steve McQueen, in your heart do you love bikes?        
A. I love to ride bikes. I’m honored that anyone mentions me in the same breath as Steve McQueen, because obviously I’m a huge fan of his for many reasons, for his talent and obviously his looks, his fashion sense. And obviously to be part of Belstaff now, that he was kind of the first person that introduced it to the world — yeah, I’m hugely honored; it means a lot.        
I went on a trip a few weeks back in California, up to wine country, which was a five-day ride, which was nice. I’m looking forward to spending more time on the bike, it was obviously virtually impossible while we were still playing. But now I’ve stopped, I’ve kind of got more time on my hands, or I’m going to different parts where I’m able to do that — so for that I’m excited.        
Q. What about your children, do you let them ride bikes? 
A. They have got motocross bikes, which, before they get on the bikes, they are totally covered in every piece of armor to keep them safe. They’re very sensible on the bikes right now. So I let them ride, but on the roads, obviously not yet.        
Q. Obviously now, being connected with Belstaff, this is one of these real hook-ups. You really are someone who is interested in buying some things, interested in what Belstaff sells? 
A. I think that’s what’s interesting about this amazing partnership. You know, it’s such a great fit. We did the actual campaign shoot yesterday with Peter Lindbergh, and everything that I wore on the shoot was things that I already wear. The bikes were exactly the same as the bikes that I ride. So to be part of a brand that is so fitting with what I do every day and what I wear every day is great. It’s easy for me.        
Q. Mr. Slatkin, the whole idea of a British heritage brand being involved with motorbikes — do you want to get that over in the store?  
A. It is how we started. All our clothes were originally made for motorbike racing and for automobile racing in the ’20s — we started in 1924.        
All the fabrics, like the waxed cotton which we invented, are protected fabrics, so you can wear them outdoors, in the rain or in any weather. And as you know, in England you have a lot of rain. So really that is our heritage.        
The bike when you first walk into the store is a 1924 racing bike, so it is all about celebrating our heritage. We will be 90 years old next year, and I am feeling it after opening this store. We are celebrating our happiest moments since the launch of Belstaff.        
Your great moment is to be able to announce during London Fashion Week that David Beckham is now the ambassador for Belstaff. Is David a great bike man?        
A. David is an amazing bike man. He has 12 motorbikes of his own. Out of clothes he must look amazing — but in Belstaff he looks even better.

RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, said Tuesday that she was postponing a state visit to the United States, delivering a sharp rebuke to the Obama administration over revelations that the National Security Agency had spied on her, her inner circle of top aides and Brazil’s largest company, the oil giant Petrobras.        


The move by Ms. Rousseff showed how the disclosures of United States surveillance practices by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, were aggravating Washington’s ties with an array of nations, including European allies like Germany.        
In the case of Brazil, Latin America’s largest nation, the move to effectively suspend a state visit to the United States — a remarkably rare decision in the annals of diplomacy — threatens to unravel years of Washington’s efforts to recognize Brazil’s rising profile in the developing world and blunt the growing influence of China, which has surpassed the United States as Brazil’s top trading partner.        
President Obama spoke with Ms. Rousseff by telephone for 20 minutes on Monday night, but failed to persuade her to go through with the visit, which had been scheduled for late October. A series of news reports about N.S.A. spying in Brazil had clearly irked Ms. Rousseff in recent weeks, and her government demanded a full explanation from Washington.        
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had called Ms. Rousseff to try to ease tension over the spying revelations, and Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Brazil to discuss the matter, with officials in Brasília publicly criticizing his explanations as unsatisfactory. Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, said last week that reports about the N.S.A.’s activities in Brazil had raised “legitimate questions,” a statement falling short of Brazil’s expectations.        
“Washington doesn’t do contrition very well,” said Julia E. Sweig, director for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, emphasizing how the relationship between United States and Brazil was still not strong enough to withstand the turmoil over the N.S.A. revelations.        
The White House insisted in a statement on Tuesday that the “broad relationship” between Brazil and the United States “should not be overshadowed by a single bilateral issue, no matter how important or challenging the issue may be.” For that reason, the statement said, Mr. Obama and Ms. Rousseff agreed to postpone the visit to an undetermined time.        
In addition to their telephone conversation on Monday night, Ms. Rousseff and Mr. Obama had discussed the N.S.A. revelations during the meeting of Group of 20 leaders in St. Petersburg, Russia, this month, the White House pointed out.        
“The president has said that he understands and regrets the concerns that disclosures of alleged U.S. intelligence activities have generated in Brazil and made clear that he is committed to working together with President Rousseff and her government in diplomatic channels to move beyond this issue as a source of tension in our bilateral relationship,” the statement said.        
The White House also said that a broad review of the American intelligence posture would take several months to complete, and that the leaders had agreed that the visit should be delayed until the spying issue was resolved.        
Meanwhile, while commerce is still thriving between Brazil and the United States, business leaders and trade experts in both countries were trying to gauge how putting the visit off would affect efforts to bolster ties.        
“It’s simply disappointing to see this turn in policy,” said Christian Lohbauer, a political scientist at the University of São Paulo who has represented Brazilian exporters of orange juice. “The diplomatic agenda should be focused on what’s practical for both nations, which in Brazil’s case is developing its economy through strong relations with a country like the United States.”        
But even before Ms. Rousseff’s announcement, expectations were low for the concrete results of the state visit. No major trade agreement was anticipated, and Washington has refrained from explicitly supporting Brazil’s bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, as Mr. Obama did for India in 2010.        
Ahead of 2014 elections, Ms. Rousseff stands to gain among some elements within the governing Workers Party by meeting their demands for a strong response on the spying issue, but political analysts here pointed out that Brazil’s move was still relatively mild, and avoided the expulsion of United States diplomats or limits on investments by American companies.        
“It’s a friction point in relations but not a breakup,” said Geraldo Zahran, a specialist on Brazil’s ties with the United States at Pontifical Catholic University in São Paulo.        
Still, others assailed Washington’s response to Brazil in the face of growing ire over the espionage revelations, reports of which have been televised nationally for weeks. As resentment festered in Brasília, the Obama administration seemed to put the tension with Brazil on the back burner, focusing on other issues like Syria.        
“The inaction in the face of such an overreach has proved costly,” said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy group, about the administration’s efforts to offset the damage caused by the spying. “Washington would be wise to reflect on what this means for its most crucial diplomatic efforts in this hemisphere.”

"
Travel,"










If you followed my summer road trip from Baton Rouge, La., to Fargo, N.D., you may have wondered how I got from New York to my starting point in the first place. I drove 20 hours. Alone. It was far cheaper than flying into Louisiana — then having to rent a car, pay a (huge) drop-off fee in North Dakota and fly home.        


I had hoped for company, to split both the driving and $175 or so in gas and tolls. So about a week before my trip, I posted my route on three ride-share sites: Zimride.com, eRideShare.com and Ridester.com. And got not a peep.        
With economic pressures pushing travelers to share resources whenever possible (and various online services making that ever easier), I wondered how this was possible. Did I do something wrong? Were the sites inadequate? Or were there simply not enough people out there looking for such a ride? The answer turned out to be a bit of each. Ride-sharing’s move from campus bulletin board to Internet had been less successful than expected. And though it’s still a potential moneysaver for travelers, that’s mostly for distances easily covered in a day. So what could I have done better?        
My first mistake: not posting everywhere I should have. I did the right thing by listing my ride — at no charge — on the sites mentioned above. But I missed the biggest player in the game: crusty old Craigslist. Sure, it lacks maps or calendars or user profiles or reviews or a way to pay in advance by credit card — and, not incidentally, there’s little recourse if things go wrong. But it has the rides: more, and more widespread, at least based on my unscientific survey, than the other sites.        
Luckily, the second-biggest number of listings seem to be on the most user-friendly site, Zimride. The process for listing and booking rides is roughly similar to that for rooms on Airbnb.com, although Zimride doesn’t take a cut, so you can choose between booking online or contacting the driver directly to make arrangements. Other great features: its profiles are Facebook-connected (meaning you can do a little online research into your potential travel partners), and its algorithm often matches people with different but potentially overlapping routes. (For example, it might have found me someone who was going from Baltimore to Atlanta, a nice chunk of my journey.)        
In July, Zimride was bought by Enterprise Holdings, known mostly for its car rental companies. But according to a spokeswoman, Laura Bryant, they have “no plans to change anything.”        
That seems like a smart move to me — even more so now that I’ve spoken to several Zimride users I contacted at random through the site. They were all enthusiastic users who had saved money — though the site doesn’t stand on its own, even for them; they had all found it necessary to find riders on Craigslist.        
They were a diverse bunch. Fabio Vargas, 29, travels most weekends between his home in Tallahassee and Orlando, Fla., to visit his family and girlfriend and takes along fellow riders when he can; he charges $25 per passenger and calculated his annual savings at $1,300. Paul Orsett, a 50-year-old public-school teacher from outside Raleigh, N.C., has used ride-sharing to save on trips across the country. Julia Lipianskaya, 23, a recent college graduate from Palo Alto, Calif., used to scramble to find friends to share the driving and gas costs to visit her family in the Bay Area, until she found Zimride in her senior year and started occasionally even turning a profit on her trips.        
All three took measures to reduce their risks, vetting potential riders online through Facebook and Google, and have occasionally rejected some. Mr. Orsett said passengers often vet him as well — like me, he’s in the prime potential-creep age range. He points them to the Web site of a local news station that featured him as “teacher of the week.” 
Ms. Lipianskaya originally took only women passengers, but gradually loosened her policy, especially if she clicked over from Zimride to the potential passenger’s Facebook profile and found mutual friends. “As a young woman traveling alone, it’s a little nerve-racking sometimes,” she said. “But I haven’t had any bad experiences. I just always bring pepper spray. I hope I never have to use it.”        
If you think this all sounds like too much work and risk, consider trying a Canadian and European service when going abroad. It turns out that the United States is way behind other countries in long-distance ride-sharing. (We’re doing better with intracity ride-sharing and taxilike services like Lyft, Uber and Sidecar.)        
Just across the border in Canada, Kangaride.com appears to be booming. It has a slick interface and has about 5,000 rides posted per week (both Zimride and Craigslist declined to provide numbers), including some between Montreal and New York or Boston. The trade-off is that Kangaride charges a yearly membership fee of 7.50 Canadian dollars (about the same in American dollars), and charges passengers a 5 dollar fee per ride. But that money goes toward a staff of 25, which checks drivers’ records under an agreement with several provincial governments, and monitors new members by following up with their passengers after trips.        
The site functions for trips within the United States as well, but it is not yet widely used. “As of now we’re focusing our marketing efforts on Canada,” said Robin Grantner, Kangaride’s communications coordinator. “But we would love to expand.” Let’s hope.        
Travelers to Europe might also consider looking for rides online before they book expensive train tickets or plan to suffer the indignities of low-cost airlines. The German site carpooling.com has around 30 drivers offering rides between Berlin and Munich each weekend (averaging 30 euros, about $38 at $1.28 to the euro, a fraction of the train fare), and also works across Europe. In Britain, the big success story is Liftshare.com, which currently claims around 37,000 long-distance rides listed. “People join up because they’re going to save half their travel costs or more,” said Ali Clabburn, the site’s founder. “But they come back again because they love the social side of it.”        
Mr. Clabburn added that one in 100 Britons has signed up, and that despite 100,000 people sharing cars every day, they have never had a reported safety incident.        
As for my return trip from Fargo? I persuaded two old friends to fly out to meet me for the drive home, which relieved me of the driving responsibilities but not the gas costs. Next road trip, I’ll post smarter and wider. Or just go to Canada.        



 



"
Culture,"










Nobody is really expecting to be the next Oprah Winfrey because that’s not going to happen, not even for Ms. Winfrey. But this fall, new aspirants are jostling for a perch on daytime television, and they seek a talk show less to cap a career than to expand their marketing horizons.        


Like a cookbook, a perfume or a clothing label, the daily talk show has become the latest form of brand extension: product placement of the persona.        
“The Queen Latifah Show” made its debut on Monday. Bethenny Frankel, an alumna of “The Real Housewives of New York City,” made her debut on Sept 9. Kris Jenner, mother of the Kardashian brood, ended a trial run last month.        
New faces are popping up on even the oldest shows. “Today” introduced Carson Daly as a co-host on Monday, though he was partially eclipsed by the show’s new blindingly bright orange set. Jenny McCarthy, an actress and former Playboy model who is better known these days as a champion of controversial alternative medical treatments, has joined “The View” as a host.        
At the start-up end of the spectrum, Meghan McCain, daughter of Senator John McCain, began an on-the-road talk show on Saturday, called “Raising McCain,” on Pivot, a new cable channel.        
Back in the days of Mike Douglas, Dinah Shore and Phil Donahue, a talk show was a goal in itself, either as a second act for older stars or as the apex to years of climbing the show business ladder. Now it’s added currency in the 24-hour-a-day business of being famous.        
The field is crowded. Some of the most seasoned and popular television personalities — Anderson Cooper, Jeff Probst and Ricki Lake — recently tried to host their own talk shows and flopped. Katie Couric’s show has held on, but the ratings are weaker than expected. At the moment, “Ellen” and “Dr. Phil” still lead the pack, but newer faces, including Wendy Williams and Steve Harvey, are holding their own. Like buying a lottery ticket, producing a talk show doesn’t cost much, and somewhere, sometime, someone is going to win big.        
What’s striking about the newcomers is that their celebrity rests as much on commercial savvy as on conventional artistic talent. Even Queen Latifah, an accomplished movie actress and singer, has her own one-woman enterprise, with a line of CoverGirl cosmetics and two perfumes (Queen and Queen of Hearts). She is the star of an ad for Zyrtec, the allergy medication. She has also, despite the apparent contradiction, been a spokeswoman for both Pizza Hut and Jenny Craig.        
For her debut, Queen Latifah chose to go old school. She asked one of Ms. Winfrey’s favorite guests, John Travolta, to help kick off her talk show, and brought in Will Smith, an executive producer of her show, on Tuesday. Like Ms. Winfrey, she mingled celebrities and inspirational segments about deserving unknowns: she made over a classroom for a high school music teacher and his students, and helped war widows experience adventure travel. Tuesday’s show was more animated than the premiere, but still surprisingly sluggish. The more dynamic moments were glossy CoverGirl ads that star the host and punctuate the show.        
Ms. Frankel doesn’t sing, dance or act, but she has parlayed her popularity on reality shows into an emporium of Skinnygirl products, from best-selling diet and advice books to her own Skinnygirl label of low-calorie wines, spirits and cocktails, which was bought by Beam, the company better known for bourbon.        
Alternately brash, tearful, empathetic, zany, bossy and boastful, Ms. Frankel is a multipolar television personality. “Bethenny” is a dizzying carnival of girl-power news you can use and too much information, including where and how much Ms. Frankel waxes: she makes “Ellen” look like the “PBS NewsHour.”        
And Ms. Frankel seems to view her latest venture as a commitment she makes time for, not the pinnacle of her career. She said last week that she took a moment before each show to regroup, because, “I really want to be here for you, I want it to be kind of an hour that we just spend together, and I am focused and I am not thinking about anything else.”

"
Dining,"










SOUTH AMBOY, N.J. — “I was thinking maybe we should get some Def Leppard going,” Bill Telepan said, nodding toward the tabletop jukebox at the Peterpank Diner on Route 9. He was recalling the nights he spent here in the 1980s, with “that feathered Jersey hair and big glasses,” joking around with friends, listening to tunes and consuming plate after plate of onion rings.        


If, back then, someone had told Mr. Telepan that a rendition of those onion rings would someday appear on the menu of a sophisticated restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan — a restaurant with his own surname on the awning — he probably would have laughed it off and cranked up the hair metal. In those days, he accumulated plenty of experience working in restaurants in and around Sayreville, N.J., his hometown, but he didn’t imagine a career in cooking. He had a sensible plan. He wanted to attend community college and become an electrical engineer.        
But sensible lost out. “It just wasn’t for me,” he said. “I missed cooking. I missed the energy of it.”        
Pretty soon he enrolled in the Culinary Institute of America; then came passages in the kitchens at Le Bernardin and Le Cirque and Gotham Bar & Grill, and a triumphant run at Judson Grill, and, in 2005, the debut of his namesake restaurant on West 69th Street.        
Still, it’s more than a figure of speech to say that Mr. Telepan, who’s now 47, never forgot his Route 9 roots. Drop by his restaurant for lunch and you’ll find a burger on the menu — a burger that’s accompanied by a “volcano” of molten crunch. “It’s an onion-ring mountain with French-fry lava,” the chef explained. “That’s the Jersey in me.” (Of course, Mr. Telepan and his crew deepen the flavor of the rings by dunking them in a batter made with a sourdough starter that dates back to 1996.)        
These days Mr. Telepan finds himself at a pivotal moment: he just finished a renovation at Telepan, and he’s about to open a tapas-style TriBeCa offshoot, Telepan Local, in November. So this summer he was in the mood to head back to a few New Jersey haunts that have been a stealth influence on his handiwork. “Subconsciously, all this stuff comes back to me,” he said.        
The dip into his subconscious started at the Peterpank, where he surmised that the onion rings were probably frozen — until a server, Aprilynn Raslowsky, piped up to correct him.        
“They make them here,” she said. “They always have.”        
Mr. Telepan’s face broke into a grin. “Awesome,” he said.        
Next it was off to the Jersey Shore. During the summer months of his childhood, Mr. Telepan would make himself at home among the thrill rides and food stalls of Point Pleasant Beach. He wanted to try a slice of pizza at Martell’s Tiki Bar, a longtime party spot that, almost a year ago, had a strip of its pier torn out by Hurricane Sandy. “I’m just hoping it hasn’t changed,” he said.        
Going back to the Boardwalk qualified as a minor revelation. Somehow Martell’s was back in full swing, and the slice, upon which Mr. Telepan administered a blizzard of oregano and pepper flakes and Parmesan, rocked. “Thin crust,” he said, folding it before taking a serious bite. “A good amount of everything. Very well balanced.”        
Mr. Telepan ended his Jersey sojourn in the town of Linden, where his father, George, used to work on the assembly line at a General Motors plant that no longer exists, and where his mother’s family used to gather at a Hungarian social club that still does. (His mother’s roots are in Hungary, his father’s in Slovakia.)        
Telepan’s menu has featured a surprising number of dishes with an Eastern European lineage: chicken paprikash, stuffed cabbage, pork sausage. The chef can trace it all back to his mother’s cooking. And when anyone died, it was customary for survivors to console themselves with similar fare at Big Stash, a community fixture in Linden.        
“All right, Big Stash’s!” he exclaimed as he rolled into the restaurant. “First time I’m here that it wasn’t a funeral.”        
He ordered pierogis, sausage, stuffed cabbage. He was pleased. He grabbed his phone. He had an impulse to call his mother, Evelyn, just to let her know where he was. “We got stuffed cabbage,” he told her. “Which wasn’t as good as yours.”

In 1994, just before they were married, Mary Beth Kraese, who runs a marketing and social media business from her home, and her husband, Phillip, a steamfitter, bought a home in the community of South Huntington. Mr. Kraese had grown up in the neighborhood and she had spent her youth just to the north in Huntington Station.        


“I crossed Jericho,” she said, referring to Jericho Turnpike. The busy commercial street, rife with car dealerships, divides Huntington Station from South Huntington — a census-designated place, or hamlet, in the heart of Long Island.        
Ms. Kraese, who volunteers with a first aid squad and a fire department, said she doesn’t feel that she left her childhood friends behind, because she runs into them frequently, as happened recently when she entered a Panera Bread cafe at the southern end of the Walt Whitman Shops, which was until recently called the Walt Whitman Mall. The mall is a prominent feature in South Huntington, but the hamlet’s side streets are generally tree-lined and quiet.        
Like many Long Island communities, South Huntington has overlapping designations. Addresses use the Huntington Station ZIP code of 11746, but South Huntington is also the name of the school district that serves part of Huntington Station and other areas. The Huntington Manor Fire Department encompasses both areas and bits of others.        
David Gillmor, who recently moved from Huntington Station to South Huntington, is enthusiastic about his new home. “We think the area is awesome,” said Mr. Gillmor, who sells commercial doors and hardware in a family business in Huntington Station.        
When he and his wife, Melissa, began looking for a larger home, they first considered Centerport or Greenlawn, both part of the highly regarded Harborfields Central School District. But the properties were beyond their budget, he said. In South Huntington, they found a five-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath colonial on nearly half an acre “where my son can ride his bike in the street.” He said he paid less than the list price of $439,000.        
“We didn’t want to pay more just for a school district,” Mr. Gillmor said. “We’re very happy with this district.”        
When he enrolled his son, Nicholas, now 6, in kindergarten last year, he said, he was impressed that teachers spoke highly of David P. Bennardo, the new district superintendent, who was previously the principal of Harborfields High School. He liked the district’s full-day kindergarten — he also has a 3-year-old daughter, Holly — and dual-language program in kindergarten through fifth grade.        
South Huntington, said Elke B. Mariotti, a real estate agent with Signature Premier Properties, is especially convenient for workers in the many large office parks in Melville, immediately to the south.        
Paul Dougherty, a sales associate with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage who moved to South Huntington from Centerport a year ago, said he likes the variety of home styles. “It’s more eclectic.”        
South Huntington attracts many young families, said Wedrich A. Joubert, an agent with Realty Connect, because it offers affordable prices and larger properties for those who want more land.        
What You’ll Find 
With a population of 9,422, according to the 2010 census, on 3.4 square miles, South Huntington is part of the Town of Huntington. It is surrounded by Huntington Station, Elwood, Dix Hills, Melville and West Hills. Its northern boundary is Jericho Turnpike and part of its southern boundary is the Northern State Parkway. The median household income, according the U.S. Census Bureau, is $88,666, and 87 percent of its residents are white.        
Homes range from bungalows on tiny plots to colonials on an acre or more. Though residential streets are mostly traffic-free, the major thoroughfares, including Jericho Turnpike and Route 110, called Walt Whitman Road in this area, are busy. The two major projects under way are an expansion of the Walt Whitman Shops on Walt Whitman Road, and the addition of a Target store around the corner on Jericho Turnpike.        
Starting last spring, the upscale mall, which had more than a million square feet of retail space, has been renovating and adding 72,000 more square feet, as well as new stores, including Henri Bendel, Kate Spade, Swarovski and Hugo Boss.        
Ms. Kraese said the new Target has been a hot topic among her friends, who look forward to a new meeting place. “It’s the talk of the town, absolutely,” she said.

Matt Harvey’s right elbow felt fine Tuesday. He did not have the numbness, the tingling, the shooting pain often associated with elbow issues. He did not feel any pain.        


Last month, when his forearm felt tender and the discomfort grew worse, he reported it to the Mets’ medical staff and was found to have a partly torn ulnar collateral ligament. It was suggested that he may need surgery.        
On Tuesday, the day after he received a second opinion from Dr. James Andrews, a noted orthopedist, it was announced that Harvey would not have Tommy John surgery.        
Instead, he will undertake a structured rehabilitation program outlined by Andrews that will last about six to eight weeks.        
However, if the forearm troubles return, if he has numbness, tingling or shooting pain, Harvey conceded that “something needs to get done.”        
Surgery would be necessary and keep him out for about a year. Harvey said he would rather bet on himself rehabilitating the elbow than having the surgery to be safe. He noted how Andrews had tested the elbow and found “nothing was moving in places it shouldn’t.”        
Harvey added, “He believed that it was very stable.”        
When Harvey’s injury was discovered after he allowed 13 hits in a loss to the Detroit Tigers in late August, General Manager Sandy Alderson indicated that Harvey should have surgery and not attempt to pitch, be hurt later and potentially miss time in 2015. Alderson, who sat next to Harvey at Tuesday’s news conference, said that surgery was still an option.        
“I think there’s some ambiguity at this point, and maybe through the next couple of months,” Alderson said, adding that he wanted to see how Harvey responded to rehab. Alderson, pointing to the Mets’ glut of young pitching, indicated he was not worried about replacing Harvey for 2014, even if his status remained uncertain. For now, though, the possibility remains that Harvey can pitch opening day in 2014. The throwing program will be outlined in the coming days, Alderson said.        
“We’re all going to be watching each and every little step he takes,” Mets Manager Terry Collins said, adding, “We’re all behind him, and he knows that.”        
Harvey had a sensational season. On three occasions, he flirted with a no-hitter or a perfect game. His fastballs were a blur. His sliders snapped away from bats. In 26 games, he had a 2.27 earned run average.        
He started the All-Star Game for the National League at Citi Field, and it was as if the Mets’ star was on display, for all the game to see. He pitched two scoreless innings. He struck out two premier sluggers, Miguel Cabrera and Jose Bautista, swinging on filthy sliders, and Adam Jones, swinging on a 98 mile-per-hour fastball.        
His fame grew. He made television appearances and magazine covers. He had, perhaps just as much as David Wright, become the face of the Mets.        
And the Mets had planned to protect him, hold him to 215 innings this year, or maybe fewer, between 200 and 205. He had nearly reached 180 innings when he was sidelined.        
Now if Harvey goes through the throwing program with no problem, the Mets will surely do their best to protect Harvey and his elbow and treat it with utmost importance.        
INSIDE PITCH        
David Wright (strained hamstring) could return this weekend, against Philadelphia, at the earliest, Terry Collins said. By then, there will be, at most, 10 games left this season. ... The former Met Angel Pagan had three hits, including a home run, and drove in three runs, as the San Francisco Giants beat the Mets, 8-5, on Tuesday night Citi Field. Zack Wheeler allowed four earned runs in five innings, walking six. Sean Henn took the loss.

Among the most troubling questions facing consumers as they shop for insurance under the Obama administration’s new health care law is whether the plans will cover the drugs they take — and how much they will have to pay for them.        


But with less than two weeks remaining until enrollment opens on Oct. 1, the answers are still elusive and anxiety is growing for consumers whose well-being depends on expensive medications.        
States running the marketplaces where the plans will be offered have not released details about which drugs will be covered. Insurers have said little about how much consumers will be asked to contribute or what types of restrictions will be placed on certain medicines. Of the few states that have revealed specifics, some have plans that will require patients to contribute as much as 50 percent of the cost of the most expensive drugs.        
“I’ve got to be honest and say I’m a little bit nervous,” said Jessica Thomas, a mental health counselor in North Carolina who takes the drug Tecfidera to treat her multiple sclerosis.        
Ms. Thomas, 34, has been enrolled for two years in a program for people with expensive medical conditions that is run by North Carolina. But that program is ending in December, and she must select a new plan in the state marketplace. At the top of her mind is how much she will have to pay for Tecfidera, which costs more than $4,000 a month. “I think that’s the hard thing right now is that it’s the unknown, deciding what the financial cost will be,” she said.        
The picture will not get immediately clearer once enrollment begins. Without a central hub for evaluating drug coverage, patient advocacy groups say they are already warning their members to prepare for a tedious slog through Web sites, downloaded records and phone calls to customer service hot lines.        
“I had frankly expected a higher level of transparency by this point,” said Brian Rosen, the senior vice president for government and public affairs at the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.        
Insurers and officials in the Obama administration are counseling patience, saying consumers will have six months, once enrollment opens, to choose a plan that is right for them. The administration asserts that chronically ill patients are among the biggest beneficiaries of the new law, given that insurers are now prevented from denying them coverage and cannot charge them higher premiums because of their illness.        
“For many Americans, these changes will mean that a diagnosis no longer means choosing between facing bankruptcy or ignoring care,” said Erin Shields Britt, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.        
Others say some initial uncertainty and even confusion are to be expected. “I think you have to walk before you can run,” said Karen Ignagni, president and chief executive of America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group. “This is a massive undertaking.”        
The plans offered in the marketplaces must cover a minimum number of drugs in every treatment category, with the exact count set by a representative commercial plan, known as a benchmark plan, that is designated in each state.        
Oregon, Virginia, Connecticut and other states plan to cover more than 97 percent of drugs, while others like Maryland, Colorado and California plan to cover 54 to 84 percent, according to an analysis by Avalere Health, a consulting firm. Patients can lobby for an exception if they can demonstrate that a drug not covered by their plan is medically necessary.        
But how many drugs will be offered under the plans is only a starting point. Perhaps more significant is how much patients will be asked to contribute toward the cost of those drugs. Only a handful of states have released those details, but advocates for patients with chronic diseases and those in the drug industry say they are troubled by what they have seen so far.

AMC is having a hard time separating from its hit series. On Tuesday the network announced that instead of a final season of “Mad Men,” as was planned for next spring, the much-acclaimed series will divide in two, pushing off the finale for another year.         
A day earlier, the network announced it would spin off a new series from its hit zombie show “The Walking Dead” and last week it made a deal to spin off a show from “Breaking Bad.”        
In the case of “Mad Men,” AMC is following the strategy it took with “Breaking Bad” in dividing up a planned final season into two installments, and it will be waiting a full year between seven-episode arcs. That means the final season is really two entirely separate ones, at least in terms of scheduling.        
The first seven shows will be shown next spring under the title “The Beginning.” The second group will be shown in 2015 and will be called “The End of an Era.""’ Variety reported that the writing staff for the final season will include the Oscar-winning screenwriter Robert Towne, who will be designated a consulting producer.        
The show’s creator, Matthew Weiner, will shoot all the episodes in one production cycle, so in effect, AMC will simply be storing away the last seven episodes for a year.        
The decision seems to underscore AMC’s concern about losing its two original blockbuster dramas within a year of each other. The network shattered almost every television precedent by developing and showing two prominent and highly successful television dramas over the same time span. “Breaking Bad” is ending in two weeks in a flurry of rapturous praise. “Mad Men” was scheduled to conclude next spring.        
That would have left AMC with only “The Walking Dead” as a breakout hit. Its other current dramas, “Hell on Wheels” and this year’s “Low Winter Sun,” have not remotely approached the level of success that “Breaking Bad” or “Mad Men” did. AMC canceled “The Killing” (for a second time) earlier this month.        
So the network will now get two more chances, instead of one, to try to introduce new shows using “Mad Men” as a springboard. But in doing so, it will ask more patience from the show’s fans. The one benefit is the addition of one episode beyond what had been originally planned.        
In a statement, Mr. Weiner said, “We plan to take advantage of this chance to have a more elaborate story told in two parts, which can resonate a little bit longer in the minds of our audience.”

Take a gander at Twitter and initiate a search for Red Bulls Coach Mike Petke and you find pages like Mike Petke’s Sweater, Mike Petke’s Suit and Mike Petke (not official).        


The genuine article can only be found at @petkemike, though do not expect an effusive dissection of the Red Bulls’ latest game or strategy because the most recent entry is from Aug. 29, preceded by one from Aug. 6 (in which the coach wishes his wife a happy birthday).        
“The only social media I’m on is Twitter because Red Bull asked me to join a couple of years ago when I was still playing,” Petke said during his weekly telephone conference call. “I love it, but it’s been awhile since I’ve posted. But my phone beeps every time I’m mentioned on Twitter. I’m not really sure how to turn those things off.” He added: “I have a hands-on, interested, extended family and close friends and I get calls all the time telling me what was said online. I do go to take a look, but only to make sure my players are saying the right thing.”        
It is clear that Petke is more concerned with what his players do rather than what they say. The coach’s men have won three straight games in Major League Soccer and are alone in first place in the Eastern Conference with five regular-season matches left to play. In his rookie season as the team’s head coach, Petke acknowledged that the most difficult transition has been in dealing with player management, massaging egos and picking the right spots to speak to his players.        
“The league has changed, there are more teams, more players, more personalities,” he said. “And you also throw in all that social media stuff, the players are under a microscope and they are getting critiqued at all angles. It makes the players a little more touchy. They ask why they’re not starting because it’s all over Facebook, MLSsoccer.com and Twitter. It’s blowing up. I call it the LeBron Syndrome, after LeBron James. He came out of high school and was given a huge contract before anyone knew if he could play in the league. You look around our league and there are some who would rather that than to earn it, and when things don’t fall their way it’s a touchy situation. It’s just a different day and age.”        
That may sound like an older man speaking, though Petke is only 37, a young 37 at that.        
With two days off after Saturday’s 2-0 win over visiting Toronto, the Red Bulls (14-9-6, 48 points) are hoping for the return of at least some of the club’s injured players ahead of the Sunday evening match against visiting Dallas. Tim Cahill, who was on the bench last week but did not play, will again be available for action after dealing with a knee injury. Defender Brandon Barklage is again fit, but Roy Miller, Lloyd Sam and Connor Lade remain questionable.        
As the end of the regular season approaches, Petke said that he would like to settle on a starting lineup, though the situation is fluid and he is open to adjustment based on performance in games and training.        
“I will never compromise something for the sake of stability,” he said. “I’m not against a set lineup. If someone in a starting position is having a phenomenal week in training I’ll stick with him. If not, I’m not afraid to make changes.”

A corner of New York City, by Delancey and Essex Streets on the Lower East Side, has been a vacant, bitterly contested area for decades, as community groups and politicians battled to a standstill over what would replace tenements that were demolished in 1967.        


But after a three-year effort to forge a compromise, the Bloomberg administration plans to announce on Wednesday that it has selected developers to erect a complex called Essex Crossing at the location, long known as the Seward Park urban renewal area. The development would include retail markets, restaurants, office space, a movie theater, parks, an Andy Warhol Museum and 1,000 apartments. Half of the apartments would be for low-, moderate- and middle-income families.        
Designed by SHoP Architects and Beyer Blinder Belle, the glassy, six-acre complex would be built over the next decade by a consortium on nine city-owned lots in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood that was once home to working-class Italians, Jews, Puerto Ricans and Ukrainians.        
The redevelopment would tap into the past by giving priority to some of the 2,000, largely Puerto Rican families displaced four decades ago, and into the future by creating a neighborhood hub with badly needed housing, small-scale retail and office space for tech companies and budding entrepreneurs.        
“This project is the pinnacle of urban development in 2013,” Deputy Mayor Robert K. Steel said on Tuesday. “It has all the hallmarks of a Bloomberg administration project: transforming an underutilized asset into a place that serves the diverse needs of the community.”        
To reach this point, the administration engaged in an unprecedented collaboration with the local community board and a task force starting in 2008. If Essex Crossing is built, it would also represent the culmination of compromises by various factions in the neighborhood and by the city itself.        
Edward Delgado, who was a teenager in 1967 when his family was forced to relocate, said he had always wanted housing for families of limited and modest means built on the site. “We had to go along with 50 percent affordable and 50 percent market-rate,” he said, “or we would’ve had another 50 years of empty lots.”        
The developers selected for the project — L&M Development Partners, BFC Partners, Taconic Investment Partners and Grand Street Settlement — won out over some of the city’s most prominent builders. In return, the developers will pay the city $180 million and start the first building within 18 months.        
The announcement comes about three and a half months before Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is to leave office, and some critics argue that his successor could easily overturn this plan.        
“The new mayor is going to want to put his own stamp on the project,” said Harold Jacob, general manager of the East River Housing Corporation, which operates 1,675 cooperative apartments in the neighborhood. “I don’t believe the city produced a good plan.”        
But elected officials, developers and others say that for the first time in nearly half a century there is a consensus on what should happen. The plan has the support of Councilwoman Margaret S. Chin; State Senator Daniel L. Squadron; Community Board 3; and the State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who lives nearby and has blocked past proposals.        
The redevelopment of the area had eluded Mayors John V. Lindsay, Edward I. Koch and Rudolph W. Giuliani, as well as Mr. Bloomberg in 2003. The longstanding split in the community had some Latinos and housing advocates demanding that the city build only low-income housing on the site, while residents of the nearby co-ops countered that only commercial development was appropriate.        
“It was an exercise in frustration,” said Richard LeFrak, a developer who was twice selected to rebuild Seward Park but was unable to move forward. “You had the collision between the Jewish community in the Grant Houses and the Latino and Asian communities.”

PARIS — The Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, considered Europe’s top human rights award, has been bestowed on luminaries like Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Nelson Mandela. This year, in a slap against Washington, the award could go to Edward J. Snowden, known as either the N.S.A. whistle-blower or a traitor, depending on one’s perspective.        


The European Parliament, the European Union’s only directly elected body, nominated Mr. Snowden for the prize late Monday. The others in contention include Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani girl who was 14 when the Taliban shot her in October but survived to become a potent voice in the struggle for education rights for women; Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic who is imprisoned in Russia; and Erdem Gunduz, who helped inspire the mass protests against the Turkish government’s perceived authoritarianism this year in Istanbul’s Taksim Square.        
The nomination of Mr. Snowden is the latest in a series of rebukes from European lawmakers upset with the Obama administration’s foreign policies, including its surveillance program. More recently, the British Parliament refused to authorize the country’s participation in a military strike against Syria for a gas attack that killed more than 1,400 civilians. Only France, which does not require legislative approval of military actions, backed President Obama’s call to punish Syria for using chemical weapons.        
While hardly as momentous as the Syria vote, the nomination of Mr. Snowden carries great symbolic weight. It glaringly illustrates the chasm the leaks have opened between the United States and its allies, not only European countries but also Brazil, Mexico and other nations that have been spied on by the National Security Agency.        
In late June, after reports in Der Spiegel magazine that Washington was spying on the European Union and that the N.S.A. had tapped its offices in Washington, Brussels and the United Nations and gained access to internal computer networks, there was an angry outcry from European politicians.        
Mr. Snowden, 30, who has received temporary asylum in Russia, has been charged in the United States with espionage and theft, after his leaks of N.S.A. materials showing the extent of American spying at home and abroad. But the leftist and Green party members of the European Parliament who nominated him for the award praised him for his courage.        
Mr. Snowden “deserves to be honored for shedding light on the systematic infringements of civil liberties by U.S. and European secret services,” Daniel Cohn-Bendit of France and Rebecca Harms of Germany, the leaders of the Parliament’s Green members, said in a statement. “Snowden has risked his freedom to help us protect ours.”        
In an online New York Times opinion article  on Sunday, Peter Ludlow, a professor of philosophy at Northwestern University, wrote that Mr. Snowden had exposed a gap between members of the younger “WikiLeaks generation,” who regard him as a role model, and older commentators in the traditional news media, who believe he needs to be brought to justice. Mr. Ludlow cited a recent poll showing that 70 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34 believed that Mr. Snowden “did a good thing.”        
The winner of the prize will be announced in October, and the awards ceremony will be held in Strasbourg, France, in December. Last year, two convicted Iranians — Nasrin Sotoudeh, a lawyer who represents opposition activists and is now in prison, and Jafar Panahi, a filmmaker who has been released on bail but was banned from making films or leaving the country — were joint recipients of the prize.

The Fox News Channel on Tuesday announced a new lineup of hosts for its weeknight schedule, moving Greta Van Susteren to 7 p.m. from her current spot at 10 and moving Sean Hannity into the 10 p.m. hour from his present 9 o’clock slot.         
The 9 p.m. show is going, as previously reported, to Megyn Kelly, who is considered the fastest-rising new star at Fox News and is a centerpiece of the network’s plan to attract younger viewers. Bill O’Reilly will remain in the 8 p.m. slot with “The O’Reilly Factor.”        
The changes have been long in the planning and have attracted much speculation, especially about whether Mr. Hannity would slide to 7 p.m.        
Roger Ailes, the network’s founder and chairman, opened up the 7 p.m. hour by elevating his most prominent news anchor, Shepard Smith, to a new role that will bring him on throughout the evening with breaking news.        
In his announcement of the changes on Tuesday, Mr. Ailes said the success of Fox News had extended well beyond the traditional hours considered prime time, 8 to 11 p.m. He called that definition of prime time an “antiquated format.”        
Ms. Kelly’s new show will be called “The Kelly File” and will be live, with a concentration on breaking news. The new lineup will begin Oct. 7.

When considering backup power for mobile devices, consumers typically have two choices: a portable battery that can charge multiple devices or a charging case, which is more convenient but usually works with only a single device.         
Innovative Technology, a maker of gadget accessories, thinks consumers should have both. The company’s Justin Power Case, which is designed for the iPad, has a built-in battery that can charge the iPad and other gadgets, including iOS, Android and BlackBerry devices, at the same time.        
The company says the rechargeable battery in the Justin case can charge an iPad twice or an iPhone seven times on a single charge. That high-capacity battery makes the case ideal for travelers and others who use their devices for long periods.        
Charging is a little slow, however. It took me a few hours to fully charge my iPad, a bit longer than the process takes with a wall charger. Four tiny LEDs inside the cover let you know how much charge the case has left.        
The synthetic leather exterior of the Justin case is not particularly handsome, but it’s durable and offers good protection and a nice grip. The iPad slides easily into the case through an interior opening near the hinge, and a magnetic flap keeps it securely in place. An integrated kickstand can be used to prop up the iPad in portrait mode.        
The trade-off, however, is that the case is bulky, doubling the thickness of the iPad, even with the “ultra-slim” model. And the case does not activate iPad’s automatic shut-off when the cover is closed.        
The Justin case comes with a micro-USB cord and a wall adapter for charging, but not a cord with a 30-pin connector to attach to the iPad, which would have helped immensely. Still, at $70, the Justin case provides a long-lasting power backup at a decent price.

Thrust back into a central role in resolving the Syrian conflict, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council met on Tuesday to negotiate a draft resolution that would hold Syria to its pledge of identifying all chemical weapons under government control for destruction, but diplomats said major differences over a draft quickly emerged.        


The diplomats, who declined to be identified, said Russia, Syria’s most important ally, was resisting components of the draft, composed by the three Western permanent members — Britain, France and the United States — that discuss the threat of force to ensure Syrian compliance, whether to condemn the Syrian government for chemical weapons use and whether suspected users should be referred to the International Criminal Court for war crimes prosecutions.        
The discussions are unlikely to produce a quick resolution, the diplomats said, and it is unclear when a draft will be ready for a vote.        
Renewed momentum for Security Council action got a boost from a framework agreement reached on Saturday between the United States and Russia under which the council would review Syria’s compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, which the country officially agreed to join that same day.        
Under the framework agreement, the Syrians are expected to submit by Saturday a “comprehensive listing” of all their chemical weapons supplies and facilities as a first step, with the goal of identifying and destroying the munitions by the middle of 2014. The agreement also specified that the Security Council should review Syrian compliance with the rules of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, The Hague-based group that administers the treaty.        
Representatives of the council’s permanent members met a day after a United Nations panel of weapons inspectors confirmed that a devastating chemical weapons attack had been carried out near Damascus, the Syrian capital, on Aug. 21. Their report, the first independent on-the-ground inquest into that attack, did not ascribe blame. But nonproliferation experts said the litany of specific evidence presented appeared to implicate the government of President Bashar al-Assad.        
The Syrian government has said insurgents carried out the attack, in which hundreds of civilians were killed by exposure to sarin, a chemical nerve agent. Russia has supported the Syrian government’s assertion, arguing that it is illogical that Syrian forces could have been responsible.        
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who called the report a chilling document that described a war crime, declined at a United Nations news conference on Tuesday to ascribe responsibility for that attack, a position he has consistently held.        
But Mr. Ban expressed hope that the Russia-United States agreement reached Saturday, negotiated by Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia and Secretary of State John Kerry, had set in motion a diplomatic process that would overcome the divisions that have deadlocked the Security Council over Syria since the conflict there began 30 months ago.        
“What is encouraging is that the two foreign ministers agreed on a framework agreement, how to deal with all these chemical weapons,” Mr. Ban said. “I hope that spirit of very friendly negotiations, on the basis of good rapport, will help forge a unity among the Security Council.”        
He also expressed hope that any Security Council resolution on Syria “can really be an enforceable one.”        
The Russia-United States agreement specifies that if Syria fails to comply with its obligations under the chemical weapons treaty, the Security Council should impose measures under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, which allows for coercive steps, including the use of military force.        
But differing interpretations of that passage have emerged among the permanent members of the Security Council over the past few days.        
Diplomats said Russia wanted Chapter 7 mentioned as one of the options available to the council at a future date — opening the possibility that a further resolution would be needed if Syrian noncompliance became an issue. Britain, France and the United States, on the other hand, want the resolution language to convey the threat of Chapter 7 action immediately, in keeping with their publicly stated position that Syria cannot delay or dodge its obligations.        
France and the United States have also said they reserve the right to punish Syria militarily, a position criticized by Russia as illegal under the United Nations Charter.        
The United States ambassador, Samantha Power, on Tuesday invoked the details provided in the chemical weapons report to press the argument that accountability and enforceability must be part of any Security Council resolution on Syria growing out of the Aug. 21 attack, the deadliest use of chemical weapons since Saddam Hussein’s forces gassed the Kurdish village of Halabja in 1988.        
“For a crime of this magnitude, it is not enough to say ‘chemical weapons were used,’ any more than it would have been enough to say that ‘machetes were used’ in Rwanda in 1994,” she said in remarks to a General Assembly session on the chemical weapons report. “We must condemn the user, and here we must acknowledge what the technical details of the U.N. report make clear: only the regime could have carried out this large-scale chemical weapons attack, the largest attack in 25 years.”        
The differing views were reflected earlier Tuesday in a Moscow meeting between Mr. Lavrov and France’s foreign minister, Laurent Fabius. Mr. Lavrov was quoted as saying the agreement with the United States had made clear that if Syria is noncompliant, “then the Security Council will examine the situation.”        
Mr. Lavrov also disputed the conclusions drawn by his Western colleagues from the chemical weapons report. While Mr. Fabius said at a news conference that the report “exposes the regime,” Mr. Lavrov said his government had “serious reason to suggest that this was a provocation” carried out by insurgents seeking Mr. Assad’s demise.

When Bose decided to build a pair of in-ear headphones with a noise-canceling feature, it faced a quandary: how to stuff that technology into a tiny package.         
So Bose wisely decided to add an in-line control module at the base of the cord for its QuietComfort 20, the in-ear option in the company’s line of noise-canceling headphones. With this design, the module does not weigh down the cord or tug at your ears; you can easily slip it into a pocket with your music player.        
The noise-canceling feature works remarkably well. Two tiny microphones in each ear bud send signals to the control module, which responds instantly to counter unwanted sounds. Bose says the reaction time is less than a millisecond. The effect enriches your listening experience, making your music sound fuller and deeper. I tried the headphones on a variety of pop, rock and classical albums, and the music was consistently clean and free of distortion.        
Even with the noise-canceling feature turned on, a small amount of sound still slips in, typically the voices of other people, but this is common with noise-canceling headphones. The noise can be reduced by readjusting the ear buds to create more of a seal in the ear. Several soft, comfortable ear tips, which include stabilizers that help secure the tips, are included.        
The headphones come with a cloth carrying pouch and a mini-USB cable for charging. Bose says the battery in the control module lasts about 16 hours on a full charge. And, unlike some other noise-cancelling headphones, these still work when the control module is turned off or the battery runs out.        
Another nifty feature is something Bose calls the “aware” mode, because it lets more outside sound in, allowing you to be more aware of your surroundings. This means you can chat with the barista at your favorite coffee shop without removing your headphones. It also helps when walking around the streets of New York; ignorance is bliss, but not if you get hit by a taxi.        
The in-line remote control in the yoke of the cord includes a microphone for phone calls; a clip allows you to fasten the cord to a collar or lapel. A second model, the Bose QC20i, has an in-line remote intended for Apple iOS devices.        
All these features don’t come cheap; the QuietComfort 20 headphones cost $300. But you would be hard-pressed to find better noise-canceling technology.        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 18, 2013An earlier version of this article described incorrectly a feature of the headphones. While the headphones still work (without noise-cancelling) when the control module is turned off or the battery runs out, that is not what Bose calls the “aware” mode. In aware mode, which is activated by pushing a button on the midcord remote, some sound is allowed to bypass the noise-cancelling circuitry.

The Restaurant Takeaway column is devoted to restaurant dishes you can make in your own kitchen, tested and tweaked for home cooks. 


There’s the usual eggplant Parmesan sandwich and then there’s Frankies Spuntino’s fried eggplant sandwich. And for all the similarities of content and form, the two are leagues apart.        
That’s because the version at Frankies Spuntino (so named for owners Frank Falcinelli and Frank Castronovo) is based on their grandmothers’ recipes brought over from Italy. It is a sandwich that’s crisp and tender, lightly oily in a good way, and filled with salty pungent flavor from a combination of pecorino cheese and Parmigiano-Reggiano that adds intensity without the gloppy factor of melted mozzarella.        
The secret is in its technique. The eggplant is cooked three times to render it as tender as silk, offering absolutely no resistance to the tooth, and topped with sweet, garlicky tomato sauce. Then airy, crusty ciabatta is toasted until quite crisp. This gives a textural contrast and keeps the whole sandwich firmly together — though if you’re not careful the sauce will drip down your chin and possibly all over your shirt (keep a napkin close by).        
Given that the recipe involves a double frying and then baking, it’s not a sandwich to make on a whim. But if you plan ahead, you’ll be in for a feast (make the eggplant up to five days ahead and reheat just before serving).        
After all, how can you doubt not one but two Italian grandmothers?        
Frankies Spuntino’s Fried Eggplant Sandwich 
Time: 3 hours 20 minutes 
Yield: 6 servings 
1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil        
6 garlic cloves, peeled        
Pinch red chile flakes        
2 (28-ounce) cans whole, peeled tomatoes        
1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt, more as needed        
5 small Italian eggplants (2 pounds)        
4 large eggs        
6 tablespoons ground Parmigiano-Reggiano, more as needed        
6 tablespoons ground pecorino Romano, more as needed        
1 very large or 2 medium ciabatta loaves, for serving        
1. In a large deep saucepan over medium low heat, combine 1/4 cup oil and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in chile flakes; cook 30 seconds.        
2. While garlic cooks, place tomatoes and juices in a large bowl and crush with clean hands. Remove tomatoes’ firm stem ends and any basil leaves packed into the can. Stir crushed tomatoes and salt into pot. Simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, until tomatoes and garlic have completely broken down and sauce is thick, about 2 hours. Cool.        
3. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment or paper towels. Trim stem end from eggplants; peel and discard skin. Using a knife or a Japanese mandolin, slice lengthwise into 3/16-inch-thick slabs. Arrange eggplant in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle both sides of eggplant slices with salt. Let stand 10 minutes. Pat eggplant dry with paper towels.        
4. Line another rimmed baking sheet with paper towel and place a wire rack on top. In a large, deep skillet, heat 1/2 cup oil until a drop of water flicked into pan sizzles. Working in batches, fry eggplant until just tender, 20 to 30 seconds per side. Transfer fried eggplant to rack to drain. Remove skillet from heat.        
5. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, 2 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano and 2 tablespoons pecorino. Add 3/4 cup oil to the skillet and return to medium-high heat until oil is sizzling.        
6. Working in batches, dip drained eggplant into egg batter; fry in oil until lightly golden and cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes per batch. You will know oil is hot enough if batter puffs and sticks to eggplant on contact with oil. If it falls off, the oil isn’t hot enough.        
7. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1/2 cup tomato sauce in the bottom of a 9-inch square baking pan. Arrange eggplant over the bottom of pan in a tight, even layer. Top with 1/3 of the remaining combined cheeses. Repeat layer of sauce, eggplant and 1/3 of cheese. Finish with a final layer of sauce and cheese (reserve any remaining sauce for serving). Transfer pan to oven and bake until cheese is melted and golden, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven; Spoon additional sauce over top, and garnish with additional cheese. Cool for at least 20 minutes.        
8. Cut eggplant into six equal pieces. Cut ciabatta into six pieces equal to the size of the eggplant servings. Split each portion of the ciabatta horizontally and toast. Sandwich eggplant portions between bread and serve.

Nancy Gibbs, 53, was named the new managing editor of Time magazine on Tuesday, the first woman to become the top editor at the newsweekly in its 90-year history.        


Ms. Gibbs, who started at Time as a fact-checker 28 years ago, succeeds Richard Stengel, who is leaving to work for the State Department after seven years in the job. She was most recently Mr. Stengel’s deputy.        
Ms. Gibbs said that while she had filled in on occasion for Mr. Stengel, she officially started overseeing Time’s covers with the Aug. 5 issue. In addition to writing more cover stories for Time than any other writer in the magazine’s history, Ms. Gibbs is a prolific author whose most recent book, “The President’s Club: Inside the World’s Most Exclusive Fraternity,” was published last year.        
Ms. Gibbs said in a phone interview that she expected her writing skills would help Time Inc. tell stories across all media, including online and through video. While Time has experienced a decline in newsstand sales of about 39 percent over the last five years, it has held onto its total circulation of about 3.3 million subscribers and newsstand buyers, according to data from the Alliance for Audited Media.        
Its digital presence is also growing through its 4.9 million followers on Twitter.        
“I think I am the first editor to take over when our digital audience is bigger than our print audience,” Ms. Gibbs said. “My role is going to be more widely spread than past editors’ — on what we are thinking about what we are doing online, what we are doing with tablet, what we are doing with print.”        
Ms. Gibbs added that she had been surprised at how many young women at Time said they were excited about her promotion, even at a time when breaking “this glass ceiling has become so commonplace.” In January, Time Inc. named Martha Nelson editor in chief of its magazine division, the first woman to hold that job.        
Ms. Gibbs said that these moves seemed to have resonated with employees. “This is a historic institution and there is something that excites people about seeing a woman run it for the first time,” she said.        
Ms. Gibbs is taking over a title that continues to generate revenue for the Time Inc. empire. According to data tracked by the magazine consultant John Harrington, the title’s projected advertising and circulation revenues were $497 million in 2012.

JERUSALEM — Israeli lawmakers grappled on Tuesday with new questions of how to deal with the tens of thousands of migrants from Africa who have entered the country illegally, now that Israel’s Supreme Court has overturned a law allowing the government to detain migrants and asylum seekers for up to three years without trial.        


A panel of nine justices ruled on Monday that the law, which came into effect in June 2012, violated Israel’s Basic Laws on human dignity and freedom. The court ordered the government to examine every detainee’s case within 90 days and to release any who are not the subject of deportation proceedings.        
About 60,000 Africans have entered Israel since 2005, a vast majority of them from Sudan or Eritrea. The government said more than a year ago that it would step up efforts to deter, detain and deport the migrants, as residents mounted protests in areas where the new arrivals were concentrated, like south Tel Aviv.        
About 2,000 African men, women and children are in detention facilities in the desert near the Egyptian border.        
The court decision has reignited an emotional public debate about the fate of the migrants. The government says that while some of them are genuine refugees from war-torn areas, most are really economic migrants seeking work. Government ministers have argued that the migrants threaten the Jewish character of Israel.        
Sudanese and Eritreans are afforded blanket protection in Israel and cannot be deported, in line with international conventions. But the Israeli government has been working on plans to have them leave voluntarily, either to return to their countries of origin or to resettle in other countries. Human rights activists say that repatriation is not voluntary when the alternative is spending three years in jail.        
Applications for refugee status have piled up, and few have been approved. Oded Feller, a lawyer for the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, said that 90 percent of the Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers had not yet been checked to see if they qualified, and that Israel had little interest in hurrying the process.        
Among other measures meant to block the human flow, Israel has almost completed construction of a steel fence along its border with Egypt, a project that took on added urgency as the security situation in the Sinai Peninsula deteriorated. Government figures say that only 34 illegal migrants, known here by the Hebrew word for infiltrators, crossed that border in the first half of 2013, all of whom were detained. In the same period of 2012, 9,570 people crossed.        



 



"
Metro,"










A New York City subway ride remains, for many, an exercise in gaze aversion. Maps are inspected. Advertisements are read in their entirety. A staring contest with an empty seat can prove preferable to even the briefest human interaction.        


And now, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is churning toward a future where travelers will never again be disconnected from their cellphones while onboard.        
At a forum on Tuesday, the authority’s chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, said that transit officials hoped to add Wi-Fi and possibly cellphone reception aboard moving trains — in what appeared to be the first public acknowledgment that the authority’s ambitions for wireless service went beyond stations.        
Mr. Prendergast said the push for expanded Wi-Fi and cellphone access was a reaction, in part, to the demands of the growing population of young riders.        
“It is one of the features that the X’ers and the Y’ers and the millennials consider an expectation or an entitlement, not a luxury,” Mr. Prendergast said at the gathering, which was hosted by the Citizens Budget Commission.        
There is no timeline for a plan, and it is unclear how the project would be financed — or even if the service would be free.        
Wi-Fi and cellphone service are already available at dozens of underground stations in Manhattan, including Times Square, Rockefeller Center and Columbus Circle. That program, with a planned systemwide expansion, is being paid for by Transit Wireless, at an estimated cost of up to $200 million. The company and the transportation authority have agreed to split the revenues from fees paid by wireless carriers and other sublicensees.        
The authority is also seeking to install Wi-Fi on the Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road, issuing a request for proposals for a firm to provide service both on trains and inside stations. A spokesman said the authority was currently negotiating with a potential vendor.        
Service aboard subway trains was a logical evolution, Mr. Prendergast suggested.        
“Every time you provide Wi-Fi to a greater degree, they want to go to the next level,” he said. “That would be the next frontier. Exactly when, can’t say.”        
Though many riders already play games on their phones while onboard, the prospect of overly loud phone calls is another matter. Long confined to the elevated lines, where riders’ thoughts on friends and co-workers often become topics for public consumption, the ability to chat could be a mixed blessing underground.        
The authority has often framed the expansion of wireless access as a safety issue, and some riders agreed that communicating in an emergency was a top concern.        
Others have worried, though, about infringements of subway etiquette. Will signs be posted, or announcements recited, to remind riders to be considerate while talking on their phones? Will the authority have to set aside quiet cars?        
Kyle Henry, 27, from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, wondered if a time-tested excuse for hanging up the phone could be imperiled.        
“You never know if someone is really getting on the train,” he said while waiting for a No. 1 train on Tuesday. “It’s become such an out.”        
Mr. Prendergast also cautioned against the pitfalls of never-ending phone service. He recalled a recent commute on Metro-North: A fellow passenger remained glued to his electronic reader, even after leaving the train at Grand Central Terminal.        
“Any of you remember Mr. Magoo?” Mr. Prendergast said. “You know, people were bouncing off him as he’s walking around.”        
After watching him descend the stairs to the Lexington Avenue line, as “people are falling and tripping” in his wake, Mr. Prendergast said, he asked the man to put his device away.        
“I’m all for connectivity,” Mr. Prendergast told the crowd on Tuesday. “To a limit.”

Headliner  


ILILI BOX 
When he moved to New York nearly 20 years ago, Philippe Massoud, the Lebanese chef, thought about opening a Middle Eastern fast-food joint. He’s finally getting around to it, serving takeout in a repurposed shipping container just outside Madison Square Park. As he does at Ilili, his grand restaurant gleaming with copper and cedar a couple of blocks away, he will put his personal spin on the cuisine of his heritage. “You can see that for a long time I have wanted to do sandwiches and other grab-and-go foods,” he said. There will be traditional falafel and Korean and Mexican styles, as well as pressed chicken sandwiches, duck shawarma with garlic-fig sauce, lamb “pastrami,” manouche (pita baked with zaatar spices), and seared brussels sprouts with mint yogurt and fig sauce, a dish for which Ilili has become known. The stand will serve beer and wine on tap, and green lemonade with mint. There are tables nearby. (Opens Wednesday): Fifth Avenue and 24th Street, (646) 771-4090. ililibox.com. 
Opening 
MARCO’S Andrew Feinberg and Francine Stephens have turned the old Franny’s location into this trattoria-style restaurant. Danny Amend, the chef, tends the wood grill and rotisserie for dishes like grilled oysters, spit-roasted pork loin and chicken cacciatore. (Monday): 295 Flatbush Avenue (Prospect Place), Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0427, marcosbrooklyn.com. 
Reopening 
DB BISTRO MODERNE In more than a month of renovations, the sea foam tones of Daniel Boulud’s theater district bistro have been replaced with deeper, more contrasting colors; the bar has been moved to the front dining room; and gray leather booths have been added in the center, formerly the bar. The chef is now Jim Burke, who was at Caffè Storico. (Saturday): 55 West 44th Street, (212) 391-2400, dbbistro.com. 
Looking Ahead 
RAINBOW ROOM The landmark restaurant on the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which closed in 2009, will reopen in the fall of 2014, and the famous dance floor will revolve again. Tishman Speyer, which runs Rockefeller Center, has announced plans to open it to the public and for catered events. It plans to run the restaurant and has hired Gabellini Sheppard Architects to design it and Blau & Associates of Las Vegas to oversee its development.        
CHEFS CLUB BY FOOD & WINE The Puck Building will be the New York home of the Chefs Club, a restaurant that started at the St. Regis in Aspen, Colo., last year. Like the Aspen template, it will be a collaboration between Food & Wine magazine and Stephane De Baets, a money manager who represents the owner of the hotel, and will feature visiting chefs. It is to open in the spring: 275 Mulberry Street (Jersey Street).

Business,"










The network television season got off to an early and swinging start on Monday thanks to the ax wielded by the Headless Horseman on the Fox network.         
The Fox drama “Sleepy Hollow” burst out to one of the strongest recent ratings for any new series, proving both the value of jumping ahead of the pack for a fall premiere and of promoting a new show effectively through sports, among other programming.        
At the same time, ABC’s reality war horse, “Dancing With the Stars,” showed some new life thanks to an intriguing lineup of celebrity dancers, and CBS’s summer drama hit, “Under the Dome,” finished its first season in strong fashion.        
But the big ratings story Monday was “Sleepy Hollow,” a show that was announced without much fanfare last spring. The series garnered many good reviews and strong word of mouth for its far-out premise, which involves the reincarnation of Ichabod Crane and the Horseman, some Revolutionary War mythology and even biblical references like the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse.        
In its initial outing, “Hollow” pulled 10.1 million viewers with an excellent 3.5 rating among the viewers Fox sells to advertisers, those between the ages of 18 and 49. That was the best number of the night (aside from “Monday Night Football” on cable).        
It was a spectacular improvement for Fox over the disastrous results it scored last fall on Monday nights at 9, with a show called “The Mob Doctor.”        
Some of the competition was weaker than what “Hollow” will ultimately face, especially “The Voice” on NBC, and CBS’s comedy lineup, which both start next Monday. But ABC did have the latest edition of “Dancing,” featuring some celebrities of high interest, including the actress Valerie Harper, defying her cancer prognosis, and Nicole Polizzi (Snooki) of “Jersey Shore” fame, back down to her playing weight.        
“Dancing” attracted a huge audience of 16.2 million. But the series always has had big total viewer numbers because of its loyal following among older women. This edition also scored a respectable 3.2 rating in the 18-49 group. (One caveat: Some portion of the number may be inflated because ABC’s station in Pittsburgh was carrying the Steelers, who were playing on “Monday Night Football.”)        
As for “Under the Dome,” the series was consistent all summer, winning its time period most Mondays. The finale averaged about 12 million viewers and a solid 2.8 rating in the 18-49 group. Both numbers are exceptional for a summer series, and CBS, of course, is bringing the show back next June.

What a cad I used to be, constantly ditching the bistro that had opened only four months ago for the week-old trattoria with an even dewier complexion, callously trading in the yellowtail sashimi that had been so good to me for a hot tamale of unproven charms.        


Then, a few years back, the restaurant Barbuto and I settled down.        
It’s bliss. She knows my heart, knows my drill: a gin martini to begin, a seasonal salad for my appetizer, the roasted chicken after.        
And I know her. If the weather’s nice, a breeze will blow in from the West Village streets that her retractable walls open onto. The kale that she serves me will be sparingly dressed. And the breast meat? As plump and tender as it was the last time around and the dozen times before that.        
We don’t have fireworks, not this late in the game. But we have a rhythm. Sometimes that’s better.        
What I’m saying is that I’m a regular there, as I am at the Breslin, whose lamb burger is as true to me as I am to it; at Empellón Taqueria, where I never stray from the fish tempura tacos, which never let me down; at Szechuan Gourmet, where I don’t glance at a menu. I don’t have to.        
I’m no monogamist, that’s clear. More of a polygamist, but I dote on my sister wives. I’ve come to see that the broccolini isn’t always greener on the other side of Houston Street, and I’m here to sing what’s too seldom sung: the joys of familiarity. The pleasures of intimacy. The virtues of staying put.        
What you have with a restaurant that you visit once or twice is a transaction. What you have with a restaurant that you visit over and over is a relationship.        
The fashionable script for today’s food maven doesn’t encourage that sort of bonding, especially not in a city with New York’s ambition and inexhaustible variety. Here you’re supposed to dash to the new Andrew Carmellini brasserie before anybody else gets there; be the first to taste ABC Cocina’s guacamole; advertise an opinion about the Massaman curry at Uncle Boons while others are still puzzling over the fugitive apostrophe. Snap a photo. Tweet it. Then move on. There’s always something else. Always virgin ground.        
For years, I was dedicated to exploring it, by dint of my duty as The Times’s restaurant critic. I was a paid philanderer. It was exhilarating. It was exhausting.        
And it wasn’t necessarily the best course. I’d think back to my pre-critic days, in Rome, and to the handful of restaurants I kept circling around to. The servers and owners there would exult when I walked through the door, because they understood how to make me happy and they could have a conversation with me different from the ones they had with newcomers, a conversation built on shared history and reciprocal trust, a dialogue between honest-to-goodness friends. I wasn’t special. But I was special to them.        
I’d think, too, of my food-loving father’s approach to dining out. When he found a place with a few dishes and a few servers he adored, and when those servers reciprocated his affection, he stopped looking around. Called off the search. He understood what I’ve relearned these last few years, with Barbuto and the others: the smiles you get from hosts, hostesses and bartenders who know you are entirely unlike the smiles from ones who are just meeting you. They’re less theatrical, less stilted, warmer by countless degrees.        
Regulars matter to a restaurant. Though the newcomers drawn there by reviews or Yelp chatter can keep it packed for a while, the familiar faces help it go the distance. That’s why some of those fusty, pricey Italian haunts on the Upper East Side outlast the trend-conscious efforts of this “Top Chef” alumnus or that darling of the culinary scribes. They’ve put extra energy into cultivating a steady clientele, turning themselves into clubs, into tribes.        
“It’s the only way to do it,” said Robert Bohr, one of the owners of the new restaurant Charlie Bird, in SoHo, which is designed, as are Barbuto and so many other restaurants in that general area of downtown Manhattan, to be a repeat refuge for neighborhood folks who like to drop in impulsively. A few tables are informally tagged for such “walk-ins,” as they’re called in the business, and the menu accommodates snacking as well as feasting.        
Mr. Bohr said that he had worked at what he called “destination restaurants,” and that while first- and second-timers might keep them humming at peak hours during peak stretches, “it’s regulars who support you on off days, in bad weather, during times of the night that aren’t prime times.”        
In return, regulars at most restaurants get extra consideration: a glass of sparkling wine that wasn’t asked for, a dessert that just appears, a promotion to the head of the waiting list when the place is full. There’s a practical, unemotional reason to join the frequent-flier club. Perks accrue.        
Mr. Bohr noted that you can make requests of a restaurant where you’re a regular that you’d never make — and that might not be indulged — elsewhere. Because he has lunch as often as once a week at ABC Kitchen, he can place his order the second he sits down and say, “I want to be out in 25 minutes.”        
“They’re welcoming to that,” he said, because he’s been loyal and he’ll be back.

AHMEDABAD, India — India’s most important election in a generation began in earnest this month the same way consequential elections nearly always start here — with a proclamation and a deadly riot.        


In New Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party announced last week that it had chosen Narendra Modi, one of the most divisive politicians in India’s history, as its candidate for prime minister in next spring’s national elections. Mr. Modi, the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat, is an unapologetic Hindu chauvinist who has been accused of mass murder.        
Mr. Modi has tempered his anti-Muslim tirades and replaced them with a message of development based on a record in Gujarat that even critics acknowledge is impressive. But critics also say he and his Hindu nationalist party have benefited from past violence between Hindus and Muslims, using it to paper over Hindus’ historic differences over caste and get them to vote as a bloc along religious lines.        
Not coincidentally, mass rioting broke out last week in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous and politically important state, after a legislator from Mr. Modi’s party circulated a fake video of two Hindus being lynched by a Muslim mob. Forty-four people were killed and 42,000 were displaced as villages were sacked.        
Riyazat Ali of Bawari said he watched from a hidden room as a Hindu mob stormed his house, hacked his brother to death and fatally shot his 18-year-old niece.        
“I saw everything,” said Mr. Ali, who has been living in a refugee camp in Kandhla for the past week with his 11 children. “It was raining bullets inside the house.”        
India may be the world’s most populous democracy, but election campaigns here are often fueled by hate and soaked in blood. By choosing Mr. Modi, a fiery orator who once peppered his speeches with anti-Muslim slurs, the Bharatiya Janata Party has raised the prospect that this election could be the deadliest in decades.        
Hindus make up roughly 80 percent of India’s population and Muslims 13 percent, a share about equal to that of blacks in the United States. Sushil Kumar Shinde, India’s minister of Home Affairs, said that there had already been 451 cases of sectarian violence this year, surpassing last year’s total of 410. He warned that violence was likely to intensify as elections approached.        
Among the country’s vast urban youth, Mr. Modi has rock-star appeal. Half of India’s population is under 25, and most have seen little more from their leaders than the soporific near-whispers of octogenarians like Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. By contrast, Mr. Modi is a charismatic preacher of a resurgent India, a vision that millions mired in a sputtering economy find intoxicating. To many Hindus, he is a revelation.        
To many Muslims, though, he is an abomination. In 2002, less than a year after he was appointed the state’s chief minister, riots swept Gujarat and killed more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Mothers were skewered, children set afire and fathers hacked to pieces.        
Some witnesses claimed that Mr. Modi encouraged the violence, which he has denied. He has never been charged, but close associates of his were convicted of inciting a riot.        
“They want to create a Hindu voting bloc that transcends caste, and they’ll use hate to do it,” said Sumant Banerjee, a fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study in Shimla.        
The riots only bolstered Mr. Modi’s political standing. Months later, having consolidated the Hindu vote, he led his party to a resounding victory in state elections. Since then he has dominated Gujarat’s politics, the state’s largest city, Ahmedabad, remains deeply segregated and most of India’s Muslims hate him.        
Mr. Modi, 63, refused requests over months for an interview (he rarely speaks to Western news organizations). Jay Narayan Vyas, a leader of Mr. Modi’s opposition party, said that Mr. Modi was not to blame for the 2002 riots and that his party did not demonize Muslims.        
“The B.J.P. philosophy is justice to all but appeasement to none,” he said.        
Mr. Vyas said that as prime minister, Mr. Modi would bring wealth to India and tame its political chaos. He said India needed a strong leader who “doesn’t allow democracy to be a passport to misbehave.”

MUMBAI, India — Bangladesh’s Supreme Court on Tuesday condemned a senior Islamist leader, Abdul Quader Mollah, to death by hanging — increasing his punishment for a mass murder conviction from the life sentence he received from a special tribunal in February, and sparking demonstrations.        


The announcement prompted Islamist protesters to march in the capital, Dhaka, and to set off crude bombs and burn vehicles in the port city of Chittagong. About 30 people were injured in clashes, including some police officers, the authorities said.        
Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist opposition party, called for a 48-hour nationwide strike starting on Wednesday to protest the sentence.        
Others hailed the new sentence handed down to Mr. Mollah, who was convicted on charges of committing atrocities during the country’s 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.        
“The nation’s demands have been met and the stigma washed away through the verdict,” said the country’s attorney general, Mahbubey Alam.        
Bangladesh has been prosecuting defendants accused of committing atrocities during the war for more than two years, and each turn in the major cases has sparked protests. When Mr. Mollah was sentenced on Feb. 5 to life in prison, thousands of secularists protested, complaining that the sentence was too lenient, and demanding a change in the law so that it could be appealed. Over the next month, scores were killed in clashes between protesters and security forces.        
Mr. Mollah’s defense lawyer, Abdur Razzaq, on Tuesday denounced the decision to increase the sentence to death as unjust and wrong. He said the step by the Supreme Court had no precedent in Bangladesh.        
The court’s announcement sets the stage for a potentially violent election season, with opinion polls currently giving an edge to the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which is allied with Jamaat. Jamaat is barred from participating in the election by a Supreme Court ruling this summer that it was not legally registered.        
An estimated three million people were killed and thousands of women were raped during the 1971 war, when Bangladesh, a largely Muslim country with roughly 160 million people, broke away from Pakistan. Jamaat-e-Islami opposed independence during the war, but its leaders have denied committing atrocities against their countrymen.        
The turmoil surrounding the country’s war-crimes tribunal points to unresolved tensions over the conflict. Human Rights Watch, an international group, criticized the tribunals, saying that cases were based on scant evidence and that judges colluded with prosecutors, leading to the “conclusion that there has been strong judicial bias towards the prosecution.”

                            “I’m tired of being funny,” says Eva, the Los Angeles massage therapist whose midlife travails are the subject of “Enough Said,” a small miracle of a movie written and directed by Nicole Holofcener. It is possible to sympathize with Eva and also to marvel at her curious sense of timing. Happily — or at least not miserably — divorced, with nice friends and a gratifyingly nondysfunctional teenage daughter, Eva, played by the reliably hilarious Julia Louis-Dreyfus, uses her sense of humor as a social tool and an emotional defense. She’s a good sport, a designated joker, which is fine except that it means that she never has to be taken seriously, even by herself.        


                            But as she rolls over in the bed she has just shared, for the first time, with Albert (James Gandolfini) — also the divorced parent of a girl soon to leave for college — Eva senses another possibility. This guy, whom she met at a party and recently started dating, might actually get her, not just her jokes. He agreeably and gallantly says that he’s also tired of being funny. “But you’re not funny,” she says as they snuggle against each other, laughing at her own quick wit and also paying him a sincere, if somewhat backhanded, compliment.        

                            Now is the time to state that “Enough Said” is very funny indeed. Line for line, scene for scene, it is one of the best-written American film comedies in recent memory and an implicit rebuke to the raunchy, sloppy spectacles of immaturity that have dominated the genre in recent years.        

                            This is not to say that Ms. Holofcener, an acute observer of the manners and morals of the self-satisfied metropolitan middle class, West Coast division, is decorous or genteel. She is, rather, almost ruthless in her attention to the petty vanities and hypocrisies of her characters, and the ways their relatively privileged circumstances lead them to weave webs of guilt, complacency and stifled aggression.        

                            And yet it is also clear that Ms. Holofcener likes them, even — or especially — when they are ridiculous, myopic or mean. This has been apparent in all of her features so far, from “Walking and Talking” (1996) through “Lovely and Amazing” (2002), “Friends With Money” (2006) and “Please Give” (2010). Their only real flaw is scarcity. Ideally, Ms. Holofcener would be able to work at a Woody Allen pace, issuing annual bulletins from the lives of people who, after 15 or 20 minutes, already seem like your friends.        

                            In other words, they are exasperating and difficult as well as lovable. Ms. Louis-Dreyfus was memorably described (in her “Seinfeld” persona) as a pretty woman with “a face like a frying pan.” That face has matured into a remarkably expressive instrument. Eva is like no other movie character I have ever seen, and uncannily like a lot of real women I know. Motherhood on the big screen is typically viewed with pity, sentimentality or resentment, and romantic love tends to be treated in a similarly reductive manner, as an impossible dream or a state of earthly bliss. Ms. Louis-Dreyfus and Ms. Holofcener know better, and they approach Eva’s emotional adventures, as mother, lover and friend, as a series of practical and ethical challenges.        

                            Her relationships with Albert and with her daughter, Ellen (the wonderfully sensitive Tracey Fairaway), are each complicated by a third person, whose presence at first seems benign or irrelevant. Eva’s closeness to Ellen’s needy best friend, Chloe (Tavi Gevinson), provokes some jealousy as Ellen prepares to leave home. Meanwhile, she has acquired a new client and friend: Marianne (Catherine Keener), a poet with exquisite taste and an aura of high bohemian glamour who happens to be Albert’s former wife.        

                            The real genius of “Enough Said” is that it takes this entirely plausible anecdotal circumstance and unlocks both its farcical potential and its latent profundity. What happens when the things that you once found charming start driving you crazy? Many love stories address that question, but Ms. Holofcener tilts it a few degrees. Does it matter that the things about Albert that Eva finds charming drive Marianne crazy? Should it?

If you wanted to take the measure of Ignacio Mattos’s cooking at Estela, which opened on East Houston Street in June, you might look at the burrata on the menu and think: no, too easy. Anyone can slap burrata on a plate and wait for the moaning to start. But order it anyway, so you can see what happens when Mr. Mattos puts this louche, voluptuous cheese on a juice cleanse.        


The burrata sits like whipped cream on charred bread. Soaking into the bread and pooling around it is a brooding green liquid pressed from lovage, sorrel, celery and other foliage. It looks like something you would force yourself to drink after doing very bad things to your body. Ingesting it with burrata must be some kind of preventive medicine, the after-midnight ibuprofen with a bourbon chaser.        
That’s not what it feels like, though. When this fatty sprawl of dairy is brought to heel with fresh and grassy vegetable juice, it becomes something you taste, not something that washes over you in a big creamy wave. It’s strange but it’s right.        
Strange food is often born from a need to kill boredom, ours or the cook’s. It can keep kitchen and dining room awake through what would otherwise be another night of spaghetti and salad.        
Mr. Mattos’s cooking at Estela has a mild case of weirdness. It is just unfamiliar enough that I had eaten about a meal and a half there before it dawned on me that nearly everything is Mediterranean, more or less. I should have seen that one coming, given that Mr. Mattos, who grew up in Uruguay, cooked at Chez Panisse for a year and Il Buco for five.        
The cooking is almost familiar, but not quite, and it’s the little differences that get under your skin. The flatbread served with an excellent potato-thickened mash of salt cod is a rye matzo. And a whole squid and a spring onion, both griddled on a plancha and served with a reasonably traditional Romesco of red peppers and hazelnuts, look like a leathery, podlike alien creature alongside a blackened stem that snakes down the plate. The mild strangeness drew my attention to how deep and elemental the flavors of both dishes were.        
Mild strangeness hasn’t always been Mr. Mattos’s preferred line of attack. When he was the chef at Isa, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, he reveled in deep, surrealist weirdness. His best-known dish there was fried sardine skeleton, which looked as if it belonged behind glass at a museum of natural oddities. I remember rattling my jaw on nearly raw grains and getting my first taste of sweet potato leaves, which until then I had thought were poisonous.        
Estela, which Mr. Mattos opened with two partners, Mark Connell and a wine-guy-slash-general-manager named Thomas Carter, is far less confrontational in ways that go beyond the kitchen. Within two seconds of climbing the steps to this spare and intimate little dining room, you know that there will be a speech on how the menu works, that most of the dishes will be small, that sharing will be encouraged, that the noise level will climb steeply, that the meal will cost more than the menu prices lead you to believe. (This is a particular danger if you aren’t careful with wines, because Mr. Carter leads us into three-digit temptation much more often than you’d expect from a list that’s relatively compact.)        
The dishes aren’t composed of pixel-size bits of food that have to be divided by laser surgery; they generally share well. This is a good start, but then Estela, like many small-plates restaurants, neglects the so-called share plates that you actually eat from if you treat each new creation from the kitchen as a serving platter. The share plates at Estela are no bigger than tea saucers, and are rarely swapped out. One night assorted juices and sauces from eight recipes swirled together before a fresh plate came along. It was like seeing eight movies projected on the same screen at once.        
New or bigger plates would help you to focus on the energetic crackle Mr. Mattos gives beef tartare by folding fried sunchoke chips into the raw meat, or the low growl of spice he lends to a fried egg and gigante beans by pairing them with bread cubes dunked in harissa.        
Ingredients that don’t appear to have been tampered with often have a depth of flavor that takes you by surprise. There’s the invisible pop of yuzu and grapefruit hiding inside wheels of uncooked summer squash arranged like scales over intensely sweet raw scallops and puréed avocado. There’s the lemon that perks up white rounds of kohlrabi dressed, simply and wonderfully, with shards of fossa cheese, mint and crushed, toasted hazelnuts.

After months of contentious behind-the-scenes battles, the public may finally get its chance to own a piece of a New York City landmark — the Empire State Building.         
The real estate family that controls the 102-story Art Deco tower could move ahead as soon as this week with plans to sell shares to the public through a real estate investment trust, or REIT. It could be one of the largest initial public offerings ever of such a trust, in a deal valued at more than $5 billion.        
But even as Malkin Holdings races forward with the planned offering, which includes the iconic tower and 18 other office properties it operates in New York City and in Stamford, Conn., prospective buyers for the Empire State Building continue to come out of the woodwork.        
Last week, Joseph Sitt, a New York City landlord, increased his earlier bid. His company, Thor Equities, is now proposing to buy Empire State Building Associates, which owns the land, the building and the lease, for $1.4 billion in cash. That tops Mr. Sitt’s offer from earlier this summer, and is higher than the $1.18 billion that the entity is valued at as part of the REIT.        
“Seeing as this new offer came in above both the appraised and exchange values in the proposed REIT, that leads me to believe they are taking it very seriously,” said Jason Meister, an investment broker with Avison Young who represents Thor Equities.        
The offer by Mr. Sitt is the latest in a string of unsolicited bids that have been rebuffed by Peter L. Malkin and his son, Anthony E. Malkin, who contend that their plan, which has already been approved by stakeholders, is more valuable. Furthermore, most, if not all, of the bidders have had communications with Richard Edelman, a stakeholder in the Empire State Building who has led a group of dissidents opposed to the planned REIT.        
That has led to questions about whether the offers for the building are real or just attempts to derail the initial public offering. One of the “bids” was made on a single sheet of paper and provided no information about where the buyer would find the money to finance the building’s purchase. Additionally, Mr. Meister, who represents Mr. Sitt at Thor, is the son of Stephen Meister, a lawyer representing some of the dissident shareholders.        
This should be a chill-the-Champagne moment for the Malkins. Family members, who are minority owners of the building, have already won several crucial rounds in a long-running battle with dissident stakeholders. With the public offering, the Malkins would be catapulted into the upper echelons of Manhattan real estate — their stake could be valued at an estimated $730 million and provide other legal and tax benefits. Anthony Malkin would become chairman of a new company, Empire State Realty Trust.        
In 1961, 3,300 units in the building were sold to stakeholders at $10,000 a unit, with some individuals buying multiple units. After about a year of back-and-forth, the Malkins early this summer persuaded the required 80 percent of the building’s roughly 3,000 stakeholders to vote in favor of going public.        
While the Malkins still face a few remaining hurdles in their fight with the dissidents, including a court ruling expected this fall on whether a judge’s ruling on New York’s limited liability corporation laws was legal, they are pressing ahead with their plan for a public offering.        
A spokesman for the Malkins did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.        
There are also questions swirling around demand for a REIT featuring the Empire State Building as one of its cornerstones. While some investors will probably be drawn to the romantic notion of owning a piece of the fabled skyscraper, some analysts note that the building and several of the other properties included in the REIT are not viewed as modern, first-class office buildings. In recent years, the Malkins have embarked on a major renovation of the Empire State Building that is drawing a better, more corporate class of tenants and yielding higher rents.        
But the once-hot market for real estate investment trusts has cooled considerably since this spring. A Bloomberg index of office REITS is down 10.5 percent since hitting a four-and-a-half-year high in late May.        
“REITs did extremely well early in the year, but share prices have pulled back since May,” said Michael Knott, a managing director with real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. He said, however, that New York office REITs have held up better than those in other parts of the country, in the belief that Manhattan real estate has stabilized.        
While some of the bidders hope that the wobbly REIT market has opened the door for them to sweep in with a competing offer, analysts say the bids, so far, appear to be falling short. “The offers don’t appear high enough to persuade the Malkins to change direction,” Mr. Knott said.

WASHINGTON — The suspect in the killing of 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday test-fired an AR-15 assault rifle at a Virginia gun store last week but was stopped from buying one because state law there limits the sale of such weapons to out-of-state buyers, according to two senior law enforcement officials.        


Instead, the suspect, Aaron Alexis of Texas, bought a law-enforcement-style shotgun — an 870 Remington pump-action — and used it on Monday as he rampaged through the navy yard, said the officials, who requested anonymity because the investigation was continuing.        
“The gun was broken in half, and he had it in a bag,” one official said of the Remington. “He went inside the building and assembled it in a bathroom.”        
The gunman then perched himself above an atrium where he fired down on people who had been eating breakfast, officials said, adding that he used shotgun shells that had roughly a dozen large ball-bearing-like shots in them, increasing their lethal nature.        
“When he discharged, the pieces of lead would spread the farther they went,” the one official said. “It is similar to weapons used in bird shooting but on a more serious scale. These were not bullets but many small pieces of lead flying through the air.”        
After firing down on people, the gunman began to search for more people to shoot, and as he searched, he was confronted by a security guard near an exit, according to the officials. The gunman shot the guard and took his semiautomatic handgun, then headed back to the atrium.        
“He runs back upstairs and cranks off more rounds with the handgun and then heads to another stairwell, where he confronts a worker there and shoots him,” the official said.        
The gunman is believed to have shot the Navy employee, who worked in maintenance, with the pistol near another exit.        
On Saturday, Mr. Alexis bought the Remington shotgun and ammunition at the gun store and range in Lorton, Va., Sharpshooters Small Arms Range, where he also rented a rifle and practiced with it, according to a lawyer for the store.        
The lawyer, J. Michael Slocum, said in an e-mail that Mr. Alexis bought a Remington 870 Express 12-gauge shotgun and about two boxes of ammunition, or about 24 shells. The purchases were approved after the store owner conducted the required federal background check, Mr. Slocum said.        
“After the terrible and tragic events at the navy yard, the Sharpshooters was visited by federal law enforcement authorities, who reviewed the Range’s records, including video and other materials,” Mr. Slocum wrote. “So far as is known, Mr. Alexis visited the Range only once, and he has had no other contact with the Range.”        
The Virginia State Police said Tuesday that Mr. Alexis had passed all state and local background checks to buy the shotgun.        
Despite statements on Monday from senior law enforcement officials — which were widely reported in the news media, including in The New York Times — that an AR-15 had been found at the scene, no such gun has been found. The authorities say they do not believe the gunman used one.        
Federal officials said that there was some initial confusion at the scene about which firearms had been used and that it was hours before investigators were able to analyze video from the scene.        
It is unclear whether Mr. Alexis’s psychiatric issues ever progressed to the point that he was involuntarily committed to a mental health institution, or legally determined to be mentally ill or incompetent, either of which would have barred him from buying a gun.        
If neither applied — and most people who are treated for mental illness never get to that point — then his situation would be similar to other gunmen, like Jared L. Loughner, who killed 6 people and wounded 13, including former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, in Tucson in 2011, and James E. Holmes, who killed 12 people and wounded dozens in a Colorado movie theater last year.        
Mental health experts point out that the vast majority of people with mental illness are never violent. On the other hand, studies have found an increased risk for violence among those with serious mental illness, including schizophrenia, major depression or bipolar disorder.

If you haven’t watched “Key & Peele,” Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele’s sharp and periodically hilarious show on Comedy Central, you’ve got time before the premiere of Season 3 on Wednesday night to catch up. YouTube and comedycentral.com offer collections of their greatest hits, from “Das Negros” (Mr. Key and Mr. Peele in whiteface placating a Nazi played by Ty Burrell of “Modern Family”) to the original, sidesplitting “Substitute Teacher” (Mr. Key as an inner-city disciplinarian taking roll in a suburban classroom: “Where is A-A-Ron right now?”).        


Of course, sketch comedy is a hit-or-miss proposition, and watching a concentrated dose of Mr. Key and Mr. Peele’s best product could make the Season 3 premiere look a little pale by comparison. It gets off to a pointed but quiet start with a one-joke Trayvon Martin video, and most of what follows — a new “Substitute Teacher” sketch, a “Les Miz” spoof — will leave fans fidgety. The high point is an over-the-top, slightly surreal bit with Mr. Key as a rapper and Mr. Peele as his deranged hype man.        
Things look up in the second week, though, with a couple of sketches that display the pair’s talent for inspired silliness and their emphasis on the oddities and dangers of language. In one, Mr. Key plays a terror suspect who’s the victim of a terrible misunderstanding: his wiretapped conversations were about terriers. (“We write terrierist fiction! We spend a good deal of time discussing possible future terrierist plots.”)        
Mr. Key and Mr. Peele’s comedy is often called postracial, but it might be more accurate to call it postsatirical, at least compared with the work of someone like Dave Chappelle, whose 2003-6 Comedy Central show has influenced the format and themes of “Key & Peele.” Their best-known and most directly political sketches, the “Obama Anger Translator” series, are among their weakest — they are labored and not particularly insightful. What really sets “Key & Peele” apart are the stars’ performances. Mr. Key, especially, is a gifted comic actor able to sell a range of characters and attitudes, from ritualized black male anger to “you lookin’ at me?” Italian mobster bravado.        
The gangster role comes next week in a short, slight sketch redeemed by Mr. Key and Mr. Peele’s spot-on portrayals of off-duty goodfellas. As in “Das Negros,” they insert themselves in conventional white roles (the fleeing Jew, the crooked Italian), and the white people around them don’t notice. The joke is equally about race and pop-culture stereotypes, but when the bullets start flying it’s just purely, grossly funny.

Decades ago, each fall dance season began in Central Park. From 1962 to 1980 (except for gaps caused by financing in 1968 and 1973), an annual festival drew crowds to the Delacorte Theater. First it was called the Rebekah Harkness Foundation Dance Festival and then, from 1969 on, the New York Dance Festival, a name befitting its place in the civic fabric. Always it was free and eclectic, its program mixing established and little-known artists, its audiences mingling connoisseurs and first-timers. New Yorkers loved it, and after the financing collapsed, and it was gone, it was spoken of as “much-missed.”        


That festival is still defunct, but since 2004, its place has been taken by City Center’s Fall for Dance. Though the newer festival isn’t quite free — tickets, originally $10, are now $15 — it is eclectic, both in the dance companies that have participated (177 of them) and in those who have watched (220,000 tickets sold). Fall for Dance’s 10th installment doesn’t begin at City Center until next Wednesday, but as a celebratory prelude and a claim to a legacy, the festival brought dance back to the Delacorte for free shows (hosted by the Public Theater) on Monday and Tuesday.        
New York Dance Festival lore is filled with stories of dancers slipping and sliding in the rain, adventures in outdoor theater. But the weather on Monday night was clear and chill, with a nearly full harvest moon putting on a show of its own, alone above the stage or framed by tattered clouds. The proscenium arch of the firmament and a backdrop of trees make the Delacorte a site for dance like no other in the city.        
At first, the trees were occluded by scaffolding, a multilevel structure some 30 feet high, hung with work lights to resemble a makeup mirror. This was the set for “Human Fountain,” by Streb Extreme Action Company. The 20 performers, sleek in red unitards, marched on like astronauts before a launch, and launch is what they did, repeatedly climbing the scaffolding and diving off it to crash flat onto a thick mat below.        
There’s a vicarious thrill in the drop, and some variation in the form: tilted dives, backward dives, corkscrews, jackknives. There’s grace in a domino line of divers, each opening an arm to rotate into reverse falls. But the shapes in the air are halfhearted, and the choreography quickly grows dull. The piece keeps landing with a thud, bearing little relation to its Mozart accompaniment. It is supposedly inspired by the Bellagio fountains in Las Vegas, but those waterworks are much more musical. At this festival, it felt like an overextended pun.        
Still, “Human Foundation” is suited to the outdoors. Ronald K. Brown’s “Upside Down,” a much better, deeper work, lost some of its power in the open space. Instead of scaffolding, the dance was backed by rolling stage fog, lighted green or red, and by musicians: two drummers, a D.J. and the statuesque singer Wunmi Olaiya, working up a Fela Kuti groove. The rich suppleness of Mr. Brown’s West-African-based movement registered, as did the profundity in the work’s confrontation of life force and mortality, yet its group patterning seemed stretched thin. The dance burned but also guttered, like a flame in the wind.        
“Red Angels,” by Ulysses Dove, doesn’t belong anywhere. Certainly not in the repertory of New York City Ballet, which sent four of its dancers to represent the company in this inane double duet. That it’s set to a solo for electric violin (played live by Mary Rowell) is its practical justification. Yet, as an attempt at trashy, it isn’t even flashy, and from the troupe with the world’s greatest stock of ballets, it’s a terrible waste. What new dancegoer could fall for it?        
Blessedly, the evening finished with the Paul Taylor Dance Company in “Esplanade.” As its title tells you, this classic dance from 1975 is at home in the open air. On a program with the climbing and falling of “Human Fountain,” it made similar points about simple verbs. Mr. Taylor’s dancers walk, run, jump and crawl.        
But they do these basic activities to Bach, and the relationship between their actions and the music is meaningful. The meaning keeps changing: a hand extends in yearning, then in rejection; runs are playful, then distraught. The work is less dangerous than “Human Fountain,” but more daring. In the end, joy in motion triumphs, with the dancers diving across the stage. This is how to make audiences fall for dance, fall hard and fall for good.        



 
The Fall for Dance festival runs from next Wednesday through Oct. 5 at City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan; (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org.

The saxophone is the most ambiguous of instruments. Though ubiquitous in jazz and pop, it has long remained on the fringes of classical music, brought in for the occasional “Bolero,” but rarely afforded the spotlight. When it finds its way into the orchestra, it often functions as a jazzy outsider, an ambassador of pop.        


Few contemporary composers are better poised to trade on the saxophone’s ambivalent status than John Adams, who long ago mastered the art of moving nimbly between the classical and pop worlds. Mr. Adams has toyed with the instrument ever since he introduced a saxophone quartet into his opera “Nixon in China” a quarter-century ago. And in recent years, Mr. Adams has rediscovered the saxophone and its midcentury jazz legacy, even as he has distanced himself from young composers who draw on the commercial music of their own era.        
When the soloist Timothy McAllister and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra give the United States premiere of Mr. Adams’s Saxophone Concerto on Friday at Meyerhoff Symphony Hall in Baltimore, it will be an auspicious event for the large but often overlooked world of classical saxophonists. Those who miss the Baltimore performances can hear the concerto performed by Mr. McAllister and the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra in a live online broadcast on Oct. 5; Nonesuch will release a recording next spring.        
This new work grew out of Mr. Adams’s lifelong love for the slippery sound of the sax, and also took inspiration from the virtuoso technique of Mr. McAllister, who is a professor at the Bienen School of Music at Northwestern, and, at 40, one of the foremost saxophonists of his generation.        
In 2009, Mr. Adams heard Mr. McAllister play “City Noir,” Mr. Adams’s jazz-inflected symphonic work with a major saxophone part, and decided he had to write more for him.        
In a recent phone interview, Mr. Adams eagerly extolled Mr. McAllister’s strengths. “You find that with great artists that the details, the actual technical details of the instrument — the reed, the mouthpiece, the pads and all of those little, tiny, minuscule physical details — are so important,” Mr. Adams said. “On the one hand, that impressed me, and the other was just his absolute, indefatigable willingness to just do anything.”        
Mr. McAllister seized the opportunity. “For me, personally, Adams has been No. 1 — he’s been, for me, the No. 1 goal of someone we need to get a piece from,” he said recently. “It’s still Adams at the core: deep polyrhythmic structures, these huge, giant, kind of glacial forms. That’s really exciting, to hear these trademarks about his music and then referencing the saxophone in these multiple settings.”        
The saxophone has autobiographical implications for Mr. Adams, who says that it has always been “a part of my musical genealogy.” His father played alto in swing bands in the 1930s, and Mr. Adams dabbled with the sax in his youth. (His main instrument was clarinet.)        
Though the saxophone has its own classical repertory, Mr. Adams sought out models from jazz. Stan Getz’s 1961 album, “Focus,” and the compilation “Charlie Parker With Strings” were particular inspirations.        
“The sound of the saxophone with the orchestra, particularly with the string orchestra, is just magical,” Mr. Adams said. “It always puzzled me that there were so few saxophone concertos, and certainly no really great saxophone concerto in the way that there’s the Mozart Clarinet Concerto.”        
There are, in fact, more than a few saxophone concertos — just none that are regularly performed by symphony orchestras. (The best-known are by relatively obscure composers like Glazunov and Ibert.)        
Invented by Adolphe Sax in 1846 for military bands, the saxophone had a few early classical advocates, like Berlioz. But snobbery and intonation issues mostly kept the instrument out of the orchestra. Instead, saxophones found their way into American dance bands in the 1910s, and became core members of swing bands, as well as the instruments of choice for jazz soloists.

To Spoon: Fresh Vegetables Join the Yogurt Crowd  
For many years, Dan Barber has served savory vegetable yogurts in his restaurants, Blue Hill and Blue Hill at Stone Barns. He is now producing them for retail sale. Made with milk from grass-fed dairy cows in the Berkshires and upstate New York, including at his family’s Blue Hill Farm, these yogurts are blended with fresh local vegetable purées like beets, carrots, tomatoes and butternut squash. They are brightly colored, smooth and a little tart. The beet and carrot are the most vibrant, and the squash has a hint of spice; the tomato is fairly subtle: Blue Hill Yogurt is $2.99 for six ounces at Whole Foods Markets; bluehillyogurt.com.

                            “Maybe we never outgrow the imaginary animal kingdom of childhood. Maybe it’s the one we are trying to save.”        


                            These are Jon Mooallem’s intriguing words, written in the introduction to his book, “Wild Ones.” Its subtitle is “A Sometimes Dismaying, Weirdly Reassuring Story About Looking at People Looking at Animals in America,” but I thought of it on Sunday afternoon at La MaMa while watching “Sacred Elephant,” a South African production based on the poem by the Englishman Heathcote Williams; Americans haven’t cornered the market on Mr. Mooallem’s sentiments.        

                            Directed by Geoffrey Hyland and performed by Jeremy Crutchley, “Sacred Elephant” offers a torrent of words in praise of the creature’s nature and in despair over its fate. Yet even as Mr. Williams’s words indict humans for their treatment of these animals, they draw comparisons between the two species:        

And from a shared aquatic past, 

The elephant inherits the one quality 

That Homo sapiens has always arrogantly assumed 

Distinguishes him from the brute beast —  

An elephant in distress  

Will weep salt tears. 

                            As Mr. Crutchley speaks, he moves between man and beast and something more indeterminate; his character is called The Other, and he is a compelling figure in his long coat and ankle shackle. His face is etched with sweaty rivulets of gray makeup, his hair matted into a dreadlocked ponytail, his eyes redly rimmed. (Costume design is by Illka Louw.)        

                            At times during the play, a roughly hourlong monologue, Mr. Crutchley rides a wild, sharply edged energy that seems only partly moored to the words at hand. These words are by turns funny, caustic and, when least effective, self-consciously poetic. This wouldn’t seem the time for gilding the lily with odes to the noble elephant; it is difficult to be unmoved when considering the rapidity with which elephants are being exterminated. At the same time, if activism is the aim here it seems rather a misguided use of resources; it is also difficult to imagine a typical La MaMa audience containing people who are pleased at the idea of elephant extinction.        

                            And as a dramatic endeavor? “Sacred Elephant” could do with a bit more texture. (Mr. Crutchley works overtime to supply it.) But then again, lamentations aren’t necessarily vehicles for variety — and there isn’t much here to reassure, weirdly or otherwise.

Following is the text of remarks to reporters by Secretary of State John Kerry before a closed Senate briefing on Tuesday, as transcribed by Federal News Service:        


MR. KERRY: Hey folks. How are you doing? How are you?        
Yesterday, the United Nations issued an extraordinarily significant report regarding the gas attacks in Damascus on the 21st of August, and the detail in this report -- the types of munitions that were used, the trajectory of the rockets themselves, the type of sarin gas, the types of rockets, the identification markers -- all of these details are extraordinarily significant in pointing out that it really was the Assad regime that committed this attack, and this attack happened in the way that we described.        
So first of all, the report of the United Nations documents that what we said to the American people, what we said to the Congress and to the world, was absolutely true, and our intelligence community deserves enormous respect and gratitude for the capacity that it showed in putting this case fully together as quickly as it did.        
But this is -- what I’ve come here today to do is to brief the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the agreement that we reached with Russia in Geneva over the course of the weekend. It is an agreement that is important because it has the ability to get all of the Assad regime’s weapons out of Syria. That will happen only with the United Nations passing a strong resolution. It will happen with the enforcement of the world, with Russia standing by us in this effort, and it will happen, finally, because Assad lives up to what he has agreed to do.        
And the United States will not do any of this by trust. This is not a matter of trust. It’s a matter of verifying and verifying and enforcing. I think everybody in the United States needs to understand, please -- this would not have happened -- we would not have gotten this agreement if there had not been a legitimate threat of force that was passed by the Foreign Relations Committee and that the Congress was considering. That is what brought Russia and brought Assad to this table.        
And it is important that that threat of force stay on the table in order to guarantee the compliance of the Assad regime. So we will continue to press this issue; we’re determined to give diplomacy its fullest chance possible. That’s the president’s first choice. But the president has also determined that the word of the United States of America will mean what it is meant to mean, and so we will continue to be vigilant, and we will ask the Congress to stand with us in this effort over the course of the weeks ahead.        
Also want to say one other thing: Even while we have begun the process of addressing the weapons of mass destruction, the Assad regime wantonly, brutally, willfully continues to slaughter its own people. And while a lot of Americans feel this is something remote and it has no implications for us, that it’s just people over there killing themselves, I would say respectfully, it does have something to do with us.        
Key allies of ours, key friends of ours, Turkey, a NATO ally, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, they are all deeply affected. Their stability is affected. The ability of extremists to gain these weapons, to continue to grow in their strength, all has the ability to affect the security of the United States of America.        
And that’s why we need to continue to be vigilant and continue to put in place a strategy with the Congress and with the American people that will continue to protect us.        
Thanks very much, appreciate it.

Elvis Costello and the Roots began their encore at Brooklyn Bowl late Monday night with a wry lamentation, as churning and ominous as a gathering storm on the plains. The song was “Wise Up Ghost,” which provides both a title and a centerpiece for their trenchant new album on Blue Note. Its delivery was impassioned, unruly, a bit grandiose — gripping, but in a crucially different way from the rest of the show.        


Because otherwise, Mr. Costello, the eminent post-punk eclectic, and the Roots, hip-hop’s protean house band, gave an extended lesson in collaborative thrift, beefing up some of his old songs and cleanly tackling most of their new ones. Both parties have made a recent sport out of playing well with others, and here they chased a lean intensity, leaving few scraps on the bone. The show was sold out, and its high celebrity quotient underscored the sense of a rare occasion, which is more than the songs were prepared to do.        
“Wise Up Ghost,” the album, is a taut, sandpapery production, full of caustic pronouncements delivered with medium-cool affect. Mr. Costello sings evenly (if obliquely) about various forms of ruination and betrayal, against an assortment of vintage-distressed funk and soul grooves. At the foreground of every track is a drum part executed, with slippery precision, by Ahmir Thompson, a k a Questlove, the brain behind the Roots, and a musical savant whose obsessiveness rivals Mr. Costello’s.        
Perhaps taking a cue from certain Marvin Gaye records, the result of this synthesis can feel festive even in the grip of despair, as on “Walk Us Uptown,” the album’s lead single:        
Will you walk us uptown        
While our tears run in torrents        
To suffer in silence        
Or pray for some solace        
“Wake Me Up,” which opened the show at a prowling gait, was just as pointed: “There must be something better than this,” Mr. Costello groused in the chorus, reusing a line from his recent partnership with the New Orleans soul magistrate Allen Toussaint. (“My thoughts return to vengeance, but I put up no resistance,” goes another rueful line.)        
There’s a lot of strategic repurposing throughout “Wise Up Ghost,” and there was even more in the show. Some of this was as straightforward as an older tune given a fresh makeover: the Roots, working with a strong horn section, brought a sinister funk vibe to “Shabby Doll” and turned up the heat on “Spooky Girlfriend,” which also featured a spirited vocal turn by La Marisoul of the Los Angeles band La Santa Cecilia.        
And in the accumulative, deep-swirl crescendo on “I Want You,” there was a knowing echo of “I Want You (She’s So Heavy),” by John Lennon. It’s not hard to picture Questlove and Mr. Costello arriving together at that idea; in any case, another Lennon tune, “I Found Out,” served as a rawboned final encore, plunging toward Afro-punk.        
Other bits of repurposing were sneakier. “Tripwire,” a waltz that featured guest vocal harmonies by Diane Birch, bears more than a casual resemblance to “Satellite.” And on “Stick Out Your Tongue,” Mr. Costello interpolated whole lyric swatches from not one but two tunes from the vault, “Hurry Down Doomsday (The Bugs Are Taking Over)” and “Pills and Soap.” (One line, ripped well out of context, now suggests a hint of self-appraisal: “In time you can turn these obsessions into careers.”)        
Mr. Costello was in excellent, plangent voice throughout the show, which was archived online by wfuv.org. And he was in textbook form: chewing gum, standing at a slouch, exuding his indifferent charisma. Even by the high standard of his collaborative history, he was notably invigorated by his company.        
The Roots, meanwhile, now occupy a fascinating and maybe unprecedented position. Since proving wickedly adept with a variety format — Questlove and company will soon follow Jimmy Fallon from “Late Night” to “The Tonight Show” — the group has had a diminishing role for Black Thought (Tariq Trotter), its incisive workhorse of a rapper and frontman. He gamely does his part on “Late Night,” and he put in a token appearance on “Wake Up!” (G.O.O.D/Columbia/HomeSchool), the band’s 2010 album with John Legend.        
That he’s nowhere to be found on “Wise Up Ghost,” a product of analogous style and political conscience, feels like a slight, and maybe a further sign of shifting ground. But if there’s anything the Roots have proved in recent years, it’s the danger of jumping to conclusions about their intent. Count that among the ways Mr. Costello fits right in.

Following is the text of remarks to reporters by Secretary of State John Kerry before a closed Senate briefing on Tuesday, as transcribed by Federal News Service:        


MR. KERRY: Hey folks. How are you doing? How are you?        
Yesterday, the United Nations issued an extraordinarily significant report regarding the gas attacks in Damascus on the 21st of August, and the detail in this report -- the types of munitions that were used, the trajectory of the rockets themselves, the type of sarin gas, the types of rockets, the identification markers -- all of these details are extraordinarily significant in pointing out that it really was the Assad regime that committed this attack, and this attack happened in the way that we described.        
So first of all, the report of the United Nations documents that what we said to the American people, what we said to the Congress and to the world, was absolutely true, and our intelligence community deserves enormous respect and gratitude for the capacity that it showed in putting this case fully together as quickly as it did.        
But this is -- what I’ve come here today to do is to brief the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the agreement that we reached with Russia in Geneva over the course of the weekend. It is an agreement that is important because it has the ability to get all of the Assad regime’s weapons out of Syria. That will happen only with the United Nations passing a strong resolution. It will happen with the enforcement of the world, with Russia standing by us in this effort, and it will happen, finally, because Assad lives up to what he has agreed to do.        
And the United States will not do any of this by trust. This is not a matter of trust. It’s a matter of verifying and verifying and enforcing. I think everybody in the United States needs to understand, please -- this would not have happened -- we would not have gotten this agreement if there had not been a legitimate threat of force that was passed by the Foreign Relations Committee and that the Congress was considering. That is what brought Russia and brought Assad to this table.        
And it is important that that threat of force stay on the table in order to guarantee the compliance of the Assad regime. So we will continue to press this issue; we’re determined to give diplomacy its fullest chance possible. That’s the president’s first choice. But the president has also determined that the word of the United States of America will mean what it is meant to mean, and so we will continue to be vigilant, and we will ask the Congress to stand with us in this effort over the course of the weeks ahead.        
Also want to say one other thing: Even while we have begun the process of addressing the weapons of mass destruction, the Assad regime wantonly, brutally, willfully continues to slaughter its own people. And while a lot of Americans feel this is something remote and it has no implications for us, that it’s just people over there killing themselves, I would say respectfully, it does have something to do with us.        
Key allies of ours, key friends of ours, Turkey, a NATO ally, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, they are all deeply affected. Their stability is affected. The ability of extremists to gain these weapons, to continue to grow in their strength, all has the ability to affect the security of the United States of America.        
And that’s why we need to continue to be vigilant and continue to put in place a strategy with the Congress and with the American people that will continue to protect us.        
Thanks very much, appreciate it.

The sound, a D major chord produced by an orchestra and a chorus, begins abruptly, full force, and fills the air for 20 minutes, like a sonorous foghorn with a stuck switch. It ends as suddenly as it begins, but there is no applause because the orchestra is only half finished — its members sit without playing or even moving, “performing” silence for just as long.        


This highly eccentric symphony, receiving its first New York performance on Wednesday, was created by the artist Yves Klein, who is best known for his monochrome paintings. He harbored no small ambitions when he began thinking in the late 1940s about a kind of musical complement to his visual ideas: a symphony of monotony and silence, a much harder thing to do well than he or anyone imagined.        
“You can’t really do a full rehearsal of something like this,” said Roland Dahinden, a Swiss composer and performer who has conducted the piece four times in Europe and will take the baton (and stopwatch) in New York. “It’s too hard. Everyone would just die.” Klein was one of the leading heirs of Marcel Duchamp’s Modernist wit, but he was not joking around. “The Monotone-Silence” Symphony, he wrote, expressed no less than “what I wished my life to be.” But Klein, who died of a heart attack at the age of 34 in 1962, never had the chance to hear his symphony realized as he imagined it. For the only documented performance during his lifetime, in 1960, at an art gallery in Paris, with Klein himself in white tie as conductor, only 10 musicians participated.        
On Wednesday evening, the fulsome orchestra he dreamed of — 70 musicians and singers — will gather to perform the work at Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at East 73rd Street. The hope among those involved is that the sold-out performance, the product of months of intense planning, will hew closer to Klein’s ethereal intentions than many other versions attempted since his death.        
With that goal in mind, the performers and Mr. Dahinden have been preparing themselves mentally over the last few weeks for an unusual test of stamina, patience and repose: to play one note in an “intense and continuous” way, as Klein instructed, for an unreasonable amount of time and then to remain quiet and motionless for longer than most people ever do.        
Mr. Dahinden, who is being flown in for the one-night event by the Dominique Lévy Gallery, which is producing it, added: “When it’s right, you have this huge block of sound. There is such a beauty within the piece. You sit in the audience and you start to hear some melodies and some fragments of melodies, and yet nobody is playing them.” Klein said he saw the work as “having neither a beginning nor an end,” a creation “freed from the phenomenology of time.”        
To pull off the first half of the symphony, the singers and musicians — 10 cellists, 10 violinists, 3 bassists, 3 flutists, 3 oboists and 3 French horn players — need to produce the chord with no vibrato or variation, breathing and bowing in such a way as to create a sound with no audible breaks. (Early on, Klein compared the sound to a human scream and played recordings of screams — one quite harrowing example was the voice of the French playwright Antonin Artaud — to demonstrate.)        
Sahra Motalebi, a New York singer and performance artist who has helped to assemble the musicians and the choir — which will be made up of both professional singers and experimental musicians — said: “The reality is that it’s like a kind of bizarre primordial universe chorus. It’s not like a note you’ve ever heard.”        
Klein conceived of the idea for the symphony around 1947-48, the same years that John Cage, in New York, was formulating “4’33”,” a landmark work that involves a pianist not playing the piano but instead attuning an audience to the complexities of silence. Though there seems to be no evidence that Cage and Klein were aware of each other at the time or influenced each other later, Klein also came to view silence as the most important part of the musical work.        
“This is really my symphony,” he wrote, “and not the sounds during its performance.”        
Daniel Moquay, who oversees the Klein archive and estate in Paris, said the silence is sometimes more difficult than the sound for audiences to take in. “You get into the deepness of a silence and you realize that silence is not a nothing,” he said. “Silence is something that is very, very powerful.”        
The work anticipated some of the interests that Fluxus artists would soon begin exploring in New York and Europe in the 1960s, and it feels very much in tune with works by young contemporary artists like Ragnar Kjartansson, who in 2011 staged a critically acclaimed 12-hour performance of the denouement of Mozart’s “The Marriage of Figaro,” by opera singers.        
Klein’s symphony has been performed both with the permission of the estate, and without, over the last four decades — once by a chorus of as many as a hundred singers, and at least once by a single musician with a laptop.        
During the original 1960 performance, Klein included a companion piece in which three naked women — he called them “living brushes” — covered themselves in his signature deep blue paint and pressed their bodies on paper during the sound half of the symphony, freezing during the silence; that part will not be recreated in New York.        
Dominique Lévy, who is opening her new gallery at 909 Madison Avenue, next door to the church, became determined to produce the symphony to accompany her inaugural exhibition, “Audible Presence: Lucio Fontana, Yves Klein, Cy Twombly,” an examination of ideas about time and music in works by those three artists. (Tickets for the free performance were all claimed almost immediately after it was announced.)        
Ms. Lévy first heard the symphony in 2007 and said that after the abrupt cut between the sound and the silence, “I had all these conflicting feelings of wanting to laugh and then confusion and then finally deep emotion.”        
Early this year, she secured permission from the Klein archive to produce the work and dispatched Jennifer G. Buonocore, the gallery’s associate director, to Paris to delve into the archive, to try to ensure that the work would be realized with the best understanding of what Klein wanted.        
But even with the best efforts and intentions, Mr. Moquay said, the symphony doesn’t always work. Of four performances held in a Paris church during a Klein exhibition at the Pompidou Center in 2007, he said he felt that only one was wholly successful. But it worked so well, he added, that a lovely kind of St. Francis moment occurred.        
“The door of the church was open, and a pigeon came in and sat where everyone could see him,” he said. “During the 20-minute silence, he did not move at all. It was kind of incredible. And then when the silence was over, he left.”

As the director of the Rockettes, Linda Haberman knew it was time to leave Santa behind. As she put it, “Christmas is kind of a safe place to live.”        


Comfort zones have never interested Ms. Haberman. Beginning on March 27, she will unveil “Heart & Lights,” the Rockettes’ first spring production at Radio City Music Hall since 1997. Playing for 59 performances, it will have nothing to do with the Music Hall’s previous Easter spectacles. In the new show, Ms. Haberman brings New York City to life while continuing to modernize the precision dance company with more athletic, technically demanding choreography.        
“This is not a book musical, and it’s not a revue,” she said. “It’s like its own animal.”        
And this animal, at present, has no traditional kick line.        
“You’re going to see a lot of stuff you’ve never seen the Rockettes do before,” Ms. Haberman said. “I’m definitely expanding their vocabulary. In this show, I felt like there were no limits.”        
On Wednesday, a section from “Electricity,” a number inspired by Times Square, will be unveiled on NBC’s “America’s Got Talent.” The dance is a showcase for Ms. Haberman’s radical new version of a kick line: it features a développé, in which the leg slowly unfolds and is held for a count, and includes only four kicks. “I’ve been experimenting with ways to create the same feeling without doing the literal kick line,” she said.        
Produced by the Madison Square Garden Company, “Heart & Lights” features a story by Doug Wright, the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winner for “I Am My Own Wife.” The tale follows two teenage girls through New York as they unearth clues about their grandmother’s past.        
During the journey, the Rockettes perform dances that draw on the essence of New York landmarks like the Metropolitan Museum of Art (a modern dance with an Egyptian flair), Central Park (a moody tap number set to the Eurythmics’ “Here Comes the Rain Again”) and the stock exchange (a fast, athletic dance that incorporates knee turns and hip-hop).        
“For us, it’s about making sure that we maintain the precision part of it,” Ms. Haberman said. “As long as we have a specific point of view about what we’re doing, I don’t think we’re breaking our tradition.”        
Still, this is a new era for the Rockettes, founded in 1925 by Russell Markert as the Missouri Rockets. His remarkable “Parade of the Wooden Soldiers,” choreographed in 1933, remains a highlight of the “Christmas Spectacular.” In “Heart & Lights,” Ms. Haberman creates her own response to it.        
“The simplicity of that has always just killed me, because it’s so brilliant,” she said. “I’m like, what can I do? When visitors come to New York, they’re like: ‘Oh my God, you walk so much. I can’t believe how much you walk!’ So it starts out with one Rockette walking, and then another, and then patterns happen, and it builds and builds until it gets crazy. It looks like two solid lines are bisecting each other.”        
Unlike the “Radio City Christmas Spectacular,” which features two casts and opens on Nov. 8, “Heart & Lights” has only one cast. Recently, the unthinkable happened: an audition for the show was held among the Rockettes.The dancer Traci Reszetylo, who has worked on the production since its beginnings, doesn’t know if she’s in or out.        
“I just try to keep myself calm,” she said. “It means so much to me just to even have been a part of it for this long.”        
But as much as the Rockettes are at the core of “Heart & Lights,” Ms. Haberman is also hoping to create a deeper emotional connection with the show.        
“It’s great to see dances that move you, and all of that, but I thought that with the city and the Rockettes, there’s just a story that’s universal to all of us,” she said. “It’s about where you come from and where you want to go. It’s about why people come to New York: to chase their dreams. I was one of those people.”

The busy violinist Johnny Gandelsman was supposed to have made his New York recital debut on Aug. 13 at Le Poisson Rouge. But fate intervened; announcing the concert’s cancellation on Twitter, he compressed into a hashtag the saying, “If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.”        


In remarks from the stage at the rescheduled recital on Monday, Mr. Gandelsman said, without elaboration, that it had not been bad news that forced him to cancel. The only apparent down side for him was that Le Poisson Rouge, its fall season already crowded, could only fit him into a slot at 10:30 p.m.        
That may not have been a down side at all. Even over 90 intermissionless minutes of dense solo violin music, there were few yawns from the attentive and enthusiastic audience, and — just as in Lincoln Center’s series A Little Night Music — the late hour added more coziness to what was already an intimate program and space.        
A fixture on the New York music scene, Mr. Gandelsman plays in the string quartet Brooklyn Rider and the chamber orchestra  the Knights, and has long been a member of the stylistically omnivorous Silk Road Ensemble. In 2008 he founded a label, In a Circle Records.        
Juxtapositions of old and new energize all these groups. Brooklyn Rider has performed and recorded “Seven Steps,” a partly improvised group composition, alongside the work that inspired it, Beethoven’s Opus 131 string quartet. So it was no surprise that Mr. Gandelsman’s recital ranged from the Baroque to Philip Glass.        
But the program was planned and performed to emphasize coherence rather than diversity, a treatment that was particularly revelatory when it came to the choice of Mr. Glass’s “Strung Out” (1967). While many have remarked on Indian music and rock’s influence on his early work, Mr. Glass’s early-music connection has been less noted.        
But played between  Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber’s grand Passacaglia and Bach’s Sonata No. 3, “Strung Out” sounded quintessentially Baroque, with the same tension between stillness and motion, the same workings and reworkings of small pieces of musical material. Mr. Gandelsman — his ornamentation immaculate and nimble, like sparks in a dark church — was as attentive to the music’s broad narrative as to tiny shifts of texture and mood, his tone translucently smooth at one point and with a dusky burr at another.        
Wearing jeans, a vest and short sleeves, Mr. Gandelsman looked folksy, and his playing was accordingly unpretentious, modest and clear, with irresistible lightness, a bright trill and a preternatural (perhaps premature) wistfulness. His vibrato was restrained in Stravinsky’s somber “Élégie” (written in 1944 for viola), and there was a core of melancholy calm even in the jovial moments of his rendition of Bach’s Partita No. 2, which ended almost exactly at midnight.

The Patriarch Tikhon Choir, a mixed-voice professional ensemble of 35 American, Canadian and Russian singers, was formed recently to focus on Orthodox Christian sacred music, a tradition it hopes to nurture in the United States.        


A substantial audience that included many monks turned up to hear the ensemble — named for a missionary saint who helped expand Orthodoxy in early 20th-century America — give its debut concert on Monday evening at St. Malachy’s Roman Catholic Church (the Actors’ Chapel) in the theater district.        
Led by Vladimir Gorbik, a conductor on the faculty of the Moscow State Conservatory, the ensemble offered a program called “Their Sound Hath Gone Forth.” It featured works from the Orthodox All-Night Vigil and Divine Liturgy, including stark centuries-old Znamenny Chant, with selections sung in both Church Slavonic and English.        
The chorus demonstrated an appealingly blended sound, austere and somber in the chant and joyous and more full-blooded in the works by Rachmaninoff.        
According to the program book, contemporary composers who write sacred music and embrace the Orthodox Church are not interested “in constructing a unique musical identity for themselves per se, but rather in faithfully carrying on and humbly adding to a living tradition of sung prayer, just as their predecessors did before them.” (One exception, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, has created sacred works in a distinctive contemporary style.)        
The arrangements and compositions by living or 20th-century Russian and American Orthodox composers included on the lineup here — like Benedict Sheehan’s “Thrice-Holy” (2012) — had nothing in the way of harmonic twists or other contemporary markers to distinguish them from the traditional pieces on the program.        
The polyphonic selections proved to be the highlights, in particular an arrangement by Sergius Trubachov of “Gladsome Light,” a type of chant that originated in the Valaam Monastery in northwestern Russia and blends features of Byzantine and Znamenny genres. The female, then male voices blended beautifully, quiet and reserved before swelling to a more sumptuous sound.        
The program concluded with “Let God Arise,” a concerto by Dmitry Bortniansky (1751-1825), in which a lone soprano soared expressively above the choir.

REDMOND, Wash. — Microsoft said on Tuesday that its board had approved a 22 percent increase in the company’s quarterly dividend, to 28 cents, along with a new $40 billion stock buyback program.        


The new dividend is an increase of 5 cents over its previous dividend and will be paid on Dec. 12 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 21.        
The increase will cost Microsoft, the world’s largest software company, an extra $416 million a quarter, based on the 8.33 billion shares that FactSet says the company has outstanding.        
The new stock buyback program has no expiration date and replaces Microsoft’s previous $40 billion stock buyback program, which was set to expire on Sept. 30.        
Microsoft’s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said the moves reflected the company’s continued commitment to returning cash to its shareholders.        
The company has made a number of big moves recently, announcing this month a $7.2 billion deal to buy Nokia’s troubled smartphone business in hopes of catching up with the shift toward mobile computing.        
While Microsoft’s software business remains profitable, it has come under pressure as more people move away from traditional desktop and laptop computers and toward mobile devices.        
In addition, Microsoft’s chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, who negotiated the Nokia deal, recently announced plans to retire within the next year, acknowledging that the company needed a different leader to take it in a new direction.        
Shares of Microsoft rose 13 cents, up 0.4 percent, closing at $32.93. That takes the stock closer to its 52-week high of $36.43, set July 16. It traded as low as $26.26 in December.

                            One minute, you’re going about your business, absent-mindedly walking into a head-on collision with a bus; the next, you’re stuck in a room, subject to the whims of a rather officious middle manager. That’s life — and whatever it is that comes immediately after it, as imagined in “The Life and Sort of Death of Eric Argyle.”        


                            Written by Ross Dungan and directed by Dan Herd, this 95-minute production is having its American premiere at 59E59 Theaters, presented by 15th Oak as part of the 1st Irish festival. The work is a self-assured ensemble effort, charming despite its self-conscious concept.        

                            The concept is this: Eric Argyle (the terrifically understated Dave McEntegart), having managed to get himself killed, is now working his way through a purgatorial process — a hurried one, if such a thing is possible. The stakes aren’t made entirely clear till the end, but it’s obvious that they are high. With the audience implicated as a silent jury, Eric suffers through re-enactments of pivotal and poignant moments in this life, watching as his younger self (James Murphy) yearns deeply yet never quite follows through on his desires, particularly when it comes to the object of his affection, Gillian (Siobhan Cullen).        

                            Yes, inevitably, there is a girl. Mr. Dungan takes an obvious delight in language and in tussling with weighty questions about what it is to live and connect with others; it’s too bad so many of these inquiries peter out in favor of a rather boilerplate emphasis on romantic love.        

                            If the play feels labored and thin at times, the pacing hums briskly. The eight actors zip through multiple roles and scene changes, deftly rearranging the furniture in Colm McNally’s homey set and often providing their own musical accompaniment.        

                            Eric lived a quiet external life, but his inner one, as demonstrated by the novel he spent many years writing, was full of riches; it’s a pleasure to watch this troupe tease out those riches.  In the end, things both resolve and don’t, as the production brings us to the actual death of Eric Argyle, in satisfyingly gentle fashion.

WASHINGTON — Consumer prices barely rose in August, but rising rents and medical costs pointed to some stability in underlying inflation that could make the Federal Reserve more comfortable about trimming its bond purchases.        


A Labor Department report on Tuesday showed inflation largely under control, and some details suggested that a downward drift in prices earlier in the year had probably run its course.        
“This should give policy makers greater confidence that the inflation soft patch in the first half was indeed transitory,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.        
The Fed’s policy makers have been holding a two-day meeting on monetary policy. Most economists expect the central bank to announce on Wednesday that it is scaling back its purchases of $85 billion a month in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, which are aimed at keeping interest rates low and stimulating the economy.        
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month as the cost of energy fell and food prices remained muted. The index rose 0.2 percent in July. In the 12 months through August, it increased at a slow rate of 1.5 percent after advancing 2 percent in the 12 months through July.        
Stripping out the volatile energy and food components, the so-called core C.P.I. rose 0.1 percent after increasing by 0.2 percent in each of the past three months. Rents and medical care accounted for most of the increase.        
The latest gain took the increase in the core index over the last 12 months to 1.8 percent, the largest rise since March. The core gained 1.7 percent in July.        
Earlier in the year, core inflation was moving lower and reached levels that caused unease among some Fed officials. It touched a two-year low of 1.6 percent in June, but has been inching up for the last two months.        
The Fed has a target of 2 percent annual inflation, although it tracks a gauge that tends to run a bit below the Consumer Price Index. The Fed’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has viewed the low inflation as temporary and expects prices to push higher as the economy strengthens.        
Last month, inflation was held back by a 0.3 percent drop in energy as the cost of gasoline, electricity and natural gas fell. Energy prices had increased 0.2 percent in July. Food prices gained 0.1 percent, rising by the same margin for a second month.        
Rent, which accounts for about a third of the core C.P.I., rose 0.4 percent in August, as apartment vacancies declined.        
Medical costs rose 0.6 percent, the largest increase since July 2007. Prescription drugs also recorded their biggest rise since July 2007. Medical care, which makes up more than 9 percent of the core, has been one of the key contributors to the low inflation early in the year.        
“What consumers are saving on gas they are paying for in medical care and rent,” said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial. “Even with consumer prices in check, however, the year-over-year increase in rents will support the case for tapering.”

NIAMEY, Niger — In Niger, government officials have fought a Chinese oil giant step by step, painfully undoing parts of a contract they call ruinous. In neighboring Chad, they have been even more forceful, shutting down the Chinese and accusing them of gross environmental negligence. In Gabon, they have seized major oil tracts from China, handing them over to the state company.        


China wants Africa’s oil as much as ever. But instead of accepting the old terms, which many African officials call unconditional surrender, some cash-starved African states are pushing back, showing an assertiveness unthinkable until recently and suggesting that the days of unbridled influence by the African continent’s mega-investor may be waning.        
For years, China has found eager partners across the continent, where governments of every ilk have welcomed the nation’s deep pockets and hands-off approach to local politics as an alternative to the West.        
Now China’s major state oil companies are being challenged by African governments that have learned decades of hard lessons about heedless resource-grabs by outsiders and are looking anew at the deals they or their predecessors have signed. Where the Chinese companies are seen as gouging, polluting or hogging valuable tracts, African officials have started resisting, often at the risk of angering one of their most important trading partners.        
“This is all we’ve got,” said Niger’s oil minister, Foumakoye Gado. “If our natural resources are given away, we’ll never get out of this.”        
Below Mr. Gado’s seventh-floor office, reached through a dark stairwell because there is no working elevator, his fellow citizens are living in mud-brick houses without electricity and washing their clothes in the river. Oil production in Niger began nearly two years ago but has yet to make a dent in living standards.        
“We’ve got to fight to get full value for these resources,” Mr. Gado said. “If they are valued correctly, we can hope to bring something to our people.”        
Seven hundred miles away in the oil-producing region, Chinese refinery workers and engineers massed boisterously at a crumbling and otherwise unused airport for their quarterly holiday flights out, one of the many costs that Mr. Gado said Niger, at the bottom of the United Nations human development index, could not afford.        
A private auditor hired by Niger recently found bloated costs and unfair charges by the China National Petroleum Corporation, providing Niger with ammunition for its next round of tense negotiations in Beijing, Mr. Gado suggested. Tens of millions of dollars have already been scored off the Chinese through such painstaking revisions.        
Across the border in Chad, officials have taken a harder line with China National Petroleum, reflecting a growing confidence after 10 years of oil production that has brought the country new roads and public buildings, a revamped army, and a strengthening of the government’s grip on power, though little change in the country’s low poverty ranking.        
The country’s oil minister shut down the Chinese operations in mid-August after discovering that they were dumping excess crude oil in ditches south of the capital, N’Djamena, then making Chadian workers remove it with no protection.        
“Just dumped in the open,” said Antoine Doudjidingao, an economist who helps lead an oil watchdog group in N’Djamena. “This is a serious case, the first of its kind. You can’t just shut your eyes in the face of it. It’s a responsible reaction.”        
Last month Chad’s oil minister refused to allow the Chinese to resume operations, even expelling the company’s local director-general and his assistant. There would be no resumption, the government said, until the Chinese built remediation and treatment facilities.        
“Regardless of the actual spillage, which the Chadian government would normally not care much about, this seems to be a warning, which just goes to show that even the prototypical weak state in Africa can have serious leverage, and that African-Chinese relations are not as unbalanced as is sometimes argued,” said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, a politics professor at Oxford and an expert on African oil.

Bill de Blasio opens the final phase of his bid for New York City mayor with a daunting lead over his Republican opponent, Joseph J. Lhota, who appears to face a tougher path to victory than even his most pessimistic supporters imagined.        


Mr. de Blasio, whose last remaining rival for the Democratic nomination conceded this week, enjoys support from 65 percent of likely voters, compared with 22 percent who back Mr. Lhota, according to a WNBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Tuesday.        
That 43-point gap would be intimidating for nearly any candidate. But Mr. Lhota must also win over an electorate in a city in which registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by nearly six to one, and the low poll numbers could further depress his already lackluster fund-raising.        
There are copious caveats. The general election has just begun. Mr. Lhota, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority who was a deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration, is not well known by the public. A finely tuned television advertisement can upend a race. And Mr. de Blasio, currently the city’s public advocate, is riding enormous momentum and news media attention after his primary victory.        
But the last Republican underdog to pull off a mayoral upset — a billionaire named Michael R. Bloomberg, who first won in 2001 — did not trail by such a large amount after the party primaries.        
About 9 percent of voters remain undecided, and 3 percent are supporting Adolfo Carrión Jr., a third-party candidate running on the Independence Party line. The survey includes voters who are undecided but were leaning toward a particular candidate.        
Mr. de Blasio’s advantage is across the board: he is beating Mr. Lhota in every borough and among men, women, whites and Latinos. Mr. Lhota’s support among black voters is 3 percent.        
In perhaps the most troubling sign for the Republican nominee, negative impressions have already started to form about him before he has a chance to fully introduce himself to the electorate.        
Only 30 percent of registered voters say they have never heard of Mr. Lhota, and 41 percent said they had an unfavorable view of him. Mr. de Blasio was viewed positively by about two-thirds of registered voters.        
Mr. Lhota has drawn a stark contrast with Mr. de Blasio on public safety, saying he is the only candidate who will keep crime rates down. But 44 percent of voters said they believed Mr. de Blasio would do a better job on fighting crime, compared with 35 percent for Mr. Lhota.        
And in a stinging blow for Mr. Lhota, a former city budget director, only 35 percent of voters said he would be a better manager of municipal finances, compared with 45 percent for Mr. de Blasio.        
The poll, conducted by the Marist Institute for WNBC and The Wall Street Journal using landlines and cellphones, surveyed 930 registered voters, including 632 likely voters, on Sunday and Monday. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for registered voters, and four points for likely voters.

KHARTOUM, Sudan — On the corner of an old colonial building in downtown Khartoum sits the city’s oldest bookstore, Sudan Bookshop. It was established in 1902, three years after Britain established control over Sudan, and for a long time it was a magnet for the city’s civil servants, politicians and intellectuals.        


Today, however, it is a ghost of itself. It is dusty, cold and empty of buyers, and it displays books published mostly in the ’70s and ’80s.        
Sudan Bookshop’s manager, El Tayeb Abdel-Rahman, 69, still comes to work every morning at 8:30. Dressed in a chic suit and tie, he awaits customers who rarely come.        
“We used to order a shipping container of books every month or two,” he recalled sadly. “But now no one reads anymore.”        
These are hard times for bookstores everywhere, of course. And as in other book-loving corners, Sudanese are quick to lament that technology and the Internet have been turning eyes away from pages and toward screens.        
But there is more at work here, in a city long famous as a big market for Arabic writers. Books and reading are embedded profoundly in Khartoum’s self-image and the country’s history, and there is growing worry that the collapse of book culture is a direct mirror of the country’s overall decline.        
Most Sudanese are more concerned with bread than books, and for good reason. Years of war, drought and economic privation have left deep marks. A once prestigious education system has crumbled, and the number of bookstores in Khartoum has fallen with it.        
That sense of urgency and loss is driving a new wave of activism, with its sights on reviving Khartoum’s reputation as a literary city.        
“We want to bring people back to books,” said Abdullah Al-Zain, 58, who started a project with friends called Mafroush — a Sudanese Arabic word meaning displayed.        
In a monthly showcase held every first Tuesday, participating used-book sellers come to downtown Khartoum’s Etinay Square and lay their books on the ground over cloth sheets or flattened carbon boxes.        
Hundreds of book lovers, including students, artists and writers, showed up on a recent afternoon, some gazing over the sprawl of covers, some flipping pages attentively. Others arrived with more books for the display.        
“You see, we don’t like to call them ‘used’ books — rather, ‘rebated,’ ” Mr. Al-Zain said.        
Al-Mutasim Hassan, 25, a graduate student, came searching for philosophy books. “I think Mafroush is a creative endeavor, and you meet other readers,” he said.        
Mr. Hassan holds himself apart from others in his generation who think “Facebook and chat are the only expressions of progress,” he said.        
“I find myself, however, that when I read a book, I feel alive,” he added.        
For many who are trying to revive reading here, the Internet is turning into an ally.        
“The Internet is not necessarily an enemy of books,” Mr. Al-Zain said. “It is so only for those who want it to be such. We use the Internet to promote our programs.”        
Across town, in Khartoum’s Green Square, another group is also trying to encourage Sudanese to return to books.        
Hundreds of Sudanese youths met in the square on another afternoon, each with a book in hand. For the next few hours, they sat on the grass and either individually read books quietly, or joined a discussion circle with others.        
“We want to revive the habit of reading in public spaces,” said Raghda El-Fatih, 18, a volunteer with Education Without Borders, a group that called for a “Khartoum Is Reading” day.        
Education Without Borders grew out of a discussion between two college graduates who wanted to tackle the many problems facing education in Sudan. They started a Facebook page, and now have thousands of members.        
“One member suggested organizing a day for reading,” said Wisal Hassan, 25, one of the group’s founders. So far, the group has organized two reading days, including one that coincided with the United Nations’ World Book Day.        
“It’s been a great success,” Mr. Hassan added.        
A sense of Sudanese tradition infuses the revival efforts, and those of writers trying to fuel them.

Any public officials convicted of federal corruption charges could lose their government pension under new policies announced on Tuesday night by the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan.        


The policies, aimed at ending the longstanding practice of jailed politicians continuing to collect public money, were detailed by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, at the first public hearing of the Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption. The 25-member panel was established in July by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to address what has been widely decried as a corruption crisis in Albany and other political spheres in New York State.        
Mr. Bharara said that as part of the initiative, prosecutors in his office filed court papers on Monday in two separate corruption cases giving notice that they were adding the pensions of two state senators, a city councilman and two other officials to the list of property subject to forfeiture if the officials are convicted. Any forfeiture action against a convicted official’s pension would require judicial approval.        
Mr. Bharara called it “a galling injustice” that corrupt officials can “draw a publicly funded pension” until their “dying day.”        
He said that the statute under which officials for decades have been able to collect their pensions despite corruption convictions was an “error of state law,” and he noted that while it had been partially fixed several years ago, it “must succumb to common sense.”        
“Convicted politicians should not grow old comfortably cushioned by a pension paid for by the very people they betrayed in office,” he said.        
More than 30 New York State politicians have been indicted or convicted of a crime, censured or otherwise accused of misconduct in the last seven years. The officials whose pensions could become subject to forfeiture as a result of the new filings are State Senator Malcolm A. Smith; State Senator Eric Stevenson; City Councilman Daniel J. Halloran; and Noramie Jasmin and Joseph Desmaret, the mayor and deputy mayor of the Rockland County town of Spring Valley.        
Senator Smith, a Democrat, and Councilman Halloran, a Republican, both from Queens, were charged on April 2 with plotting to bribe Republican Party bosses to place the senator on the ballot in the city’s mayoral race. The two Spring Valley officials were charged in the same case in a separate real estate scheme. Mr. Stevenson was charged two days later in an unrelated case, accused of taking more than $22,000 in bribes to help developers open adult day care centers in his Bronx district.        
Mr. Smith’s lawyer, Gerald L. Shargel, said the action by prosecutors was premature. “They can’t have forfeiture without a conviction, and what I’m focusing on is defending the allegations in the indictment, and I’m eager to do that,” he said.        
Vinoo P. Varghese, a lawyer for Councilman Halloran, contended that it was inappropriate for Mr. Bharara to speak about his client before the public commission because, he said, the councilman had not committed a crime.        
Lawyers for Mr. Stevenson and Ms. Jasmin declined to comment, and Mr. Desmaret’s lawyer did not respond to e-mail and voice mail messages.        
Mr. Bharara said that under his office’s new policies, prosecutors would also seek what he called “appropriate fines” with an eye toward the money that convicted corrupt officials might receive from publicly financed pensions so “the punishment fits the crime and so we can take the profit out of that crime.”        
He also said that his office would consider civil forfeiture actions against the pensions of corrupt officials who were previously convicted and who failed to pay fines, forfeiture or restitution imposed at sentencing in order to satisfy those criminal judgments.        
And in future cases, as well as pending ones like those in which action was taken on Monday, prosecutors will use federal forfeiture laws to strip politicians convicted of corruption charges.        
The panel, convened at Pace University, also heard testimony from Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, and Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney. Ms. Lynch outlined some of the current allegations facing legislators, including filing false travel vouchers and more serious crimes like obstruction of justice, while Mr. Vance called for toughening state corruption laws, which he said were weaker that those that prohibited things like fixing a fight.        
“Those that bribe public officials in New York are less likely to be prosecuted than those that bribe boxers,” Mr. Vance said.        
Outside, protesters gathered to rally for stronger corruption laws, chanting “Follow the money!” amid a heavy police and security presence. But the establishment of the corruption commission has been met with a lukewarm response in the Legislature, which failed to pass a comprehensive corruption and campaign bill earlier this year.        
William J. Fitzpatrick, the district attorney in Onondaga County and the commission’s co-chairman, made a veiled reference to that in opening remarks to the panel, which includes nine other district attorneys from around the state, law professors and lawyers at major private firms.        
“You might think that if you ran a business where 35 of your employees in a five-year period were indicted, convicted or investigated and led out in handcuffs, that this might inspire a period of reflection,” Mr. Fitzgerald said.        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 20, 2013An article on Wednesday about a New York prosecutor’s plan to curtail the pensions of officials convicted of corruption misidentified, in some editions, the county in which Spring Valley, N.Y., is located. It is in Rockland County, not Westchester.

The federal judge who ordered changes to the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk strategy has declined to delay them pending appeal.        
The judge, Shira A. Scheindlin of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, said on Tuesday that granting the city’s request would send the wrong signal.        
Judge Scheindlin said a decrease in the number of stops from their peak in 2011 was already due in part to her orders over the past several years, and she said that delaying the effects of her August decision would send the message that reducing the number of stops is somehow dangerous to residents.        
She ordered reforms after finding that the practice discriminates against minorities.        
The city law office did not immediately comment.

CAIRO — Security forces on Tuesday arrested Gehad el-Haddad, a senior official of the Muslim Brotherhood who handled the group’s communication with the foreign news media, security officials said. His arrest was part of a continuing roundup of thousands of Brotherhood members in the two months since the military ouster of President Mohamed Morsi, an ally of the group.        


Mr. Haddad is an aide to Khairat el-Shater, a Brotherhood leader who was arrested last month, and the son of Mr. Morsi’s top foreign policy adviser, Essam el-Haddad, who was detained with Mr. Morsi at the time of the takeover. The arrests have already swept up much of the group’s leadership, effectively crippling its organizational ability.        
Mr. Haddad’s main role in recent months was speaking to the English-language media, and critics of the Brotherhood have often accused Mr. Haddad of misinformation and exaggeration, especially in comments posted on the Internet. Although he constantly repeated the group’s renunciation of violence to the news media, news reports said Tuesday that he would be charged with inciting violence.        
Prosecutors have brought the same charge against Mr. Morsi, Mr. Shater and many others.        
Mr. Haddad has lived as a fugitive since Aug. 14, when security forces broke up a Brotherhood-led sit-in against the takeover here, and he moved daily between apartments while avoiding telephones for fear of surveillance. He was educated primarily in Britain; before he began working full time for the Brotherhood he worked in Egypt for the Clinton Foundation, established by former President Bill Clinton.        
The police appear to have targeted several Brotherhood spokesmen in recent weeks. Among others recently arrested was Mourad Aly, a volunteer consultant to the group’s political party whose main job for the last 10 years was as a marketing executive for the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck.        
Mr. Aly was apprehended at the airport trying to board a flight to a corporate meeting abroad. A company spokesman said Lundbeck was working with Egyptian lawyers and the Danish Embassy in Cairo to seek his release.

ZANZIBAR, Tanzania — The police in Zanzibar said Tuesday that they had arrested 15 people in connection with a spate of acid attacks in recent months.        


Police Commissioner Mussa Ali Mussa said some suspects had links to Al Qaeda and the Somali Islamist extremist group Shabab, but he offered no evidence to support that statement. When pressed for details, Commissioner Mussa hung up, and his cellphone was turned off.        
Earlier, he said the police had seized 29 liters of acid from various people who were not legally entitled to have it.        
Last week, a Catholic priest was badly injured in the fifth acid attack in Zanzibar since November. The attacks included one last month in which two young British women doing volunteer work were injured when acid was thrown in their faces.        
Some analysts took issue with the assertion that terror groups have a presence in Zanzibar and may have been involved in the attacks.        
Mohammed Hafidh, an economist, said he doubted the validity of the police commissioner’s statement.        
Mr. Hafidh said the acid attacks did not bear the hallmarks of Qaeda and Shabab acts. Both groups are known for deadly and large-scale attacks.        
The acid attacks are affecting tourism, Zanzibar’s main economic activity, Mr. Hafidh said.        
Zanzibar, a melting pot of African, Indian and Arabian cultures and influences, draws visitors from around the world attracted by the archipelago’s natural beauty and powdery white sand beaches.        
Ahmeid Rajab, the managing director of the Somali satellite television network Universal TV, said Zanzibar was unlikely to have a Shabab or Qaeda presence, adding, “After all, those radical groups never, ever use acid to advance their goals.” He said the police were looking for an excuse to escape blame for failing to arrest real suspects.

Mr. Knakal, 51, is the chairman of Massey Knakal Realty Services, a commercial real estate brokerage firm in New York. He started the company in 1988 with Paul Massey, the chief executive.        


         
Interview conducted and condensed by 

VIVIAN MARINO 
Q. Were you always interested in real estate? 
A. My real estate career actually started when I was in college. It was during my freshman year — I was a freshman at Wharton in 1981 and wanted to be the next Gordon Gekko and take over Wall Street. I grew up in northern New Jersey and drove around on spring break dropping my résumé off at every commercial and investment bank around. I came out of a Paine Webber office and across the hall I saw Coldwell Banker.        
I thought Coldwell Banker was a bank and I went in and dropped my résumé off. They called me later that day to set up an interview. So I go to the library to look up this “bank,” and when I see that it’s a real estate company I almost don’t go on the interview. But they were the only ones hiring college kids for the summer. I took the job, loved it from the first day.        
Q. What did you do there? 
A. It was on the commercial side, and I was in their databank program, where I was driving around Morris County, N.J., writing down information about commercial buildings.        
I went back my next two summers. My second summer, I ran the summer research program, and then my third summer, I was an assistant to a senior broker.        
Q. Then you became a broker. 
A. When I got out of school, I accepted a position in Manhattan with CB Richard Ellis and met Paul Massey my first day. CB had 60 brokers leasing office space and four who were selling buildings. Three of the four buildings people had 20 years of experience, and then there was Paul, who was right out of school. So the boss says “Hang out with Massey.” Day 2 on the job we realized the others weren’t going to acknowledge we were alive, so let’s team up together. That was almost 29 years ago.        
In ’86, ’87, ’88 we were the top sales people in the office and were actually made the directors of the sale division, so we became the bosses of those guys who didn’t want to talk to us when we started.        
Q. How do you divide up responsibilities at Massey Knakal? 
A. When we started, we both did everything together, including painting the first couple of offices and moving furniture. Over the years we kind of gravitated toward what we each like and believe that we do well. Paul runs the business. I’m involved in a very macro way in the management of the firm.        
I spend 95 percent of my time as a salesperson here. I love doing it. I still get as excited doing brokerage as I did when I started in the business.        
Q. You are the owner but you’re also competing with your employees as a broker. 
A. Not really. Mainly because of the platform that we have. First we only represent sellers. Second, we only work on exclusive listings and thirdly, we have a unique geographic orientation toward the business where we have one broker working in each neighborhood and they have certain protections in each of those areas, similar to the way franchises work. My territory is Hudson Yards and a small piece of Midtown.        
Q. Do you do much leasing? 
A. The firm, up until January 2011, only did property sales. Then we started a retail store leasing division and a mortgage brokerage division. But we’re still primarily a property sales company.        
Q. So how is business? 
A. Last year we did $2.6 billion in sales and we’re on pace to do about the same this year and in terms of the number of properties sold. I think we sold over 400 buildings last year and we’re on pace to surpass that this year.        
In 2007, at the peak of the market, there was about $62 billion of sales activity; that dropped to $6.2 billion in 2009. Last year it was up to $41 billion. So it’s been making a nice, steady comeback.        
Q. What’s been your biggest deal this year? 
A. We’ve done a couple that were in the $60-to-70-million range, and we have something that we’re working on now that will be over $100 million. Most of what we do as a firm is in that $2-million-to-50-million range. Ninety percent of the transactions in New York City are under $50 million; 87 percent are under $20 million.        
Q. And in your career? 
A. The sale of a portfolio of multifamily buildings for Harry Macklowe. It was $187 million transaction that closed in April ’03.        
Q. What’s your assessment of the commercial market in New York? 
A. I think it is very, very healthy, but I think that the downside risk relative to interest rates is very significant.        
Q. Do you personally invest in real estate? 
A. No. I think it’s a conflict of interest. I invest very conservatively.        
Q. You write a column in The Observer and are often on news shows. Do you worry about too much exposure? 
A. I think in our business being out there, so to speak, is very important to remain on top of people’s minds. So there’s no such thing as being overexposed.

ATLANTA — A clamorous football crowd can induce visiting squads into committing penalties by drowning out the signal calls.        


Full-throated basketball fans can nudge officiating in favor of the home team.        
But in no sport can devotees more directly influence the outcome than at a PGA Tour event. Such power can be exerted even if they are not present. All it takes is a television remote control with rewind capabilities, a cursory knowledge of the rules and the phone number to a given tournament’s host course.        
The tour permits anyone, even TV viewers, to submit evidence that a player might be guilty of an infraction — often with improperly improving the ball’s lie — that was not detected or reported by the player or others on the spot. One of the most prominent instances involved Tiger Woods, whose illegal drop at the Masters was spotted by a former rules official watching the tournament on television. Woods received a two-stroke penalty the next day.        
At the BMW Championship last weekend, Woods was assessed a two-shot penalty after the second round when his ball moved slightly as he removed debris behind the first green.        
This time, the informant was on the crew of PGA Tour Entertainment, the circuit’s video production wing.        
The tour’s commissioner, Tim Finchem, expressed concern Tuesday about the format’s fairness, in part because some players, like Woods, tend to be on TV more.        
Speaking at East Lake Golf Club, the site of this week’s Tour Championship finale, Finchem indicated that the tour’s policy board would discuss amending the procedure by possibly limiting the scope of information considered before declaring a result official.        
“All the other sports close their books quicker than we do, so to speak,” said Finchem, noting that he personally had no position on the matter.        
“I don’t like it sometimes,” he added. “It feels awkward when it happens.” Yet he alluded to golf’s foundation of adherence to the letter of the law, which has long held that no transgression should go unpunished.        
The seven-time tour winner Peter Jacobsen, who now divides his time between the Champions Tour and the TV announcers’ booth, endorsed the status quo Tuesday, even though he said that Woods unevenly bore the brunt of the custom.        
“When we have fans calling in after watching it on TV, it only strengthens the rules of the game and how good we have to be,” said Jacobsen, who received the Payne Stewart Award, which recognizes sportsmanship, character and charitable activities.        
“I don’t mind people calling in,” said Jacobsen, adding that integrity was “one of the measuring sticks out here on tour.”        
Finchem pointed out that the field could be leveled for all players if technology advances to where a camera is aimed at every shot. At the same time, tournament offices might require a phone bank to answer all of the calls about potential violations.        
The commissioner mentioned other adjustments the policy board might consider at its November meetings as the tour winds down.        
■ Reducing the penalty for inadvertently signing an incorrect scoreboard, which traditionally calls for disqualification. The issue has become complicated with the advent of TV watchers reporting perceived infractions.        
■ Toughening the penalty, generally at two strokes, for an individual’s slow play in the ongoing effort to accelerate the game’s pace.        
■ Altering the points formula for the FedEx Cup Playoffs, which culminate this weekend, to lessen the often drastic movement of players in the standings and to reward consistency during the long grind leading to it.        
“We like volatility,” Finchem said, “but it is too much volatility? You want the season to mean a lot.”

The Board of Elections acknowledged on Tuesday that, a week after the primary election for mayor of New York City, it still did not know when it would be able to release official results.        


The board has faced stinging criticism this week from the second-place finisher in the Democratic primary, William C. Thompson Jr., as well as the winner of the Republican primary, Joseph J. Lhota, who questioned the pace of the vote counting.        
But the executive director of the city’s Board of Elections, Michael J. Ryan, responded defiantly on Tuesday. Sounding frustrated, he said the board had compressed its usual vote-counting schedule, and suggested its critics were being unreasonable.        
“We’re making every effort to get final results to everyone as quickly as we possibly can,” Mr. Ryan said. “But our focus has to be accuracy.”        
Bill de Blasio emerged from primary night with just over the 40 percent threshold required to avoid a runoff for the Democratic nomination, but tens of thousands of paper ballots remain uncounted. Mr. Thompson conceded to Mr. de Blasio on Monday, saying the slow counting made it impossible for him to contest a runoff, but he said voters should be “outraged” that the final results of the primary were still not known.        
No matter what the official results show in the race for mayor, the city will hold a runoff election on Oct. 1 for the Democratic nomination for public advocate, because none of the candidates won more than 40 percent of the votes in that contest. If Mr. de Blasio were to drop below 40 percent in the official results for the Democratic mayoral primary, the city would also have to hold a runoff for that nomination, even though Mr. Thompson has said he would not contest it.        
The Board of Elections began double-checking the results from its lever voting machines last Friday, after retrieving the machines from polling places. The recanvassing of the machines has been completed, election officials said, but the board has not yet released adjusted numbers.        
On Monday, the board began reviewing the paper ballots. Absentee ballots postmarked no later than the day before the primary and received as late as Tuesday will still be counted.        
Mr. Ryan asserted that the counting of paper ballots was “on schedule,” but he declined to specify what the schedule was because he said he did not want to put “undue pressure” on his staff. He added that the board would not release any results for the recanvassing of the machines or the counting of paper ballots until each task was finished.        
“That’s the way it’s going to be, and that’s my decision,” he said. “I’ll quote Forrest Gump: ‘And that’s all I have to say about that.'”

In debates among the New York City mayoral candidates, there has been plenty of discussion about those responsible for the state of city schools, or the tactics of the Police Department. The name of George A. Fertitta, the man credited with luring millions of free-spending tourists to the city, has not come up.        


That is largely because it is hard to argue with the results of the tourism promotion effort he has led since the Bloomberg administration recruited him from Madison Avenue to be the chief executive of NYC & Company, the city’s marketing agency. On Tuesday, Mr. Fertitta forecast that the city would draw at least 53 million visitors in 2013 and was on pace to meet Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s goal of 55 million annual visitors by 2015.        
About six million of those tourists pass through Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street in Manhattan, and it is Mr. Fertitta’s mission to persuade them to scatter their vacation money around the city, particularly in other boroughs. So, on Wednesday morning, he and the chief executive of Macy’s, Terry J. Lundgren, will officially open a visitor center on the mezzanine level of the store that they say is a first: a collaboration between a retailer and a city tourism agency.        
Mr. Lundgren said the center would replace one whose primary purpose was to help shoppers from foreign countries navigate the large store. Macy’s has visitor centers in its main stores in several cities, including San Francisco and Chicago, as do other big retailers, like Harrods in London, he said.        
“Historically, we’ve primarily been focused on shopping in our stores,” Mr. Lundgren said. “It was, frankly, largely focused on our store and incentives,” he said, referring to discounts that Macy’s offers to customers who show foreign passports.        
Now, visitors will be able to ask for directions, make dinner reservations and buy tickets to other attractions. NYC & Company will staff the center and maintain the informational kiosks, but will pay no rent to Macy’s, Mr. Fertitta said. The agency receives commissions for the tickets it sells, money that helps cover its costs.        
NYC & Company has a presence in a storefront in Times Square and a visitor center of its own north of there on Seventh Avenue near 53rd Street. But Mr. Fertitta said the crowd that Macy’s draws “just seems irresistible.”        
As the police force has improved the city’s reputation for safety, he said, “so many neighborhoods are having visitors from all over the world just walking the streets.”        
“The Macy’s visitor center will give you places to walk to and places to see,” Mr. Fertitta said. As an example, he said, “when new attractions come online, like the Ferris wheel in Staten Island, we’ll be promoting them.”        
Despite its success in steadily increasing the number of people flocking to the city each year, the agency has had its city financing reduced, Mr. Fertitta said. He said that the city was providing just $13 million of NYC & Company’s current budget of $33 million. That allocation has declined from $21 million a few years ago, he said.        
He said that he hoped that cutback would be reversed by a new mayor.  “We have full expectation that whoever the next mayor is, they’ll embrace the travel and tourism industry,” Mr. Fertitta said.        
And he said he hoped to stay on to oversee the push to get to 55 million visitors.        
“I have no intentions of changing anything,” he said. “I don’t think we’re something that’s broken and needs to be fixed.”

Israel plans to allow building materials meant for private projects into the Gaza Strip for the first time in six years, an Israeli defense official said Tuesday. Gaza has been struggling with a shortage of building materials that has worsened since July, when the Egyptian military shut down many of the tunnels used to smuggle goods and weapons from Egypt into the Palestinian enclave. The Israeli official said that 350 trucks of cement, steel and concrete would cross into Gaza weekly. Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza in 2007 after the militant group Hamas seized control of the territory. Israel began to ease the blockade in 2010 under international pressure, and further eased restrictions at the end of last year.

A wave of car bombs rocked commercial streets in Baghdad on Tuesday, part of a series of attacks across the country that left 31 victims and 4 attackers dead. The bombings were believed to have been carried out by Sunnis aiming to undermine confidence in the Shiite-led government. Sunni leaders in Basra said gunmen had killed 17 Sunnis there over the past two weeks, after threats to retaliate against them for attacks on Shiites in other parts of Iraq. The surge of bloodshed is in its fifth month, although death tolls are still lower than at the height of the sectarian conflict from 2004 to 2008.

WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday that it had settled charges against a Florida company and its two top executives for sending more than 42 million unwanted and deceptive text messages to consumers.        


Messages sent by the company had promised free gift cards worth up to $1,000, the commission said, but when consumers tried to visit a Web site to collect the prize, they were instead connected to a site that asked for personal information, like Social Security numbers and credit card numbers. It also required them to pay for additional services to receive a gift card.        
The company, Rentbro, and its principals, Daniel Pessin and Jacob Engel, both of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., were required to turn over remaining assets and to repay up to $377,321, the amount the business had collected.        
The settlement came as part of a sweeping crackdown on text message fraud that the commission announced in March. The agency filed eight cases in February and March against 29 companies and individuals around the country, accusing them of sending text messages with fake offers.        
Those companies sent more than 180 million spam text messages, which typically offered gift cards to national chain stores like Best Buy and Walmart.        
C. Steven Baker, director of the commission’s Midwest region, said that since the agency had filed the cases, it had received many fewer complaints about such offers.        
The commission charged Rentbro and the two executives with unfair or deceptive acts, in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The parties agreed to the settlement but did not admit or deny wrongdoing.        
Gregg E. Pessin, a lawyer in Coral Gables, Fla., who is listed in Rentbro’s corporate filings as the company’s registered agent and who said he was the father of Mr. Pessin, said the company and the two men would not comment on the case.        
The Rentbro case was the second of the cases filed this year to be settled by the commission. In July, the agency assessed a penalty of $60,950 against Henry Nolan Kelly, who the commission said had sent more than 20 million unwanted text messages offering free iPads and iPhones to people who clicked on the Web link.        
The financial judgment against Mr. Kelly was suspended because of his inability to pay. He agreed to cooperate with the commission in future investigations and to refrain from sending unwanted or deceptive text messages.

The N.F.L. said it was raising the prices of the most expensive tickets for the Super Bowl in February at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Tickets for 9,000 premium seats will cost about $2,600 each, more than double the $1,250 price of similar tickets at last season’s Super Bowl in New Orleans.        


“We are looking to close the gap between the face value of the ticket and its true value as reflected on the secondary market,” Brian McCarthy, a spokesman, said Tuesday.        
Tickets for the next tier of seats are expected to cost $1,500 each, compared with $950 in New Orleans. About 40 percent of general admission seats will cost less than $1,000, McCarthy said. The capacity of MetLife Stadium is 82,000, but it will be reduced by about 5,000 seats to make room for members of the news media, cameras and security.        
The lowest-priced tickets will go down from $650 to $500. About 30,000 fans entered a lottery for those seats, and 1,000 winners will be notified this fall.        
In an effort to prevent the resale of those tickets above face value, the N.F.L. will require the winners to go to a gate to pick up the tickets as they enter the stadium.        
WAVE OF INJURIES FOR FALCONS Linebacker Sean Weatherspoon will be out for at least eight weeks and running back Steven Jackson will miss the Falcons’ next game and possibly more, the team said.        
Weatherspoon was the third starter to be placed on injured reserve after Atlanta’s 31-24 victory over the St. Louis Rams on Sunday.        
The Falcons had already placed defensive end Kroy Biermann and fullback Bradie Ewing on the reserve list.        
 GREENE HAS SURGERY Tennessee Titans Coach Mike Munchak said running back Shonn Greene had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. Greene, who was injured in the season opener against Pittsburgh, will be evaluated on a week-to-week basis.        
TRIAL SET IN REDSKIN’S KILLING An Oct. 15 trial date has been set for a man accused in the fatal shooting of Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor in 2007. The trial of the man, Eric Rivera Jr., 23, has been delayed numerous times, in part because Rivera has had several lawyers.        
The police said Taylor was shot during a botched robbery at his home near Miami. Rivera and four others were charged; one has pleaded guilty to murder and burglary charges. Rivera and the others are being tried separately.        
PANTHERS EXCHANGE SAFETIES Carolina signed safety Robert Lester from its practice squad and placed the veteran Charles Godfrey on injured reserve with a torn Achilles’ tendon.        
DENVER TACKLE OUT The Broncos’ All-Pro left tackle Ryan Clady has a sprained left foot and is expected to miss a significant amount of time.

NEW ORLEANS — Citing “grotesque prosecutorial misconduct” on the part of federal lawyers here and in Washington, a judge on Tuesday threw out the 2011 convictions of five former police officers who had been found guilty in a momentous civil rights case of killing two citizens and engaging in an extensive cover-up in the days after Hurricane Katrina.        


In a heated 129-page decision, Judge Kurt D. Englehardt of Federal District Court here declared that federal prosecutors had created a “prejudicial, poisonous atmosphere” in making anonymous online comments before and during the trial at nola.com, the Web site of The Times-Picayune, and ordered a new trial for all five officers.        
The decision represented the collapse, for now, of a case that was seen as symbolizing both the profound breakdown of law and order after the hurricane and a deep rot within the city’s police department that dated back well before the storm.         
While a scandal over anonymous online commenting had already cut short the federal careers of two local prosecutors and the United States attorney himself, Tuesday’s decision identified another, previously unknown commenter: a veteran lawyer in the Department of Justice in Washington who had a role in preparing the case for trial.        
“This case started as one featuring allegations of brazen abuse of authority, violation of the law and corruption of the criminal justice system,” the decision read. “Unfortunately though the focus has shifted from the accused to the accusers, it has continued to be about those very issues.”        
The vacating of the 2011 convictions, which were hailed by the city’s officials and by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., was another setback for a wide-ranging federal campaign to reform the New Orleans Police Department and hold some of its officers accountable for past abuse. A consent decree mandating full-scale departmental changes, announced with fanfare by the city and the Justice Department last summer, is now being appealed by city officials, who said they were unaware of the costs of a separate decree being negotiated that concerns the troubled city jail.        
The most notorious of several criminal investigations concerned the shootings on the Danziger Bridge on Sept 4, 2005, when the streets were still flooded and citizens were scavenging for basic supplies. Responding to a distress call, officers raced to the bridge and, according to testimony of witnesses, opened fire without warning, leaving four badly injured and James Brisette, 17, and Ronald Madison, a mentally disabled 40-year-old, dead. Trial witnesses described the cover-up that followed, beginning at the scene with the arrest of Ronald’s brother, Lance Madison.        
The case wound its way through the system, first falling apart in state court over grand jury improprieties before being taken over by federal prosecutors in 2008. Four officers — Kenneth Bowen, Robert Gisevius, Anthony Villavaso and Robert Faulcon — were eventually convicted in connection to the shooting itself. Another, former Detective Arthur Kaufman, was convicted for his part in the cover-up.        
Judge Englehardt, who declared a mistrial last year in the case of another officer involved in the Danziger case, had long been critical of the prosecution. At the defendants’ sentencing last year, the judge, an appointee of President George W. Bush, criticized federal prosecutors for the plea deals that had been offered to cooperating witnesses, among other things.        
Some of these criticisms were raised in Tuesday’s decision, but the main objections concerned the behavior of prosecutors online.        
That someone in the United States attorney’s office had been anonymously commenting on nola.com was first revealed in the spring of 2012 by lawyers representing the target of a high-profile corruption investigation. The revelations were the talk of New Orleans as lawyers identified a longtime assistant United States attorney, Sal Perricone, as a prolific and rather acerbic commenter under several handles. The targets of his commentary were varied and included the police department, which he called “corrupt,” “ineffectual” and “a joke.”        
Several months later, Jan Mann, the office’s second-highest-ranking prosecutor, was also revealed to have been commenting anonymously. In the wake of this disclosure, Jim Letten, at the time the longest-serving United States attorney in the country, stepped down.        
Neither Mr. Perricone nor Ms. Mann was a part of the federal trial prosecution team. But the defendants, citing Mr. Perricone’s extensive online comments about the case, had already requested a new trial.

Northwestern is 3-0 heading into Saturday’s game against Maine, with an offense averaging more than 43 points a game and a roster that is getting the right amount of sleep.        


Since Pat Fitzgerald became the coach in 2006, he has placed an unusual emphasis on his players’ sleeping behavior as a way to improve their performance. In the past, he has changed the times of practices and instituted team naps, but since the beginning of August, in collaboration with the university’s school of engineering, Fitzgerald has had his team undergo a sleep assessment. The idea is to assess the players’ sleep patterns and then suggest ways they can have more and sounder sleep.        
The players began wearing movement sensor armbands during training camp, except when they are practicing or in the weight room. The sensors have mainly been used to track the quantity and quality of sleep each player gets. Fitzgerald plans to have his players wear them throughout the rest of the season. Although players are not required to wear the sensors, most do.        
“At first, we didn’t really know much about sleep and we were just curious,” said defensive end Tyler Scott, a team captain. “But we really embraced it, and after a while, we got really competitive about sleep efficiency. We started checking our data every day.”        
The study has already had an effect.        
Before Northwestern’s season opener at California on Aug. 31, Fitzgerald shifted the team’s practice start times, nap times and meal times to a West Coast schedule in an attempt to minimize the effects of jet lag.        
The kickoff was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in California, which is 9:30 in Evanston, Ill. So the Wildcats began practices at 9:30 p.m., making bed time for most players sometime from 1 to 2 a.m. Fitzgerald did not hold any football activities in the early morning, allowing the players to sleep until 10 a.m.        
Emma Adam, a Northwestern professor and an expert on sleep in adolescents and young adults, said she had seen individuals log and study their own sleep patterns, but she has never seen an assessment done on this big a group of athletes.        
“What they’re doing is taking existing sleep research and translating it into a program designed for their athletes that they hope will improve not only athletic performance, but also a whole bunch of other things,” Adam said. “Sleep has effects on cognition, your attention, your memory, your mood, your metabolism, your appetite — it affects so many different things.”        
This is not the first time that Fitzgerald and his coaching staff have experimented with sleep schedules.        
Midway through last season, Fitzgerald noticed that his players appeared sluggish during an afternoon game. After conferring with a few players, he learned that many had been taking afternoon naps during the week because of their class schedules. Fitzgerald then implemented a mandatory nap time on game days.        
It was a source of jokes at first, but the players told Fitzgerald that the extra rest was beneficial. The results also were positive — the team finished 10-3, only the third time Northwestern had won at least 10 games.        
In 2007, Fitzgerald’s second year, he experimented with moving practice times from the afternoon to early in the morning.        
“We were one of the first and certainly probably one of the most high-profile to make that full commitment to morning practices,” said Tory Lindley, an associate athletic director and the director of athletic training services. “Since then, I’ve heard from a number of head athletic trainers around the country who have called us about our schedule and who have since moved and changed their schedules.”        
The result, Lindley said, was that the players were receiving better nutrition before and after practice, and that their performances were steadier and more predictable.        
Fitzgerald’s emphasis on sleep may still draw raised eyebrows from some. But he has more victories than any other football coach in Northwestern’s history, and the Wildcats figure to be a force in the Big Ten this season.        
That might be enough to prompt other teams to consider the possibilities of monitoring their players’ sleep patterns.        
“Through all the things that you have to do as a coach to try to help your guys perform at a high level and peak at the right time, we’re always trying to find ways to improve what we’re doing and what we’re teaching,” he said, “and this is kind of the new frontier.”

Mexico began airlifting hundreds of stranded tourists to Mexico City from Acapulco on Tuesday after a tropical storm flooded highways, the airport and some hotels at the faded and violent Pacific resort town. It was another blow to the city, once a playground for the Hollywood set but now struggling to overcome organized crime violence and a passé reputation. Days of heavy rain from the storm, as well as another on the Gulf Coast, have sent rivers of mud cascading through scores of cities and villages on both coasts, leaving an estimated 47 people dead and thousands homeless, one of the highest storm tolls in Mexico in recent years. Although many hotels in Acapulco were undamaged, some began rationing food and other provisions because of power failures and the inability of workers or trucks to get through flooded streets on the outskirts to supply them.

A man accused of detonating a bomb this summer in Beijing Capital International Airport pleaded not guilty on Tuesday. The man, Ji Zhongxing, had not intended to set off an explosive, his lawyer said, according to online reports of the trial. No one was injured in the blast, which took place on July 20, except Mr. Ji, and he was wheeled into the courtroom on Tuesday on a stretcher. Mr. Ji had been trying to call attention to grievances against officials in the southern city of Dongguan, whom he accused of having beaten him. Police officers tried to stop Mr. Ji from carrying out his protest, which unfolded in Terminal 3, before the explosion took place. Mr. Ji’s case elicited widespread sympathy among Chinese Internet users, who accuse the government of hassling rather than helping petitioners like Mr. Ji.

On many days, Alpha Manzueta gets off from one job at 7 a.m., only to start her second at noon. In between she goes to a place she’s called home for the last three years — a homeless shelter.        


“I feel stuck,” said Ms. Manzueta, 37, who has a 2 ½-year-old daughter and who, on a recent Wednesday, looked crisp in her security guard uniform, waving traffic away from the curb at Kennedy International Airport. “You try, you try and you try and you’re getting nowhere. I’m still in the shelter.”        
With New York City’s homeless population in shelters at a record high of 50,000, a growing number of New Yorkers punch out of work and then sign in to a shelter, city officials and advocates for the homeless say. More than one out of four families in shelters, 28 percent, include at least one employed adult, city figures show, and 16 percent of single adults in shelters hold jobs.        
Mostly female, they are engaged in a variety of low-wage jobs as security guards, bank tellers, sales clerks, computer instructors, home health aides and office support staff members. At work they present an image of adult responsibility, while in the shelter they must obey curfews and show evidence that they are actively looking for housing and saving part of their paycheck.        
Advocates of affordable housing say that the employed homeless are proof of the widening gap between wages and rents — which rose in the city even during the latest recession — and, given the shortage of subsidized housing, of just how difficult it is to escape the shelter system, even for people with jobs.        
“A one-bedroom in East New York or the South Bronx is still $1,000 a month,” said Patrick Markee, senior policy analyst with the Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy and housing services group. “The jobs aren’t enough to get people out of homelessness.”        
David Garza, executive director of Henry Street Settlement, which runs three family shelters and one shelter for single women with mental illnesses, said that five years ago his shelters were placing 200 families a year into permanent housing. Last year, he said, they placed 50.        
“Without low-income housing, it’s a maze with no way out,” Mr. Garza said.        
The employed homeless are constantly juggling the demands of their two worlds.        
A 45-year-old woman named Barbara, who works part time as a public transit customer service representative, said she had to keep items like razors and nail clippers at a storage center because they were not allowed in the shelter for security reasons.        
Sometimes she takes a tote bag filled with dirty clothes to work to take to the laundromat afterward, she said, because the machines at the shelter are always either broken or being used.        
But, she said, there is no escaping the noise and fitful sleep of a dormitory shared with eight other women.        
Like most homeless employed people interviewed for this article, Barbara did not want to be identified by her full name for fear of losing her privacy or her job. She has been homeless since 2011, she said, when her unemployment insurance ran out and she could no longer afford her apartment in Brooklyn. No one at work knows, she said.        
“When it comes to the professional arena, I want people to think that I got it together, that I’m not living paycheck to paycheck, that my only option isn’t to buy secondhand,” she said.        
Sometimes homeless workers discover one another.        
Deirdre Cunningham, 21, who works two part-time jobs — as a bank teller and as a sales clerk for an electronics store in Manhattan, said that at one point a co-worker at the store invited her to an evening event. “I said, ‘I can’t go, because I have curfew,’ and this co-worker said, ‘What do you mean curfew?’ ”        
“I said, ‘I live in a shelter,’ and she said, ‘I do, too.’ ”        
Ms. Cunningham, who has a 4-year-old daughter, said she has always been open about her struggles. “A lot of people have problems, too,” she said.        
She said she left her parents’ home in the South Bronx in 2011 because she did not want to expose her daughter to “family issues.” Two years and three shelters later, she moved in August into her own $900-a-month one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx with the help of a rent subsidy from the Coalition for the Homeless. But the aid lasts for only two years.

We can draw three lessons from the arrival of Apple’s two new iPhone models, the 5C and 5S.        


LESSON 1 Apple may have set its own bar for innovation too high.        
Year after year, Steve Jobs used to blow our minds with products we didn’t know we wanted. Now, two years after his death, we still expect every new iPhone to clean our gutters, cook our popcorn and levitate. So when the hardware revisions are minor each year, we’re disappointed.        
And sure enough, after Apple showed off its two new iPhone models last week, its stock dropped. Analysts shrugged that they contain nothing “transformative.” The blogger-haters had a field day.        
The budget model, the new iPhone 5C, comes in five colors ($100 for the 16-gigabyte model with a two-year contract, $550 without). It’s essentially identical to last year’s iPhone 5, except that its back and sides are a single piece of plastic instead of metal and glass.        
Actually, “plastic” isn’t quite fair. The 5C’s case is polycarbonate, lacquered like a glossy piano. Better yet, its back edges are curved for the first time since the iPhones of 2008. You can tell by touch which way it’s facing in your pocket.        
It’s a terrific phone. The price is right. It will sell like hot cakes; the new iPhones go on sale Friday. But just sheathing last year’s phone in shiny plastic isn’t a stunning advance.        
LESSON 2 The smartphone is mature.        
The App Store filled a huge hole. Siri voice command answered a desperate need. And high-resolution Retina displays helped compensate for the tiny screen.        
But today, every phone has that stuff; the big holes have been plugged. Maybe the age of annual mega-leaps is over.        
The new 5S ($200 with contract, $650 without) looks exactly like last year’s thin and gorgeous iPhone 5. You can now get it with its brushed aluminum body in dark gray (with black glass accents), silver (white accents) or a surprisingly classy-looking gold (white accents).        
Apple says the 5S’s chip is twice as fast as before. Nobody was exactly complaining about the iPhone’s speed before, but, sure, it’s plenty quick. Since it’s a 64-bit chip, Apple says the graphics in 3-D video games look especially smooth and detailed.        
There’s also a second chip devoted to tracking motion data from the phone’s compass, gyroscope and tilt sensor. Apple says this coprocessor should save battery life when you use fitness tracking apps, because it can monitor your data all day long; the main chip, which requires six times as much power, can remain asleep.        
Those are both fairly invisible changes, though.        
The new camera will mean more to you. Its sensor is 15 percent bigger, and the individual light-detecting pixels are bigger. Take photos side-by-side with the iPhone 5S’s predecessor, and the difference is immediately obvious; lowlight pictures are far better on the new phone. Clearer, brighter, better color.        
The 5S also has two LED flashes — one pure white, one amber — that fire simultaneously. When mixed in the right balance, their light can match the color tone of your subject (moonlight, streetlights, fluorescents, whatever). Apple says this idea is a first in both phones and cameras.        
It really works. Flash photos look much, much better. No longer will your loved ones’ skin look either nuclear white or “Avatar” blue.        
The 5S’s camera also offers a burst mode (10 frames a second), 3X zooming during video capture, Instagram-style photo filters and truly wowing slow-motion video. (Weirdly, filtered photos and slo-mo videos don’t survive the transfer to your computer, although you can send them by e-mail or text message.) Sample photos and videos accompany this column online.        
The most heavily promoted feature is the 5S’s fingerprint sensor, which, ingeniously, is built into the Home button. You push the Home button to wake the phone, leave your finger there another half second, and boom: you’ve unlocked a phone that nobody else can unlock, without the hassle of inputting the password. (And yes, a password is a hassle; half of smartphone users never bother setting one up.)

During this year’s World Baseball Classic, Cuba’s Jose Dariel Abreu hit a grand slam against China that was positively jaw-dropping. Abreu, a powerfully built right-handed hitter, loaded up on his back leg, waited on a curveball and hit a towering drive halfway up the outfield stands. Thirty major league front offices were surely paying attention.        


Last month, Abreu defected from Cuba, the latest player to leave the nation to pursue a major league career. Yasiel Puig’s electric summer in Los Angeles for the Dodgers and Yoenis Cespedes’s success with the Oakland Athletics the past two seasons have helped to fuel the hype surrounding Abreu’s imminent arrival in the majors. It is possible that when Abreu does sign, his deal will be the richest of any Cuban defector, topping Puig’s $42 million.        
“There is more and more interest in the Cuban players all the time,” said the agent Jaime Torres, who represents Puig. “Look how well they are doing.”        
Still, Abreu is a player who has spent his career hidden from most major league scouts and has essentially been competing against hard-to-evaluate opponents. He could be the next great Cuban star, or merely the beneficiary of a bull market for Cuban players. There is little certainty either way.        
Abreu, 26, stands 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 250 pounds. He is a first baseman with ample power, but also a sharp batting eye and the ability to hit for a high average. The numbers he put up in Cuba’s Serie Nacional are staggering.        
In the 2009-10 season, Abreu rose to stardom when he hit .399 with 30 home runs, 76 runs batted in and a .555 on-base percentage. The next year he had one of the best seasons in the history of the Cuban league, batting .453 with 33 home runs and 93 R.B.I. in only 66 games (he missed 23 with bursitis in his shoulder).        
His past two seasons have been similarly prodigious. At the World Baseball Classic this year, he was 9 for 25 with 3 home runs in 6 games.        
Abreu is often called a four-tool player, missing only the speed of his countrymen Puig and Cespedes. Scouts have compared him to Ryan Howard because of his size and easy power. Peter Bjarkman, who covers the Cuban league for baseballdecuba.com, said Abreu had the look of a young Mark McGwire.        
Adding to his value, Abreu will be part of a relatively thin free-agent class in the major leagues. So far, the San Francisco Giants have expressed interest, as have the Boston Red Sox, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Baltimore Orioles. The Mets, still looking for an impact hitter at first base, would also make an intriguing landing spot.        
Ike Davis, once thought to be the Mets’ first baseman of the future, spent time at Class AAA Las Vegas this season and was recently shelved with an oblique injury. Neither of his replacements, Lucas Duda and Josh Satin, inspires much confidence as a long-term solution. Abreu could be a quick — albeit expensive — fix should General Manager Sandy Alderson decide he is up for a somewhat risky bidding war.        
But Abreu is hardly a guarantee at the major league level. An international scout for one major league team said that Alfredo Despaigne and Frederich Cepeda, outfielders on the Cuban national team, were more dangerous hitters.        
An international scout for another team said that major league clubs could not afford to make a mistake when spending big on a first baseman, since it is a traditional power position filled by players who bat in the middle of the lineup. In other words, the scout said, the same money that could be used to sign Abreu might be better spent in the acquisition of one of the many established first basemen “you already know can hit big league pitching.”        
Neither scout wanted to be quoted by name discussing a player his team might end up bidding on.        
Bjarkman noted that Abreu’s prodigious numbers came in a league that is leaking talent, as more and more players leave the country. Some pitchers in Cuba, he said, throw between 80 and 85 miles per hour, which is almost akin to batting practice in the majors.        
“His numbers in the Cuban league are great, but they came against some very mediocre pitching,” Bjarkman said. “For the national team, he dropped off a bit. If there is a question, it’s whether he can adjust as quickly to the better pitching as the Cuban players who have been so good in the majors.”        
Sigfredo Barros, a baseball writer for the Cuban newspaper Granma, said: “Sometimes it can be very hard to tell with the Cuban players. Not everyone can be Puig.”        
Right now, Abreu is working to establish residency in Haiti so he can legally work in the United States. If he came directly he could work immediately, but he would have been subject to the amateur draft and deprived of his lucrative free agency.        
In addition, Major League Baseball’s new interpretation of regulations from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control means Abreu will face a longer wait before he is cleared. In the past, Cuban defectors needed only to prove permanent residency in a country outside Cuba. Now baseball requires players to petition the Foreign Assets office, a process that can take several months.        
Praver Shapiro Sports Management, which has handled other Cubans like pitcher Livan Hernandez, will represent Abreu. Last summer, the agency negotiated a nine-year, $30 million contract for another Cuban client, Jorge Soler, who signed with the Chicago Cubs.        
Abreu is expected to have a showcase for scouts in the Dominican Republic this month, at which point the hype will probably grow. Where it leads remains to be seen.

WASHINGTON — The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on Tuesday offered its most extensive public explanation for why it has allowed the government to keep records of all Americans’ phone calls, releasing a previously classified  opinion in which it said the program was constitutional and did not violate Americans’ privacy rights.        


While the once-secret call log program has been periodically reapproved by the court since 2006, it has come under criticism from members of Congress of both parties and civil libertarians since its existence came to public light in June after leaks by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden.        
In a 29-page opinion that quoted the N.S.A. director, Keith Alexander, as saying the leaks had caused “significant and irreversible damage” to national security, Judge Claire V. Eagan, a federal judge in the Northern District of Oklahoma, declared that the program was lawful. So, she wrote, any decision about whether to keep it was a political question, not a legal one.        
“This court is mindful that this matter comes before it at a time when unprecedented disclosures have been made about this and other highly sensitive programs designed to obtain foreign intelligence information and carry out counterterrorism investigations,” she wrote, adding: “In the wake of these disclosures, whether and to what extent the government seeks to continue the program discussed in this memorandum opinion is a matter for the political branches to decide.”        
The opinion by Judge Eagan — a 2001 appointee of President George W. Bush who was assigned to the surveillance court by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. this year — also noted that no telecommunications company had invoked its legal right to object to turning over its customers’ calling records to the government.        
“To date, no holder of records who has received an order to produce bulk telephony metadata has challenged the legality of such an order,” she wrote.        
The opinion, dated Aug. 29, was the first written since the program came to light. While other judges had routinely reauthorized the program every 90 days with only brief reiteration of the court’s legal analysis, according to an official familiar with the still-classified rulings, Judge Eagan wrote the lengthier memorandum apparently for the purpose of public release.        
Judge Eagan noted in her opinion that the court had previously reauthorized the program to continue for another three months on July 19 after having held an “extensive hearing to receive testimony and evidence on this matter.” In a footnote, she said that only the government, and not opponents of the program, participated in the hearing, as is routine for such proceedings.        
James R. Clapper, the director of national intelligence, lauded the opinion as one that “affirms that the bulk telephony metadata collection is both lawful and constitutional.” In a statement, he said its release was consistent with President Obama’s call “for more transparency on these valuable intelligence programs.”        
But Jameel Jaffer, a senior attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, called the opinion “completely unpersuasive,” criticizing it for failing to mention a landmark privacy case decided by the Supreme Court last year and portraying its statutory analysis as “equally weak.”        
“On the whole, the opinion only confirms the folly of entrusting privacy rights to a court that hears argument only from the government,” he said.        
The legal analysis Judge Eagan endorsed echoes the basic arguments that the Obama administration has made in defending the program since it came to light, including in an unsigned Justice Department “white paper“ it released last month.        
Among those arguments was that phone call metadata — phone numbers, time and duration of calls, but not content — is not protected by Fourth Amendment privacy rights because it does not involve eavesdropping on the content of calls.        
She also agreed that the government has legal authority to collect all calling records from phone companies under a provision of the Patriot Act that allows it to obtain business records deemed “relevant” to an investigation; and that members of Congress had had an opportunity to learn how the Patriot Act was secretly being interpreted before lawmakers reauthorized the law.        
The program traces its origins to one aspect of the Bush administration’s expansion of surveillance outside statutory or judicial frameworks after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It was later brought under the authority of the surveillance court and linked to the Patriot Act.        
The security agency uses the database to perform “link analysis” seeing who may have been in contact — directly or indirectly — with terrorism suspects, in hopes of identifying hidden cells. Under rules imposed by the court, the agency may search for phone calls only if there is “reasonable, articulable suspicion” that the underlying phone number is linked to terrorism.        
In explaining why the court had reauthorized the program, Judge Eagan said that “according to the government” there were no “compliance incidents” — violations of the rules limiting how the database may be accessed by analysts — in the previous three-month period.        
Last week, the government released documents by another judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to a 2009 reprimand of the security agency for violating the rules and for misleading the court about how it was using the database. It had come to light that the agency was automatically comparing each day’s fresh batch of phone data with an “alert list” of thousands of numbers its analysts had flagged, only about 10 percent of which met the standard of the court-imposed rules.        
“The court is aware that in prior years there have been incidents of noncompliance with respect to N.S.A.’s handling of produced information,” Judge Eagan wrote. “Through oversight by this court over a period of months, those issues were resolved.”

THE Census Bureau reported yesterday that the poverty rate in America held stable between 2011 and 2012, at about 15 percent. According to the official measure, poverty today is higher than it was in 1973, when it reached a historical low of 11.1 percent.        


To many, this dismaying fact suggests that taxpayers waste billions of dollars a year fighting a war on poverty that has been largely lost. As Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said earlier this year, “We have spent $15 trillion from the federal government fighting poverty, and look at where we are, the highest poverty rates in a generation, 15 percent of Americans in poverty.”        
But this position is wrong, for two reasons. The first is that the official measure is misleading — it measures only cash income, and it does not count benefits from many programs that help the poor. If they were counted, the rate would be closer to 11 percent.        
Consider the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, which was first put into nationwide use in the 1960s. The immediate benefits are easy to calculate: a dollar of SNAP subsidies spent on food frees up a dollar for low-income families to spend on rent, utilities or other needs. When SNAP benefits are counted as income, they lift almost four million people above the poverty line.        
And SNAP benefits not only reduce food insecurity and poverty this year; they also reduce poverty in the next generation. Recent research that tracked children into adulthood found that families’ access to food stamps improved their infants’ health and birth weight. Children who benefited from the program later posted better health, higher educational attainment, less heart disease and, for women, greater earnings and less reliance on welfare as adults.        
The earned-income tax credit is also ignored in calculating the poverty rate. Yet this program offers working low-income families with children about $3,000 a year. When these tax refunds are counted, they reduce the number of people in poverty by about 5.5 million people.        
Social Security benefits are counted in the official measure, but their large antipoverty effect receives little attention. Without these benefits, the elderly poverty rate would have been more than 44 percent, instead of the actual rate of less than 9 percent.        
The next time critics of the safety net claim that we fought a war on poverty and poverty won, remind them that without these and other programs, poverty would be much higher.        
But, says the critic, if all these programs have such broad effects, why has the poverty rate stayed so frustratingly stable? That’s the second flaw in the conventional wisdom.        
All things being equal, such programs, whether we count them or not, should have reduced the official poverty rate across generations. But all things have not been equal. Although these programs help the poor, poverty remains high because inequality of economic outcomes has increased sharply since the 1970s.        
Before income inequality took off, the poverty rate fell more rapidly with G.D.P. growth. But while the economy grew by 2.8 percent in 2012 and corporate profits went up as a share of national income, the earnings of full-time workers, median household income and the poverty rate barely changed.        
Antipoverty programs do help, but their recipients don’t move forward because they no longer benefit much from that other great poverty-ameliorating factor, economic growth.        
That’s not to say that growth is no longer necessary for reducing poverty. But in our gilded age of inequality, growth alone is insufficient.        
A few changes would make a difference. First, a poverty measure that incorporated all anti-poverty policies would show that the safety net is more effective than critics say, and would show how painful cuts to those programs could be.        
In fact, the Census Bureau has already developed a supplemental measure that reveals the importance of these programs to low-income families. But when it is released next month, it will receive far less attention than the official rate from policy makers and the press.        
Second, more benefits from growth must reach the poor, and the best way to do that is through matching robust antipoverty measures with policies that lower the unemployment rate and increase wages. During the full employment years of the late 1990s, even low wages rose in step with productivity, and poverty fell more sharply than it had in a generation. A minimum-wage increase helped then, and an increase now would help again.        
Lowering poverty means both recognizing the successes of safety net programs we now have and devising new policies that can spread the gains generated by economic growth. If we don’t, then we will continue to face poverty rates that are unacceptably high, and wonder why we can’t do anything about them.

Editorial,"










I was at a conference in Bern, Switzerland, last week and struggling with my column. News of Russia’s proposal for Syria to surrender its poison gas was just breaking and changing every hour, forcing me to rewrite my column every hour. To clear my head, I went for a walk along the Aare River, on Schifflaube Street. Along the way, I found a small grocery shop and stopped to buy some nectarines. As I went to pay, I was looking down, fishing for my Swiss francs, and when I looked up at the cashier, I was taken aback: He had pink hair. A huge shock of neon pink hair — very Euro-punk from the ’90s. While he was ringing me up, a young woman walked by, and he blew her a kiss through the window — not a care in the world.        


Observing all this joie de vivre, I thought to myself: “Wow, wouldn’t it be nice to be a Swiss? Maybe even to sport some pink hair?” Though I can’t say for sure, I got the feeling that the man with pink hair was not agonizing over the proper use of force against Bashar al-Assad. Not his fault; his is a tiny country. I guess worrying about Syria is the tax you pay for being an American or an American president — and coming from the world’s strongest power that still believes, blessedly in my view, that it has to protect the global commons. Barack Obama once had black hair. But his is gray now, not pink. That’s also the tax you pay for thinking about the Middle East too much: It leads to either gray hair or no hair, but not pink hair.        
Well, bring on the Grecian Formula, because our leaders will need it. My big take-away from the whole Syria imbroglio is that — with Europe ailing, China AWOL and the Arab world convulsing — for an American president to continue to lead will require more help from Vladimir Putin, because our president will get less help from everyone else, including the American people. Everyone is focusing on Obama’s unimpressive leadership in this crisis, but for my money the two main players who shaped the outcome — in ways that would not have been predicted but will have huge long-term implications — were Putin and the American people. Obama got blindsided by both. What does it tell us?        
The fact that Americans overwhelmingly told Congress to vote against bombing Syria for its use of poison gas tells how much the divide on this issue in America was not left versus right, but top versus bottom. Intervening in Syria was driven by elites and debated by elites. It was not a base issue. I think many Americans could not understand why it was O.K. for us to let 100,000 Syrians die in a civil war/uprising, but we had to stop everything and bomb the country because 1,400 people were killed with poison gas. I and others made a case why, indeed, we needed to redraw that red line, but many Americans seemed to think that all we were doing is drawing a red line in a pool of blood. Who would even notice?        
Many Americans also understood that when it came to our record in the Arab/Muslim world since 9/11, we were 0 for 3. Afghanistan seems headed for failure; whatever happens in Iraq, it was overpaid for; and Libya saw a tyrant replaced by tribal wars. I also think a lot of people look at the rebels in Syria and hear too few people who sound like Nelson Mandela — that is, people fighting for the right to be equal citizens, not just for the triumph of their sect or Shariah. It’s why John McCain’s soaring interventionist rhetoric was greeted with a “No Sale.” I also think the public picked up on Obama’s ambivalence — his Churchillian, this-must-not-stand rhetoric, clashed with his “On second thought, I’m going to ask Congress’s permission before I make a stand, and I won’t call lawmakers back from vacation to do so.” The bombing was going to be bigger than a “pinprick” but also “unbelievably small.” It just did not add up.        
Finally, there was an “Are you kidding?” question lurking beneath it all — a sense that with middle-class incomes stagnating, income gaps widening and unemployment still pervasive for both white- and blue-collar workers, a lot of Americans were asking: “This is the emergency you are putting before Congress? Syria? Really? This is the red line you want to draw? I’m out of work, but this Syria thing is what shall not stand?”        
As for Putin, if he had not intervened with his proposal to get Syria to surrender all its chemical weapons, Obama would have had to either bomb Syria without Congressional approval or slink away. So why did Putin save Obama? In part, no doubt, because he felt the only way he could save his client, the Syrian president, was by also saving the American president. But the bigger factor is that Putin really wants to be seen as a big, relevant global leader. It both feeds his ego and plays well with his base. The question now is: With the American people sidelined and Putin headlined, can we leverage Putin’s intervention to join us in also forging a cease-fire in Syria and maybe even move on to jointly try to end the Iran nuclear crisis.        
I agree with Obama on this: no matter how we got here, we’re in a potentially better place. So let’s press it. Let’s really test how far Putin will go with us. I’m skeptical, but it’s worth a try. Otherwise, Obama’s hair will not just be turned gray by the Middle East these next three years, he’ll go bald.

Representative Aaron Schock is a conservative Republican from Illinois, but not conservative enough for the hard-right activist group Club for Growth, which is seeking someone to run against him in next year’s primary.        


His crime? In 2011, he voted to increase the debt ceiling, and, in 2012, he voted for a stopgap spending bill that prevented a government shutdown. In neither case did he demand the defunding of health care reform.        
Club for Growth and other extremist groups consider a record like his an unforgivable failure, and they are raising and spending millions to make sure that no Republicans will take similar positions in the next few weeks when the fiscal year ends and the debt limit expires.        
If you’re wondering why so many House Republicans seem to believe they can force President Obama to accept a “defunding” of the health care reform law by threatening a government shutdown or a default, it’s because these groups have promised to inflict political pain on any Republican official who doesn’t go along.        
Heritage Action and the Senate Conservatives Fund have each released scorecards showing which lawmakers have pledged to “defund Obamacare.” When a senator like Tom Coburn of Oklahoma refuses to pledge, right-wing activists are told: “Please contact Senator Coburn and tell him it’s dishonest to say you oppose Obamacare, but then vote to fund it. Tell him he swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution.”        
Mr. Schock and 10 other lawmakers considered suspiciously squishy by the Club for Growth were designated as RINO’s (Republicans in name only), and the club has vowed to find primary opponents and support them with cash — a formidable threat considering that it spent $18 million backing conservative candidates in the 2012 cycle. Americans for Prosperity, a Koch brothers group that has already spent millions on ads fighting health reform, is beginning a new campaign to delay the law’s effects.        
These groups, all financed with secret and unlimited money, feed on chaos and would like nothing better than to claim credit for pushing Washington into another crisis. Winning an ideological victory is far more important to them than the severe economic effects of a shutdown or, worse, a default, which could shatter the credit markets.        
They also have another reason for their attacks: fund-raising. All their Web sites pushing the defunding scheme include a big “donate” button for the faithful to push. “With your donation, you will be sending a strong message: Obamacare must be defunded now,” says the Web site of the National Liberty Federation, another “social welfare” group that sees dollar signs in shutting down the government.        
Brian Walsh, a longtime Republican operative, recently noted in U.S. News and World Report that the right is now spending more money attacking Republicans than the Democrats are. “Money begets TV ads, which begets even more money for these groups’ personal coffers,” he wrote. “Pointing fingers and attacking Republicans is apparently a very profitable fund-raising business.”        
It may be good for their bank accounts, but the combination of unlimited money and rigid ideology is proving toxic for the most basic functioning of government.

It has been just over 100 days since the disturbing disclosure of the government’s vast and continuing sweep of Americans’ phone and Internet records, authorized by Congress and approved by a secret court issuing secret opinions on critical elements of constitutional law.        


Since then, the debate over the balance between national security and individual privacy has evolved rapidly with each new disclosure from Edward Snowden. Take the words of the director of national intelligence, James Clapper Jr., who in March denied to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the government was collecting the very data we now know it has been collecting for years.        
After the surveillance was exposed, Mr. Clapper made the Orwellian claim that his earlier denial was the “least untruthful” response he could give in light of the classified nature of the programs. Last week, Mr. Clapper told a roomful of intelligence contractors that the conversation triggered by Mr. Snowden’s leaks “actually needed to happen,” and may represent a “good side” to what intelligence officials consider a calamitous security breach.        
Conversation is meaningless, of course, without information, and there, too, some progress is being made — including a remarkable ruling last week by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.        
The court ordered the government to review for possible release the court’s opinions about the phone-records program. The leaks, along with court opinions and orders the government has since declassified, have “engendered considerable public interest and debate” about the interpretation and application of specific provisions of the Patriot Act, Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV wrote.        
Further publication of court rulings “would contribute to an informed debate,” the judge added, particularly about whether the laws should be changed (or, we would add, the programs themselves). Judge Saylor is not alone. On Tuesday afternoon, the court declassified an August opinion by Judge Claire Eagan, authorizing another sweep of telephone data. Judge Eagan had requested that the ruling be released because of “public interest.”        
The release of judicial opinions would not normally be notable in a constitutional democracy premised on open courts, but the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has been anything but normal. The government is justified in classifying certain information regarding national security operations, but, in most cases, there is no good rationale for the classification of judicial interpretations of law. The government’s argument that the legal analysis is “inextricably intertwined” with secrets may be true in some cases, but its blanket invocation has weakened its strength. Last week, Judge Saylor wrote that further publication of the court’s orders “would also assure citizens of the integrity of this court’s proceedings.” We will not know until we see behind the curtain.

The coal industry and its allies are angry about President Obama’s energy policies, and they have decided to take it out on his nominee to lead the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas and oil.        


The commission has no regulatory authority over coal. But that doesn’t matter to the industry. It has come out against Ronald Binz, the nominee, because he supported clean fuels when he was a state energy regulator.        
As the chairman of the Colorado Public Utility Commission, he helped Colorado lawmakers tighten standards on coal-fired power plants, causing some older plans to shut down and be replaced by natural gas plants. Those new rules are helping to reduce emissions and improve the state’s air quality. One of the coal industry’s chief complaints against Mr. Binz is that he overstepped his authority in his Colorado post; they refuse to acknowledge that a court ruled against that claim.        
Mr. Binz’s critics, which include the far right and some Senate Republicans, want to block his appointment because they say he would encourage the construction of transmission lines that will bring power generated by wind farms to urban areas.        
They also argue that he would undermine conventional fossil fuels by standing in the way of new oil and gas pipelines. His record, however, shows he is no ideologue.        
The coal lobby and the American Energy Alliance, which is partly financed by the Koch brothers, are hoping that their misleading campaign against Mr. Binz will convince some Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana to oppose his nomination. Senators should ignore the attacks from vested special interests, many of whom deny the existence of climate change, and confirm Mr. Binz.

The overuse of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture has long been known to foster the emergence of germs that are resistant to drugs. On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the first solid numbers on the extent of the problem. It said that at least two million Americans fall ill from antibiotic-resistant infections each year, of whom at least 23,000 die from the infections, a very conservative estimate.        


The agency warned of “potentially catastrophic consequences” unless prompt action is taken. It said that up to half of the antibiotics prescribed for people are not needed or appropriately used (as when a broad spectrum antibiotic is used instead of a more targeted drug).        
Overuse of antibiotics on farms, where they are often used to promote growth and prevent disease in healthy animals, also contributes to development of resistant strains of germs.        
The new report, for the first time, puts 17 drug-resistant bacteria and a dangerous fungus into three categories based on how big a threat they pose. Three were deemed “urgent threats,” including a bacterium, known as CRE, that is resistant to most drugs and kills a high percentage of people who become infected with it. Though it is rare, causing 600 deaths a year, it has been identified in health facilities in 44 states. Further spread of the germ or transfer of its resistance genes to other germs could lead to a “nightmare scenario,” the agency said. Twelve drug-resistant strains, including such common germs as salmonella, tuberculosis and MRSA, were classified as “serious threats.”        
Unless prompt action is taken to reduce overuse, track and prevent the spread of resistance, and develop new drugs, the C.D.C.’s director, Thomas Frieden, warned, “the medicine cabinet may be empty for patients with life-threatening infections in the coming months and years.”

SAN FRANCISCO — Officially, there was no action in the America’s Cup on Tuesday. The combination of a strong ebb tide and wind in San Francisco Bay forced officials to cancel both scheduled races.        


That means the challenger, Emirates Team New Zealand, still has a 7-1 lead and still needs just two victories to win the oldest major trophy in global sport from Oracle Team USA.        
But unofficially, there is always action at this sink-or-swim stage of the Cup, which, even after 162 years, has the highest profile and highest stakes of any sailing event.        
Win it, and a team gets everything that matters, including the chance to stage the next Cup where it chooses and, to a large degree, how it chooses. Lose it, and a team becomes just another prospective challenger — at the mercy of the winds and whims of the defender.        
Given the many millions of dollars that the Oracle owner, Larry Ellison, has lavished on this Cup so far for so little reward or public appreciation, challenging or even abstaining might seem a better business plan at this stage.        
But there still does not appear to be another winner-take-all formula quite as extreme as the America’s Cup in elite sport, and although the interviews on the dock were cordial and coherent Tuesday, the sailors and the big, specialized teams that support them all know that their jobs are likely to end if the Cup ends in defeat.        
Oracle Team employees continue to talk comeback, citing Australia II’s rally from a 1-3 deficit against Liberty in the 1983 Cup, which ended the Americans’ 132-year winning streak.        
But the odds remain heavily in Team New Zealand’s favor, and on Tuesday in the America’s Cup Park at Pier 27, the end felt near with 50 percent discounts on all America’s Cup apparel in the official store and with fans snapping up hats and shirts before snapping images of the two 72-foot catamarans as their crews prepared to dock out (to no avail).        
With their huge wing sails, surprisingly thin in profile, mirroring the verticals of Coit Tower and the Transamerica Pyramid in the distance, it was an evocative scene. A peaceful scene, too, with the sunlight playing tricks with the undulations in the water.        
But peaceful is far from the mood behind the scenes. Team New Zealand, with significant government money but no guarantee of more, needs the victory to guarantee its survival. Oracle Team USA, with Ellison surely hesitating about whether to keep lavishing many more millions on something he has already won, is in the survival business, too.        
“He loves to be a challenger and he loves New Zealand,” said Bruno Troublé, the former America’s Cup helmsman turned Cup organizer. “But maybe if he loses, he will focus on his island now, on his new personal country.”        
That would be the Hawaiian island of Lanai, which Ellison purchased nearly in its entirety last year. But for this week at least, Ellison remains on what Hawaiians call the mainland as his design teams and sailors explore and re-explore every possible tweak that might keep the momentum in their direction.        
Asking for details on their work is usually about as productive as asking an N.F.L. coach what he learned from watching game film. What is clear is that Oracle has managed to narrow the gap in the last week, winning two of the last three races and getting a true point on the board after starting the Cup with a two-race penalty imposed by an international jury. The jury found that the team had broken rules in preliminary regattas in smaller boats.        
Oracle’s leaders remain privately furious about that judgment, which also deprived them of their lead wing-sail trimmer, Dirk de Ridder, who was suspended. A post-regatta legal challenge from Oracle cannot be ruled out if it loses, particularly if the final score is close. Meanwhile, Oracle has narrowed the gap on the water — in large part — by improving its upwind speed significantly.        
“There are probably four or five changes to the boat, all visible to the naked eye, so I’ll challenge you to find them,” said Dirk Kramers, a design executive for Oracle.        
Team New Zealand apparently has not found them all yet.        
“I’m at least three or four behind,” joked (perhaps) Nick Holroyd, the technical director for Team New Zealand, who sat next to Kramers at a news conference Tuesday.        
What came through in that exchange was the techie thrill they and so many others have felt at being part of the newest and fastest generation of Cup yachts.        
“I’m like a kid in a candy store here,” Kramers said.        
The rules governing the candy store shifted significantly in May after Andrew Simpson, a sailor with the challenger Artemis Racing, died when the team’s AC72 capsized during training in San Francisco Bay.        
This Cup, which has brought the venerable event into the extreme-sport era, was also supposed to allow the teams to compete in a wide range of wind conditions and avoid the cancellations that have hurt its appeal and marketability.        
The original wind limit for the Cup match was 33 knots. But after Simpson’s death and extensive negotiations, Cup officials lowered the upper range to 23 knots, and the ebb tide lowered it further Tuesday.        
“As frustrating as it may seem, I think the safety rules are in place for all the right reasons,” said Ken Read, a former Cup helmsman who is now a television analyst.        
Team New Zealand was once the team pushing for higher wind limits, but with Oracle appearing to thrive in the upper ranges in the last few days, the New Zealanders are now all for extra caution.        
Oracle officials made a request on Monday’s day off to raise the wind limits by one knot. They also proposed that races no longer be stopped once they have begun if the winds increase, which happened on Saturday.        
“I think now the crews are so expert and the boats are hopefully very fit,” said Tom Ehman, the vice commodore of the Golden Gate Yacht Club and a key member of Oracle’s brain trust. “So you can do some things that maybe three or four months ago did not seem reasonable.”        
Reasonable or not, Oracle’s proposal, which required mutual consent, was rejected by Team New Zealand, which should come as no surprise at this all-or-nothing phase of another America’s Cup when mutual consent is every bit as elusive as job security.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Gerald L. Read’s neighbors here often spotted him walking the rescue dogs that he and his wife took in and treated like children. He loved those dogs, along with his perfectly tended garden and his three granddaughters, who had come for a backyard cookout on Labor Day.        


But on Tuesday, Mr. Read’s neighbor Carole Willis shook with sobs as she remembered him as a quiet, kind man who helped her with household tasks and fed the neighborhood squirrels. Mr. Read, 58, died along with 11 others on Monday in the shootings at the Washington Navy Yard, killed just as they were beginning their workweek inside what had seemed a carefully guarded complex not far from the Capitol.        
“He was just the most dependable, nonquestioning person,” she said of Mr. Read, an information assurance specialist with the Navy Sea Systems Command. “Just, ‘No problem.’ ”        
The nine men and three women who died in the shootings were civilians and contractors; at least some of them were eating breakfast in the cafeteria of Building 197 when the gunman, Aaron Alexis, perched above an atrium and fired down on them. Friends and relatives remembered them on Tuesday as loyal parents and children, hard workers, sports and nature lovers — people who found pleasure in simple things.        
Kenneth Proctor, 46, would fix a car for anyone, just for the fun of it. He adored his bright yellow Mustang, and his sons, Kenneth Jr., 17, and Kendull, 15. He remained “best friends” with Evelyn Charlene Newman after their divorce in January, Ms. Newman said.        
Mr. Proctor, who worked as a civilian utilities foreman at the navy yard, met Ms. Newman 25 years ago, when they were both young and flirtatious. Ms. Newman was won over by “his charm and persistence,” she said. They married in 1994.        
“His kids, they were everything to him. He was a very loving, caring father,” Ms. Newman said. In his spare time, Mr. Proctor visited racetracks and hung out with his many friends and his sons at places like Buffalo Wild Wings and T.G.I. Fridays. But what stood out for his ex-wife was his compassion.        
“He was always being there for me,” she said, “even after the divorce.”        
Kathleen Gaarde of Woodbridge, Va., was a “caring daughter, fantastic mother” and a wife of 38 years, her husband, Doug Gaarde, said in a statement.        
She worked as a financial analyst at the navy yard, according to The Associated Press, and the couple had an adult son and daughter.        
“She loved her animals and was a bluebird counter for the local refuge,” Mr. Gaarde said in his statement. “She also loved hockey and the Washington Capitals and was a season-ticket holder for over 25 years.”        
Ms. Gaarde was a frequent presence at the Occoquan Bay National Wildlife Refuge in Woodbridge, said Amanda Daisey, the assistant refuge manager, coming weekly in the spring and summer to monitor nesting bluebirds.        
Frank Kohler, 50, of Tall Timbers, Md., was “a Steeler fan, a golfer, a great family man, a Christian and a great friend,” according to a Facebook post by a friend and former colleague, Bob Allen. He left behind a wife and two daughters who recently graduated from King’s Christian Academy in Callaway, Md., where school officials told students about his death on Tuesday.        
Richard Michael Ridgell of Westminster, Md., was a 17-year veteran of the Maryland State Police, working there until 2000 and leaving as a corporal, said Sgt. Marc Black, a spokesman for the state police.        
Mr. Ridgell, 52, was working as a security guard at the navy yard, his family told a local television station in Baltimore in an interview. He had three daughters, who told a local television station that he would want to be remembered as a great father, not as a victim.         
Martin Bodrog, 54, of Annandale, Va., taught preschool on Sundays at Immanuel Bible Church, according to a statement from his family. A graduate of the United States Naval Academy, he was a surface warfare officer in the Navy, with expertise in amphibious operations. But later in life, Christian outreach to local high school students and hockey games featuring his beloved Boston Bruins were among his passions. It was common to see him out with his dog, in his “trademark Boston Bruins jersey” and shorts — even in the worst winter weather. Also common was the sight of Mr. Bodrog “helping shovel all the driveways of his elderly neighbors,” according to the statement.        
After he retired, Mr. Bodrog worked for the Navy as a senior analyst, overseeing the design and procurement of ships. He is survived by his wife of 25 years, Melanie, and three daughters.        
Arthur Daniels, 51, was a father of five and grandfather of nine. He was installing furniture at the navy yard on Monday as an employee of District Furniture Repair in Arlington County, Va.

In early May, Gov. Chris Christie arrived at the Liberty National Golf Course in New Jersey for a political fund-raiser. Donors, many of them longtime backers of his, enjoyed hors d’oeuvres and views of the Lower Manhattan skyline while he spoke of the important work to be done on issues like jobs and the economy.        


Not a single check was written to Mr. Christie’s campaign. Indeed, some of those in attendance were legally prohibited from doing so, because they had sizable contracts with state agencies and were therefore barred by New Jersey law from making large contributions to the governor.        
Instead, the donors wrote checks for as much as $100,000 to the Republican Governors Association, an organization Mr. Christie helps lead that has collected $1.65 million from New Jersey donors during the first six months of the year.        
The association has, in turn, poured $1.7 million into Mr. Christie’s re-election effort, with television advertisements attacking State Senator Barbara Buono, his Democratic opponent in the election this year.        
Mr. Christie’s close relationship with the association provides a playbook for how carefully choreographed independent spending campaigns can undermine the rules meant to curtail the political influence of government contractors; New Jersey’s pay-to-play law strictly limits the participation of state contractors in political giving.        
According to an analysis by The New York Times, a third of the $1.65 million the association raised in New Jersey came from people and businesses who had significant contracts with the state, or from utilities, which are prohibited from making any contributions to candidates for governor.        
That money has helped set the stage for what Christie allies hope will be an overwhelming re-election victory this November in a Democratic-leaning state, boosting his prospects going into the 2016 presidential race.        
“I don’t view it as a workaround,” said Wayne J. Positan, a lawyer who attended the May fund-raiser and whose firm has earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in new state work since Mr. Christie took office.        
“I view it as making a contribution to the R.G.A.,” he added, “and they provide a really good forum for governors to work together.”        
Mr. Christie is to become chairman of the association next year, a high-profile position that will further strengthen his relationships with national Republican donors and give him a prominent platform in national politics as he considers a presidential candidacy.        
“Governor Christie has been very active in the R.G.A.,” said Gail Gitcho, a spokeswoman for the association. “He is helping raise money for the mammoth cycle we have next year, with 36 statewide races across the country.”        
Mr. Christie is not the only one benefiting from outside spending during the campaign. While Ms. Buono, who is subject to the same pay-to-play restrictions as Mr. Christie, has struggled to raise campaign cash, she has been lavishly backed by outside groups and unions.        
One group, a nonprofit organization called One New Jersey, has already spent $2.8 million on television and radio ads attacking Mr. Christie for opposing tax increases on the wealthy and for vetoing an increase in the minimum wage.        
Unlike the Republican Governors Association, One New Jersey is not required to disclose any of its donors. A person with knowledge of the group’s fund-raising said a major source of its money was the New Jersey Education Association, the state teachers’ union, which previously spent more than $13 million on issue ads attacking Mr. Christie during battles over the state education budget and his property tax cap proposal. New Jersey’s pay-to-play restrictions do not cover unions.        
While estimates on total advertising spending in the race vary, Mr. Christie’s campaign has spent far more on ads than Ms. Buono, who has relied heavily on unions and outside groups to close the gap. Mr. Christie remains heavily favored to win the race.        
Both sides in the race for governor described a kind of campaign finance arms race, especially in the area of independent expenditures, which faced few restrictions in New Jersey even before the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court forced many states to rewrite their election laws.

DETROIT — Volkswagen, the largest of the European automakers, will bring its first electric car to the United States in two years, joining an increasingly crowded field of battery-powered vehicles on the market.        


A Volkswagen official said on Tuesday that the e-Golf — an electrified version of the company’s subcompact car — would go on sale in 2015 as part of a broader plan to introduce more alternative-fuel models.        
It is an important step for a company that is trying to expand rapidly in the United States, but has not kept pace with the market recently.        
Marc Trahan, an executive vice president for Volkswagen’s American unit, said VW could follow the e-Golf with more electrified models if demand increased.        
“We want to be the leader in the global context, but other manufacturers have gotten a little ahead of the curve,” Mr. Trahan said after a speech to the Automotive Press Association here.        
The company’s entry into the electric market is another sign that automakers are pushing ahead with expensive new battery-powered models despite a tepid response from consumers.        
General Motors, which has been moderately successful with its Volt plug-in hybrid sedan, which runs primarily on battery power but is backed up by a gasoline engine, is working on a purely electric model with an extended battery range.        
Terry Rhadigan, a spokesman for G.M., said the company was experimenting with battery technology in the hope of one day offering an electric car with a 200-mile range on a single charge.        
“That’s the race for the holy grail,” Mr. Rhadigan said. “The 200-mile battery will be an important milestone, and we are working on it.”        
G.M., the biggest American automaker, has set no timetable for the vehicle. The company will be bolstering its alternative-fuel lineup next year when it adds a Cadillac version of the Volt.        
BMW, the German luxury car company, will begin selling an electric car in Germany later this year. The company is also planning a high-end, hybrid gas-electric sports car for the United States by 2014.        
Volkswagen has relied on diesel technology as a fuel-saving alternative to conventional gasoline engines.        
More than 70 percent of the diesel-powered vehicles sold this year in the United States have been Volkswagens.        
But Volkswagen’s chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, said at last week’s Frankfurt auto show that the company was now accelerating its development of hybrids, plug-ins and electric models.        
Mr. Trahan said that new flexible vehicle platforms for future mainstream models could be adapted for alternative-fuel variations.        
“We don’t have to have totally different platforms for hybrid or gas or electric models,” he said. “Whether it’s the Passat or the Beetle, we can react to what the market wants.”        
Volkswagen has doubled its sales in the United States in the last four years, and its Audi luxury brand has enjoyed particularly strong growth among American buyers.        
But the company still has less than a 4 percent share of the United States market. This year, through August, the combined sales of the Volkswagen and Audi brands have increased just 2.5 percent, compared with 9.6 percent for the overall market.        
The automaker is considering adding a small sport utility vehicle to its lineup, but no final decision has been made, Mr. Trahan said.        
He also declined to comment on Tuesday about the drive by the United Automobile Workers to organize hourly employees at the company’s new assembly plant in Tennessee.        
The U.A.W. is trying to make the Volkswagen plant the linchpin of a broader effort to organize nonunion, foreign-owned auto plants in the southern United States. Its latest effort has focused on establishing a German-style works council at the plant that gives employees more involvement in the decision-making process.

Here are law students on a Tuesday morning in 2013, hearing that researchers hope over the next decade or so to map the wiring of the human brain, seeing how individual cells link to bigger circuits. A decade is a sprint, less time than since 9/11, to use one benchmark.        


The scientists want to lift the hood and get a look at the human mind. The students, in a seminar at Fordham University School of Law taught by Prof. Deborah W. Denno, wonder what that will mean for the law.        
Over and over, they put questions to a guest speaker, Joshua R. Sanes, director of the Center for Brain Science at Harvard, about the implications for society if and when brain science can identify with confidence a propensity for violence, or for lying.        
He bats it right back at them.        
“You tell me,” Dr. Sanes said. “It’s a huge issue. I wish I had something smart to say.”        
Last year, President Obama announced that the federal government would create a Brain Initiative to speed up the development of tools that can track how the brain works and how it breaks. It is not hard to imagine the benefits, beginning with more carefully targeted treatments for people afflicted with psychiatric ailments. “There has not been a brand new type of drug for antidepression or autism or schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or O.C.D. in something like 25 years,” Dr. Sanes said. “This is where we have to make a long-term investment and come up with some new types of help because what we are doing isn’t working.”        
Work on animals has shown in broad strokes how information gets into the head and processed, but current imaging tools cannot keep up with the brain’s processing speed, or are not powerful enough to follow the molecular transactions involved in passing information and creating thought.        
Dr. Sanes has made close study of the retina, which he calls “a beautiful part of the brain.” He rates the human eye as a 100-megapixel camera, with 100 million light-receptor cells. The eye also has layers of cells assigned to detecting color contrasts, edges and various motions, especially of objects rising up.        
From all these cells, the brain gets 30 different representations of an image, which it — somehow — assembles into a coherent whole. “You’ve never seen reality the way it is,” he said. “By the time it gets to the brain, it has been decomposed. The brain just throws away 90 percent of the information, because the brain’s job is to keep you alive.”        
That means editing out information that does not pertain to predators or to prey. “At some point, we developed a cortex,” Dr. Sanes said. “The cortex is kind of in charge of making us think we’ve actually seen something.”        
Many discoveries have been made during treatment of certain epileptic patients who can only be helped if a doctor severs misfiring parts of the brain. Because the brain has no pain receptors, patients are awake and can describe what they are experiencing as their neurons are stimulated — something a mouse cannot do.        
And it turns out that there is a Jennifer Aniston neuron.        
The neuroscientists “found a neuron that would fire when it saw a picture of Jennifer Aniston,” Dr. Sanes said. “It wouldn’t fire for any of the other people from ‘Friends’ or a table or a car.”        
What evolutionary edge a person gets from such a neuron awaits more study.        
It is now believed that diseased circuits caused diseased brains, which we experience as psychiatric disorders, Dr. Sanes said. A student, Brittany Taylor, asked what such broken structures would mean if they cause somebody to commit a crime. “Are we going to look at that as a mitigating circumstance, or are we going to have to change our culpability standards completely?” she asked. What if other parts of the brain were involved, or if environmental factors were influencing the neurons? Could someone say with confidence that the neurons made him do it?        
“Science has a limit,” Dr. Sanes said. “You’re going to have all this information and you’re not going to know.”        
But he assured them that they needed to be ready. Knowledge from the human genome project of the genetic code, will amplify — or complicate — brain mapping efforts, which are known as the Human Connectome.        
“Fifteen years from now, somebody is going to say it’s the 489th neuron from the back of your ear that made you do it,” along with a mutant gene, Dr. Sanes said. “That’s going to be hard to dismiss.        
“You guys have got a lot of work to do.”

Details buried in the United Nations report on the Syrian chemical weapons attack point directly at elite military formations loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, some of the strongest findings to date that suggest the government gassed its own people.        


The inspectors, instructed to investigate the attack but not to assign blame, nonetheless listed the precise compass directions of flight for two rocket strikes that appeared to lead back toward the government’s elite redoubt in Damascus, Mount Qasioun, which overlooks and protects neighborhoods and Mr. Assad’s presidential palace and where his Republican Guard and the army’s powerful Fourth Division are entrenched.        
“It is the center of gravity of the regime,” said Elias Hanna, a retired general in the Lebanese Army and a lecturer on strategy and geopolitics at the American University of Beirut. “It is the core of the regime.”        
In presenting the data concerning two rocket strikes — the significance of which was not commented upon by the United Nations itself — the report provides a stronger indication than the public statements of intelligence services of the United States, France or Britain that the Syrian military not only carried out the attack, but apparently did so brazenly, firing from the same neighborhoods or ridges from which it has been firing high-explosive conventional munitions for much of the war.        
Looming over a tense capital and outlying neighborhoods bristling with anger and fear, Mount Qasioun is Damascus’s most prominent military position. It is also a complex inseparably linked to the Assad family’s rule, a network of compounds and positions occupied by elite units led by members of the president’s inner circle and clan.        
The units based on the mountain are “as close to the Assad regime as it’s going to get,” said Emile Hokayem, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Mr. Hokayem added that theories that the chemicals had been launched by a rebel mole seeking to discredit the government were unlikely because of the solidity and tight control of those units.        
Mr. Assad’s government and its ally Russia have continued to claim publicly that Syrian rebels were responsible for the attacks, which killed hundreds of people, many of them children, in the most lethal chemical warfare attack in decades. But the United Nations data, if accurate, would undercut that claim and appear to erase some of the remaining ambiguity.        
Rebel forces have never penetrated the major military installations of Mount Qasioun. In tactical and technical terms, they would almost certainly have been unable to organize and fire sustained and complex barrages of rockets from that location undetected.        
The United Nations’ evidence was gathered through standard measurements and investigative techniques at the places where sarin-filled rockets struck on Aug. 21.        
At one impact site, investigators found both the place where the rocket had passed through a “vegetal screen” above a wall just before it hit the ground, and the small impact crater itself.        
They noted that “the line linking the crater and the piercing of the vegetal screen can be conclusively established and has a bearing of 35 degrees.”        
At another impact area in another section of Damascus, a 330-millimeter rocket landed on what investigators described as “earthy, relatively soft ground, where the shaft/engine of the projectile remained dug in, undisturbed until investigated.”        
The rocket’s shaft, the investigators noted, “pointed precisely in a bearing of 285 degrees.”        
There the investigators’ public comments about their observations at impact sites essentially stopped, except for a parting explanation that shows how to reach a conclusion that the United Nations itself, in accordance with its mandate, did not say.        
These azimuths, or compass bearings, they noted, can be reversed to show the direction from which the rockets had been fired. They point back toward the geographic source of the attack, which investigators on the ground presumably would have been able, with their own eyes, to see high above them in the city.

Ever Orozco’s afternoon on Monday began with a short car trip across Queens to take his wife to a doctor’s appointment. For Mr. Orozco, 69, of Woodside, it was a routine task on a crisp and sunny day.        


But minutes after dropping her off, the police said, Mr. Orozco encountered a 22-year-old man who pulled out a knife and stabbed him to death.        
What at first appeared to be a frightening daytime street crime grew stranger on Tuesday. It was not a robbery or a dispute between acquaintances, the police said, but a random and hate-fueled assault prompted by the younger man’s stated belief that Mr. Orozco had made sexual advances.        
The suspect, Steven Torres, told detectives after his arrest on Monday that Mr. Orozco had been “blowing kisses” at him and made a sexual gesture as the two crossed paths at 90th Street and Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights.        
It was not the first time that Mr. Torres had reacted violently to what he said were the advances of an older man in recent days, the police said: last week he stabbed a 47-year-old co-worker for what he told detectives were similar actions.        
The police have expressed skepticism that either victim did what Mr. Torres described as having provoked him to stab them. Angela DeRoberts, who lived down the hall from the Orozcos, said she could not imagine Mr. Orozco gesturing at a stranger on the street. “Thinking of him, I’d find that behavior very surprising,” she said.        
The first attack, last Thursday, took place at a job site in Lower Manhattan where Mr. Torres, who lives in the Bronx, and the other man, identified as Miguel Gonzalez, were working as contractors, the police said.        
A witness told the police that he overheard a dispute between the men in which Mr. Torres could be heard saying, “Stop blowing kisses at me.” Shortly after, he brandished a knife, the police said, and stabbed Mr. Gonzalez in the left arm.        
That stabbing was not initially reported to the police; detectives learned about it from Mr. Torres during questioning after Monday’s deadly attack.        
The police charged Mr. Torres with second-degree murder as a hate crime and with weapons possession. His arraignment was delayed for an evaluation at Elmhurst Hospital, according to the Queens district attorney’s office; by Tuesday afternoon he had been discharged. A law enforcement official said he had undergone a psychiatric evaluation, but declined to give the results.        
Police officials said that Mr. Torres had not been formally charged with the earlier stabbing assault, though such charges were likely. Investigators would also be looking at it as a possible hate crime.        
It was not clear what about Mr. Orozco attracted Mr. Torres’s attention after the older man dropped off his wife, Alba, at her doctor’s office around 12:45 p.m. The police said he parked his car, went to pay for the spot at a nearby Muni-Meter and returned to place the receipt on his dashboard.        
Under the rumbling elevated No. 7 train, he exited the vehicle a second time, the police said, and encountered Mr. Torres, who stabbed him almost immediately before running north. Plainclothes officers arrested Mr. Torres several blocks away.        
“We loved him; he was such a friendly man,” said Lorraine Bender, who works at Boulevard Gardens, the Woodside co-op complex where Mr. Orozco had lived with his wife since 2003. “He and my granddaughter had the same birthday and every year he would say, ‘Give your little granddaughter a kiss for me.’ ”

WASHINGTON — For four years, President Obama counted on fellow Democrats to rally to his side in a series of epic battles with Republicans over the direction of the country. But now, deep in his fifth year in office, Mr. Obama finds himself frustrated by members of his own party weary of his leadership and increasingly willing to defy him.        


In recent weeks, disgruntled Democrats, particularly liberals, have bolted from the White House on issues like National Security Agency surveillance policies, a planned military strike on Syria and the potential choice of Lawrence H. Summers to lead the Federal Reserve. In private, they often sound exasperated describing Mr. Obama’s operation; in public, they are sometimes only a little more restrained.        
They complain the White House has not consulted enough and failed to assert leadership. They say Mr. Obama has been too passive and ceded momentum to Republicans. Their grievances are sometimes contradictory; some grouse that he takes on causes he cannot win, while others say he does not fight hard enough for principled positions. The failure to enact tightened gun control laws and the Republican hold on immigration legislation have left liberals little to celebrate this year.        
“If you read the papers, you almost think the Republicans are in control,” said Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and vigorously opposed Mr. Summers until he withdrew from consideration. “They’re constantly on the offensive. Democrats are on the defensive.”        
The lack of strong leadership, he added, has created a vacuum. “I think you’re going to see more independents saying, ‘Mr. President, we look forward to working with you, but we’re not simply going to accept your leadership and your ideas,’ ” he said. “ ‘We’re not going to follow you. You’re going to have to work with us.’ ”        
Mr. Obama’s trouble with Democrats is not unusual for a second term and could be temporary or episodic. With re-election behind him, members of his party see no need to stick with him to secure another four years. They are also looking ahead to the next election earlier than usual with the emergence of Hillary Rodham Clinton as a front-runner.        
By the end of his fifth year, President Bill Clinton had alienated liberals with the North American Free Trade Agreement, a welfare overhaul and a balanced budget deal with Republicans. President George W. Bush in his fifth and sixth years was in worse shape with Republicans, who shelved his Social Security overhaul, rebelled against the deteriorating Iraq war and helped sink his Supreme Court nomination of Harriet E. Miers.        
“It makes it a lot harder when it’s your own party,” said Peter H. Wehner, a top Bush aide at the time. “You can’t fire back with the same intensity and vehemence as when it’s the other party. And it just changes the dynamics — people expect you to be criticized by the other party. When your own party does it, it’s an indication of weakness.”        
The internecine tension presents a challenge to Mr. Obama as he heads into renewed budget wars with Congress. “It makes a political life for him that’s already hard even harder,” said Jared Bernstein, a former Obama White House economist. “The gridlock he faces from Republicans, especially in the House, is extremely obstructionist to his agenda, so when he runs into Democrats who are blocking him, it becomes insurmountable.”        
The White House discounted suggestions of trouble with Congressional Democrats and produced voting statistics showing that, with the exception of Mr. Bush, Mr. Obama had more support from his own party in his first four years than any president through Dwight D. Eisenhower. Democrats stood behind him on health care, Wall Street regulation and budget battles.        
“President Obama has received unprecedented support from his party in Congress,” said Dan Pfeiffer, his senior adviser. “Of course we won’t agree on everything all the time — every family has its squabbles — but the periodic disagreements in the Democratic Party pale in comparison to the epic existential civil war for the soul of the Republican Party that is leading to so much dysfunction.”        
The White House’s statistics show that Senate Democrats voted with Mr. Obama more than 90 percent of the time over his first four years, compared with Mr. Clinton, who had support in the 80 percent range over a similar period and President Ronald Reagan, whose party voted with him in the 70 percent range.

Relatives of Amir Hekmati, a former Marine imprisoned in Iran for more than two years on spying charges, asked the United States ambassador to the United Nations on Tuesday to press for his release when Iran’s presidential delegation visits the General Assembly next week.        


Representative Daniel T. Kildee, the Michigan Democrat who represents the family’s district, sent a letter to Ambassador Samantha Power asking that she “explore all available opportunities” with colleagues from countries that have diplomatic relations with Iran to seek Mr. Hekmati’s return on humanitarian grounds. The United States and Iran severed diplomatic ties more than three decades ago after the Islamic Revolution.        
The General Assembly meeting, which will be attended by Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, represented what Mr. Kildee called “a particularly auspicious opportunity.”        
Mr. Hekmati, 30, an American of Iranian descent from Flint, Mich., was arrested in Iran in August 2011, during what his family has said was an innocuous visit to his grandmother. He was charged with espionage and sentenced to death.        
His sentence was overturned and a new trial was ordered but has not been scheduled, and the exact nature of the accusations against him has never been explained.        
He has spent most of his incarceration in Evin Prison in Tehran, including months of solitary confinement, and his case has become another irritant in Iran’s estranged relationship with the United States.        
In a letter smuggled from prison to Secretary of State John Kerry, reported by his family last week, Mr. Hekmati said he had been falsely accused and denied his legal rights.        
His family has held out hope that Mr. Rouhani would free Mr. Hekmati as a gesture of his sincerity in seeking better relations with the United States.        
The family has also directly appealed to the Iranian authorities for compassion because Mr. Hekmati’s father, a college professor, has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Mr. Kildee raised the father’s illness in his letter to Ms. Power, saying “It is imperative that Mr. Hekmati be reunited with his family” for that reason.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Dexter Douglass, one of the lead lawyers for Vice President Al Gore during the chaotic presidential election recount of 2000, died on Tuesday at his home here. He was 83.        


His daughter Lacy Douglass said her father had been treated for bladder cancer.        
Mr. Douglass, who had a long career in Democratic politics and state government in Florida, was part of Mr. Gore’s legal team, which pressed for ballot recounts after the close election results in Florida.        
His demeanor in court led The New York Times to call him a “stem-winding old-school Tallahassee orator who in another era would have worn a white suit and a pocket watch to court.”        
The election turmoil ended after 36 days when the United States Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, halted the recount of ballots that had been ordered by the Florida Supreme Court, ensuring an Electoral College victory for the Republican candidate, George W. Bush.        
Mr. Douglass had been general counsel to Gov. Lawton Chiles in the 1990s. The two men had met each other while attending the University of Florida and were longtime friends.        
Mr. Douglass left the counsel’s job in order to guide a constitutional revision panel that made several sweeping changes to state government in 1998. Voters approved amendments that year that shrank the size of the state cabinet and made the governor more powerful.        
William Dexter Douglas was born on Dec. 6, 1929, in Holmes County, Fla., in the Panhandle. He owned a 300-acre cattle farm north of Tallahassee. He is survived by his wife, Therese, as well as three daughters and several grandchildren, The Miami Herald reported. A son died before him.

Summary,"










INTERNATIONAL  
An article on Tuesday about a pledge by Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, that his country would support whomever Syrians want as their leader even if it is not the current Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, misspelled, in one instance and in some editions, the surname of the head of the Iranian government agency in charge of that country’s nuclear program, who said Iran is eager to resolve its nuclear standoff with the United States. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Ali Akbar Salehi, not Salahi.

An article on Tuesday about the diplomatic and personal styles of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, who along with United States Secretary of State John Kerry worked out the latest plan to dismantle Syria’s chemical weapons, misidentified, in some editions, the site at a Geneva hotel where the plan was completed. It was by the pool, not at a cafe table.        
NEW YORK 
Because of an editing error, a picture on Monday with an article about the disasters the Kohr family of New Jersey has endured through the years with its frozen custard business, including losses in the recent fire in Seaside Heights, N.J., carried an erroneous credit. The photograph, of a burning Kohr’s Frozen Custard stand, was taken by Justin Auciello/Jersey Shore Hurricane News — not by Robert Stolarik for The New York Times. (A picture of a Kohr’s Original stand, which was not damaged, was taken by Mr. Stolarik.)

A chart on Saturday with the Common Sense column, about rating colleges and universities on the basis of their graduates’ salaries, omitted two institutions from U.S. News & World Report’s 2013 list of the top 10 national universities and liberal arts colleges. Haverford College was tied with Claremont McKenna and Davidson for No. 9 on the U.S. News list for liberal arts colleges, and Dartmouth College was tied with the California Institute of Technology for No. 10 on the university list.

The “Popular Demand” listing in the Most Wanted chart on Monday misstated the length of Robert De Niro’s film career. He got his start in movie acting 48 years ago, not 39. (His first major role was in “Greetings” in 1968, though he also appeared in “Encounter,” an obscure American film, and in an uncredited role in “Three Rooms in Manhattan,” a French film, both in 1965.)        
THE ARTS 
An article on Saturday about a dispute between federal prosecutors and Sotheby’s over an ancient Cambodian statue misstated the name of the law firm in which Peter G. Neiman, who is representing Sotheby’s in the case, is a partner. It is WilmerHale, not Wilmer & Hale.        
SCIENCE TIMES 
A report in the “In Brief” column on Tuesday about researchers’ studying critical care and whether patients received care that their doctors considered futile misstated the number of patients involved in a study. There were 1,136 patients, not 1,316.        
OBITUARIES 
An obituary on Monday about the journalist Lansing Lamont misstated his age and the year of his birth. He was 83, not 82, and he was born on March 13, 1930 — not 1931. The error was repeated in the headline.

                            When Sonya Kelly was a little girl in Dublin, she needed glasses.        


                            She really, really needed them. As Ms. Kelly recalls in “I Can See Clearly Now (The Wheelchair on My Face),” her funny and fetching solo show, “I usen’t to be able to see so well.” Given a perfunctory eye test at school, she couldn’t see the giant letter on the top line. Heck, she couldn’t see the eye chart. She had always thought that everyone perceived the world as a big blur of color. “Trees were like giant balls of green wool,” she says. “Birds were only sounds.”        

                            After a playful comic entrance, which involves things falling on the floor, Ms. Kelly, dressed in a friendly plaid shirt, sloppy cardigan and black jeans, gets down to explaining her childhood. She is considered a particularly affectionate girl because she has to be extremely physically close to people to see what they look like. Her doll Spock “didn’t fit in with the other dolls.” (Spock, a girl, was always flying off to outer space while others, “Arabella, Cinderella, Santaponza,” were having tea parties.) Sonya develops a rich fantasy life in which the Swedish pop group Abba lives in her wardrobe and frets that she can’t join them on tour. She explains patiently to her famous friends, “In Ireland, if you don’t go to school, they send your parents to prison.”        

                            Putting on her first pair of eyeglasses is a revelation, even though the lenses are so thick and heavy they seem like fishbowls. And realizing that Audrey McKenzie, the unkind girl who sits next to Sonya at school, is “a minger” (quite unattractive) is absolutely empowering.        

                            This production — from Fishamble: The New Play Company, seamlessly directed by Gina Moxley — is about an hour long. That is exactly enough time to fall in love with Ms. Kelly so that you sincerely wish her well with her staphyloma and pathological myopia. (She has been helped by surgery.) In the end her story is a paean to the thrill of sexy sunglasses — the kind she remembers Abba wearing.

It is a time-honored rite of the political life. But tradition does not make it any less painful.        


In a ceremony that strove to convey unity, and set aside recent rancor, Christine C. Quinn on Tuesday bestowed her blessing on the rival she fought most bitterly in the Democratic mayoral primary, Bill de Blasio.        
After a campaign of jousts and fierce attacks, of dreams both realized and dashed, the erstwhile opponents wore only smiles. There were hugs, banter, and a gentle joke or two, as the high priests of local Democratic politics — labor leaders and activists, members of Congress and the City Council — presided on the steps of City Hall.        
“She has so much to be proud of,” said Mr. de Blasio, the Democratic nominee, beaming at his onetime foil. Ms. Quinn, her mayoral hopes derailed, urged her supporters to work for Mr. de Blasio’s campaign “just as hard as they did for me.”        
Unmentioned was the brutal fight between the two in 2005, when each pursued the Council’s speakership, and the bruised feelings that festered after Ms. Quinn won. Absent was any hint of the hostility that animated their primary debates, when Ms. Quinn said Mr. de Blasio “will say anything” to get votes, and he accused her of cutting “a back-room deal” to repeal the city’s term limits.        
Asked by reporters to square her previous criticism with Tuesday’s praise, Ms. Quinn, again, smiled. “I trust Bill de Blasio,” she said emphatically, before pledging to do what she could to ensure he is elected mayor in November.        
Ms. Quinn, who spent the weekend after her defeat relaxing in Vermont, betrayed no sign of inner turmoil. She kissed her taller rival on the cheek several times, let loose a few of her trademark chortles, and made clear that the defeat had done little to dent her sense of humor.        
“I just told Bill not to faint,” Ms. Quinn said after the two emerged from City Hall, a sly reference to the teenagers — two of them — who passed out at her events over the summer. “We’re turning a new leaf on that today.”        
Of course, there was no doubt that Ms. Quinn, as the former front-runner, had been disappointed at the outcome. “I offered to have a unifying party, to thank her for running and everything, and she was not up for it,” said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a stalwart Quinn supporter who attended Tuesday’s event.        
Thomas K. Duane, a former state senator and Ms. Quinn’s mentor in matters both political and personal, stood stoically behind his protégé.        
“It’s the day to be a good Democrat,” Mr. Duane said afterward, adding, “I believe that there is a plan for the way things are going to work out, that none of us expect.”        
Was the moment bittersweet? Mr. Duane paused a moment. “Yes, it is,” he replied. Ms. Quinn, he added, “will have challenges, and she’ll meet them. I know that, for sure.”        
As the rally began, a top aide to Ms. Quinn stood apart from the crowd, watching from the top of the City Hall staircase. A sympathetic security guard stopped at his side.        
“It’s just the beginning,” the guard said, encouragingly, to which the aide flashed a mirthless smile. “Beginning of what?” he asked.

Re “Was Salinger Too Pure for This World?” (Sunday Review, Sept. 15):        
Joyce Maynard’s revealing essay about J. D. Salinger’s exploitation of young women, some of them minors, is very brave and credible. It’s so sad that young people treated recklessly by older people in positions of power — artistic, religious, educational or even political — are left damaged and unlikely to take advantage of our legal system while statutes of limitations still apply.        
These perpetrators use their superior powers to threaten their victims with all manner of horrors if they dare to tell. The maturity demonstrated by Ms. Maynard bespeaks the potential for victims to survive and grow. Therapeutic help is more available now than in earlier decades thanks to voices like that of Joyce Maynard.        
LYNN OCHBERG
Okemos, Mich., Sept. 15, 2013        
To the Editor: 
Bravo to Joyce Maynard for finally saying what should have been said years ago. I only wish that J. D. Salinger were alive to read it. His relationship with teenage girls amounted to little more than child abuse.        
I fell for Holden Caulfield when I was 12, as did every girl who read Mr. Salinger’s iconic novel, “The Catcher in the Rye,” and I can understand how young women would have been sucked into his creator’s magnetic, sacrosanct world.        
Where is it written that women aren’t allowed to talk about what happened to them? The world bought into Mr. Salinger’s convenient (for him), self-serving rule — that his privacy was more important than anyone else’s well-being.        
Of course, J. D. Salinger is not alone in his treatment of women. Hemingway, Picasso and scores of others could easily join the ranks. It’s about time women spoke up.

To the Editor: 


We believe that “Selling the Fantasy of Fertility,” by Miriam Zoll and Pamela Tsigdinos (Op-Ed, Sept. 12), paints an incomplete picture of the likely success of infertility treatments.        
Despite the dramatic advances in medicine of the last 30 years, it is true that not every infertility patient will get pregnant, but patients and the public deserve to have all the facts. Among those facts are that assisted reproductive technology treatments have resulted in the birth of more than five million babies around the world, and while it sometimes takes more than one attempt, more than 60 percent of women who undergo treatments eventually end up with a baby.        
We, like the writers, recognize the tremendous emotional distress that can result for patients whose treatments are not successful, and hence the need to have transparency and full disclosure of available data for decision making in infertility therapy and coping with the emotional aspects that accompany it.

Washington, Sept. 12, 2013        
To the Editor: 
In my experience, the “obvious off-ramp” from fertility madness was adoption through my state’s foster care system. My ultimate goal was to be a parent, not necessarily to pass along my genes, procreate, experience pregnancy or any of the myriad reasons people have for pursuing infertility treatment. My two daughters are gorgeous and healthy. “Don’t give up the fight”? To the contrary, it’s the best thing I ever did.        
LAUREN MUFSON
Clifton, N.J., Sept. 12, 2013        
To the Editor: 
Another consequence of the “magical thinking” marketed by the fertility industry is the unrealistic expectation that any woman, no matter how old, can have a baby. As a nearly 41-year-old first-time bride, I was shocked at how many people took it for granted that I could and would have a child. My efforts to educate them on basic human biology fell on deaf ears. Wasn’t it enough, I thought, that I had already beaten one set of odds by marrying in middle age?        
The fantasy that all women can and should have children is perniciously pervasive, as well as highly profitable for the field of reproductive medicine. The cold, hard truth is that the majority of women over 40 won’t conceive. I guess a lot of people just don’t want to believe that.        
JULIE LLOYD
Washington, Sept. 12, 2013        
To the Editor: 
Are the 59,446 babies born in the United States from assisted reproductive technology during the last reporting year a fantasy? Is the fertility “business,” as the Op-Ed writers bitterly call it, offering just hype, or is it really hope? Would they deny cancer sufferers the hope of continuing treatment once the initial treatment did not offer a complete cure?        
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine has done an excellent job in minimizing hype by imposing strict advertising guidelines in reporting success rates. Success rates for each practice are published online at sart.org for all to see. The success rate in a woman’s age group for the specialist she plans to use is far more important than some global failure rate.        
But the quest for a child can be so overwhelming that many do not want that dose of reality. In my experience, usually it is the couple that continues the “fight” long after the fertility specialist has recommended moving on to another method of family building.        
The writers are correct on one point: as in the Kenny Rogers song “The Gambler,” “You got to know when to hold ’em, know when to fold ’em.”

The writer, a fertility specialist with Reproductive Partners, is the co-author of “Conceptions & Misconceptions.”  
To the Editor: 
As I read “Selling the Fantasy of Fertility,” I felt a profound relief that I confronted my own infertility over 30 years ago, before the medical industry’s focus on biological parenting had become so advanced and seductive.        
My adopted son looks nothing like me, but my son he is. To parent, with or without replicating one’s own genes or experiencing birth, is the core experience to embrace or decline.

Re “Piercing the Mystery of Potter’s Field” (The City Life, editorial page, Sept. 11):        
While I am grateful to be credited with helping to get New York City to open its books and provide personal identity information for recent burials on Hart Island, there needs to be greater effort to provide access to graves and digital location information. Quite simply, the mother of a stillborn child needs to know where her baby is buried.         
Recently, the Department of Correction removed the numbered concrete markers from the mass graves on Hart Island. It now refuses to provide GPS (longitude and latitude) information that would allow people to find a grave using free online digital mapping tools. The department cites public safety concerns as a reason to deny even virtual access to grave locations.         
Last month, lawyers for the Hart Island Project, a public charity hosting a database of over 60,000 adult and infant burials between 1980 and 2013, filed an appeal to the department’s denial of a freedom of information request for GPS information.        
One of the problems arising from allowing the prison system to serve as city sexton is that the storytelling traditionally associated with visiting graves becomes blocked. In addition to digital access to grave sites, we encourage the public to submit stories and photos. They will soon be posted in an interactive feature called the Traveling Cloud Museum that I hope will mitigate the distress of those denied access to the graves while the City Council further considers a bill introduced to transfer jurisdiction of the island to the Department of Parks and Recreation.

Editorial,"










WASHINGTON — On the most deadly day here since Sept. 11, 2001, with the capital reeling over the sadly familiar scene of a mass shooting by a madman, the chief executive stepped to the microphones and captured the heartbreak.        


It wasn’t the chief executive of the nation. It was Dr. Janis Orlowski, the chief operating officer of MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where three of those injured were being treated.        
“There’s something evil in our society that we as Americans have to work to try and eradicate,” she said, her voice stoic but laced with emotion. On the day when she announced only hours earlier that she had submitted her resignation to take another job, she continued: “There’s something wrong here when we have these multiple shootings, these multiple injuries. There is something wrong, and the only thing that I can say is we have to work together to get rid of it. I would like you to put my trauma center out of business. I really would. I would like to not be an expert on gunshots.”        
Calling it “a challenge to all of us,” she concluded: “This is not America.”        
President Obama also gave a speech Monday, talking at the White House while the drama unfolded at the supposedly secure Navy Yard nearby. He could have posted his original remarks on the White House Web site and replaced them with a cri de coeur on gun control, or comfort for the shaken city. The 12 who died were, after all, under his aegis as workers in a federal building.        
But, jarringly, the president went ahead with his political attack, briefly addressing the slaughter before moving on to jab Republicans over the corporate tax rate and resistance to Obamacare.        
Just as with the address to the nation on Syria last week, the president went ahead with a speech overtaken by events. It was out of joint, given that the Senate was put into lockdown and the Washington Nationals delayed a night game against the Atlanta Braves, noting on its Web site, “Postponed: Tragedy.”        
The man who connected so electrically and facilely in 2008, causing Americans to overlook his thin résumé, cannot seem to connect anymore.        
With a shrinking circle of trust inside the White House, Obama is having trouble establishing trust outside with once reliable factions: grass-roots Democrats and liberals in Congress.        
As Peter Baker wrote in The Times, the president is finding himself increasingly “frustrated” by the defiance of Democrats who are despairing of his passive, reactive leadership.        
Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana on the banking committee, told Jonathan Martin for Politico in February, after he scraped through to a second term, that the president was not engaged with the Hill, that he had not met with Obama at the White House since 2010, and that he was sorely missing aides like Rahm Emanuel, who tirelessly worked and stroked Democrats in Congress.        
Tester was one of three Democrats who spurned the president on his favorite to run the Federal Reserve, Larry Summers. The White House didn’t call Tester until Friday, when it was too late; Summers was allowed to twist in the wind, like Susan Rice before him.        
Top Democrats who used to consider Obama one cool cat now muse that he’s “one weird cat,” as one big shot put it.        
Obama still has a secret weapon: Congressional Republicans, who might yet shut down the government or cause a cataclysmic default and make the president look good.        
But, for now, puzzlement grows over the contrast between Obama’s campaign leaps and his governing lassitude. Obama biographer Richard Wolffe notes that the 2012 campaign had some of the same problems with leadership and direction, but looked good compared with the mid-20th-century Romney crowd, “who couldn’t get an app to work.”        
“I don’t know who they think they’re talking to or what they think they’re trying to say,” said Wolffe, whose new book is “The Message: The Reselling of President Obama.” “The president is a very muddled and entrenched figure who needs to get out of a defensive crouch and get some fresh ideas.”        
Unlike Bill Clinton, who excels at boiling down complex arguments to simple ones, Obama prefers to wallow in the weeds, reminding people that he’s the smartest man in the room and expecting their support because he feels he is only doing what’s complicated and right.        
But, funnily enough, as Wolffe points out, “he’s more like the Clintons than I ever thought this White House would be — with different factions and power bases and personal rivalries.”        
ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos asked the president about criticism of the administration’s serpentine Syria policy, citing a frustrated backer of the plan to strike Syria, Senator Bob Corker, a Republican of Tennessee. Corker said that the careering around left Obama diminished as president, and he observed that the president seemed caged in the role, like he wanted to “slip the noose.”        
“I think that folks here in Washington like to grade on style,” Obama said dismissively of his Syria critics.        
But why is it so often the president’s style to be unable to sell the substance — even on issues where most people agree with him?

MIAMI — As many states prepare to introduce a linchpin of the 2010 health care law — the insurance exchanges designed to make health care more affordable — a handful of others are taking the opposite tack: They are complicating enrollment efforts and limiting information about the new program.        


Chief among them is Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott and the Republican-dominated Legislature have made it more difficult for Floridians to obtain the cheapest insurance rates under the exchange and to get help from specially trained outreach counselors.        
Missouri and Ohio, two other states troubled by the Affordable Care Act, have also moved to undercut the law and its insurance exchanges, set to open on Oct. 1. In Georgia, the state insurance commissioner, Ralph T. Hudgens, has said he will do “everything in our power to be an obstructionist.”        
Alarmed by the resistance, the secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, and the Obama administration are intensifying their efforts to win public support for the exchanges in Florida and elsewhere and are confronting their critics head on.        
On Tuesday, Ms. Sebelius capped a three-city visit to Florida — home to the country’s second largest uninsured population — with sharp words about the state’s unwillingness to embrace the law. She will do the same in Missouri later this week.        
“It’s unfortunate that keeping information from people seems to be something of a pattern here in the state,” Ms. Sebelius said at a news conference in Miami, referring to restrictions on outreach counselors.        
The online exchanges are designed to offer a variety of insurance plans at subsidized prices and are meant to make health care more affordable to lower-income people who do not have insurance. Outreach counselors, known as navigators, provide information about the plans and help enroll applicants.        
Ms. Sebelius also criticized Florida’s rejection of $50 billion in federal money over 10 years to expand Medicaid, its concerns about privacy issues, which she said were unfounded, and its sudden unwillingness to grapple with insurance rates.        
Even among states hostile to the law, Florida became an outlier this year when it passed a bill removing for two years the state insurance commissioner’s ability to approve insurance rates for new health plans, she said. This leaves Floridians vulnerable to higher rates at a time when the new health plans will be introduced.        
In other states, insurance commissioners used the law to obtain better deals for consumers.        
“To have the Florida Legislature pass a bill that for two years — 2014 and 2015 — removes rate-review authority really puts Florida consumers at great risk,” Ms. Sebelius said, adding, “No one else has done that.”        
Ms. Sebelius’s criticism is unlikely to inspire cooperation in Florida or in the other states that vigorously oppose the law. Mr. Scott has been one of the law’s fiercest opponents, despite his decision to accept the $50 billion for Medicaid expansion. But the Florida House blocked that effort this year while Mr. Scott sat mostly on the sidelines, failing to lobby for the expansion, lawmakers said. The state also chose not to run its own health care exchange, leaving it to the federal government.        
Democrats said Mr. Scott and Republican lawmakers continued to throw up roadblocks.        
Last week, Florida’s deputy health secretary ordered county health facilities to bar navigators, or outreach counselors. The health department said it was following established policy: All outside groups are prohibited from using county health property to conduct nonstate business. Brochures, though, will be made available, according to a statement. No written requests for space have been made by navigators, a spokesman said.        
County health offices are important in the campaign to reach potential applicants because they deal mostly with lower-income people who may not be insured.        
And on Monday, in a letter to the top Republican and Democrat in Congress, Mr. Scott raised concerns about privacy, saying that navigators and others involved in the health care effort could use applicant information improperly. Attorneys general from 13 states have expressed similar worries about the release of financial and medical information — be it intentional or accidental.        
Saying that Florida was “ground zero” in the Obama administration’s campaign to enroll people, Mr. Scott asked House Speaker John A. Boehner and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, “to thoroughly review what privacy rules and safeguards are in place.”        
“Floridians should not have to exchange their privacy for insurance,” Mr. Scott wrote.        
Ms. Sebelius said on Tuesday that she appreciated the governor’s concerns but that her office, which oversees Medicare, is used to dealing with privacy issues.        
“I can guarantee you we take that very, very seriously, which is why nobody will be collecting personal health information at all at any point along the way,” she said. “Verifying, yes; storing it, no.”        
Florida is not the only state complicating the Obama administration’s efforts to roll out the new exchanges.        
A Missouri law adopted this year requires the licensing of navigators and also restricts their activities. Without that license, the Missouri law says, navigators cannot “provide advice concerning the benefits, terms and features of a particular health plan” or “advise consumers about which health plan to choose.”        
Ohio has adopted a similar law, stating that navigators can distribute some information but cannot recommend a plan or offer advice about benefits in a particular plan.        
In Georgia, the insurance commissioner, Mr. Hudgens, said his “job is to protect consumers.” To that end, Georgia mandates that health insurance counselors be licensed to become navigators, a process that requires criminal background checks and fingerprinting of applicants.        
For Democrats, the new state laws and rules are just another way to throw up obstacles to try to defeat the Affordable Care Act.        
“They couldn’t beat Obamacare in Congress, where they’ve tried 41 times to repeal it, they couldn’t beat it in the Supreme Court, so they are trying death by a thousand cuts,” said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat and chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.

WASHINGTON — Washington’s health care revolving door is spinning fast as the new online health insurance marketplaces, a central provision of President Obama’s health care law, are set to open Oct. 1. Those who had a hand in the law’s passage are now finding lucrative work in the private sector, as businesses try to understand the complex measure, reshape it by pressing for regulatory changes — or profit from it.        


That means boom times for what might be called an Obamacare cottage industry, providing work for dozens of former administration and mostly Democratic Congressional officials whose immersion in health policy minutiae, and friendships, make them invaluable to private business.        
Dr. Dora Hughes, for example, has a medical degree from Vanderbilt and a master’s in public health from Harvard and never envisioned joining a law firm. But Dr. Hughes, a former Obama administration official, has something Washington lawyers and lobbying shops covet: an insider’s understanding of the new health care law.        
After nearly four years as counselor to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, she left government last year to work for Sidley Austin, which represents insurers, pharmaceutical companies, device makers and others affected by the law. She is not a registered lobbyist, but rather a “strategic adviser,” although some call that a distinction without a difference.        
“Health policy is what I do,” Dr. Hughes said in a recent interview. “It’s what I’ve always done, so I’m not doing anything differently. My work is not based only on relationships or trying to curry favor.”        
The health care industry now spends more money on lobbying in Washington than any sector of the economy — more than $243 million last year alone, slightly higher than the $242 million spent by financial, insurance and real estate companies, according to the Center for Responsive Politics here.        
Of the “revolving door lobbyists” profiled by the center, those specializing in health care account for 12 percent, more than any other economic sector.        
Critics say these former officials are cashing in, trading on the relationships and expertise they acquired while working for the taxpayers, and cite such career moves as proof that Mr. Obama has not lived up to his promise to change the culture of influence peddling in the capital.        
Liz Fowler, a onetime executive with WellPoint, the insurer, helped draft the legislation as the chief health counsel for the Senate Finance Committee and later joined the administration. Now she runs global health policy for Johnson & Johnson, the medical equipment and pharmaceutical giant, which strongly backed the health bill and stands to benefit from it.        
Ms. Fowler is not a registered lobbyist, but she does provide in-house advice on the bill — work that has drawn criticism from publications like the British newspaper The Guardian and the Web sites Salon and The Huffington Post, where the journalist Bill Moyers singled out Ms. Fowler, asserting that “when push comes to shove, corporate interests will have the upper hand.”        
Yet the progression from government to the private sector is also predictable, a window into the peculiar rhythms of life in the capital. Young aides, often fresh out of college or graduate school, acquire highly specialized knowledge but eventually settle down, build lives and long for jobs that pay more and let them see their children at night.        
Those were considerations for Dr. Hughes, who has a 3-year-old, and Yvette Fontenot, a mother of three who began her Washington career in 1997, analyzing Medicare for the Office of Management and Budget. Ms. Fontenot worked on the health bill as a Finance Committee aide and later moved to the White House. Four months ago she joined Avenue Solutions, a boutique lobbying shop.        
“Every client out there is interested in the Affordable Care Act and what it means,” said Ms. Fontenot, who like Dr. Hughes concentrates on strategic advice. With exchanges soon to go live, she said, companies “want to know whether there is a potential to build on this, to make changes.”        
Many of the former health care officials are lawyers or lobbyists, though not all. Nancy-Ann DeParle, Mr. Obama’s former “health czar” and later his deputy chief of staff, now guides health care investments as a partner in a new private equity firm, Consonance Capital, with colleagues from her pre-White House days. Bob Kocher, a doctor, management consultant and former member of Mr. Obama’s economics team, is a California venture capitalist, helping finance health start-ups.

PHOENIX — The inspectors who set out last year to review the use-of-force policies employed by the roughly 40,000 federal agents guarding the nation’s borders faced a significant obstacle from the get-go: Neither of two separate systems to track complaints of misconduct offered a clear way to link a specific accusation to the use of excessive force.        


The systems — one operated by the Office of the Inspector General and the other run jointly by Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, all of them arms of the Department of Homeland Security — used different designations to categorize the complaints, making it impossible for the inspectors to determine the total number of excessive-force accusations and investigations against agents, according to a redacted version of their report, released Tuesday.        
Although the discrepancy in the systems has been known at least since the inspectors finished their work in April, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement had yet to add use of force as an option to categorize complaints, the report said.        
To civil rights groups, the shortcoming underlines one of the problems of having a fragmented mechanism to track misconduct that is partly under the authority of the agents’ employer. “At the heart of this report is a question about independence,” said Chris Rickerd, policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that had pressed for the review.        
Since January 2010, agents have killed at least 15 people, including a 16-year-old, along the border with Mexico, sometimes during confrontations set off by rock-throwing and other assaults, other times under less clear circumstances.        
The report did not answer whether the agents were wrong in firing their weapons, frustrating the 16 members of Congress who demanded the review after a PBS documentary last year raised questions about the actions of Customs and Border Protection agents in San Diego in 2010, when a man in their custody died after being stunned several times by a Taser.        
Using the abbreviation by which the agency is known, Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of California, said, “I once again call on C.B.P. to examine the best practices of the nation’s top police forces and take meaningful action to avert future cases of abuse and death at the hands of the federal border enforcement personnel.”        
The report’s scope was limited to the effects the surge in the number of agents in the past six years has had on training and performance and whether reforms adopted by the agency could help avoid deadly encounters. The changes include audits of whether use-of-force policies learned in the academy were understood and correctly applied in the field.        
Over all, the inspectors reviewed 21,000 records from 2007 to 2012, which yielded more than 2,000 allegations of abuse, excessive force or intentional discharge of a weapon. About 500 complaints could not be categorized because the records lacked enough information.        
The findings were mixed. Between 2006 and 2009, when the Border Patrol grew by almost 65 percent, financing for use-of-force training quadrupled. Despite this and other budgetary increases, Customs and Border Protection has yet to build a mock border fence in one of its training centers to simulate the kinds of situations the agents are likely to face, the report found.        
Several officials interviewed by the inspectors said that although border agents know the necessary tools and tactics of the job when they leave basic training, they are not fully prepared for some real-life situations, like the stress and fear they may face when rocks rain on them from the Mexican side of the fence.        
During an internal review, Customs and Border Protection’s use-of-force division found that new border agents and customs officers were not trained on all of the less-lethal weapons available to them, like pepper spray and Tasers, or sufficiently trained on high-risk situations like rock assaults.        
In one instance, an internal audit found that new agents simply did not understand the use-of-force policies when they entered the field. Customs and Border Protection officials said it was a single episode out of 32 audits performed.        
In their response, enclosed in the report, the officials acknowledged the importance of having a mock border-fence area. They noted that while the agency had the building materials, it did not yet have money for construction, though they were working to incorporate at least one simulator in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.        
“We should continue to expand the use of scenario-based training and continue to pursue new technologies to ensure field agents have the right skills,” the response read.

IS Alex Bogusky becoming the Johnny Appleseed of advertising?         
Mr. Bogusky is known in the industry for the risk-taking, rule-breaking creative ideas he came up with in the more than two decades he spent at Crispin Porter & Bogusky and its parent, MDC Partners. Since 2010, when he left MDC, he has started projects like Common and FearLess Revolution. He also joined Made Movement, a fledgling agency in Boulder, Colo., as a minority investor and creative adviser.        
Now, Mr. Bogusky is helping an agency in Chattanooga, Tenn., open its doors by becoming a minority investor and creative adviser there, too. The new agency — in keeping with Mr. Bogusky’s seeming penchant for affiliating with nontraditionally named ventures — is known as Humanaut, a word coined from human and astronaut (or cosmonaut, if you are a Russian Op-Ed columnist).        
“I’m the world’s smallest holding company,” Mr. Bogusky said, laughing.        
When the Appleseed comparison was suggested, he said he liked it. “Just seeds in his pocket and holes in his pocket,” Mr. Bogusky said. “I’m just a guy with money falling out of my pocket.”        
Mr. Bogusky knows one of the two founders of Humanaut, David Littlejohn, because they worked together in the Boulder office of Crispin Porter & Bogusky. The other Humanaut founder, Andrew Clark, is a longtime friend of Mr. Littlejohn’s; before starting Humanaut, they had collaborated for two years as consultants for start-ups — advising them in areas like brand identity and user experience — under the banner of a company with another unusual name, Pale Dot Voyage.        
“David really, really inspired me during his time at C.P.B.,” Mr. Bogusky said, citing as an example an effort for Best Buy called Twelpforce, in which employees in Best Buy stores used Twitter to answer customers’ questions in real time.        
“Andrew, who I met through David, is crazy smart,” Mr. Bogusky said, “and that’s always important.” Mr. Clark and Mr. Littlejohn worked with Mr. Bogusky several months ago on advertising for the SodaStream home soda-making system.        
Mr. Bogusky said that, around the time he left MDC, he believed he was “out of ideas on how to innovate.” But recently, he added, “some potential ways to innovate have come to me through friends who want to do agencies.”        
Although “a lot of people in advertising want to do ads,” Mr. Bogusky said, he preferred to be involved with people who want to “build products that add value to the experience” that consumers have with a brand.        
Mr. Littlejohn, 31, is the chief creative director at Humanaut. Mr. Clark, 33, is the chief strategist.        
“There’s a lot of great things that come along with Alex,” Mr. Littlejohn said. “There are some great connections he’s introduced us to.”        
The name Humanaut is intended to suggest “kind of a human explorer,” Mr. Littlejohn said, “exploring the new frontier of digital and what it means to have these phones in our pockets, these glasses and watches.” He described Humanaut as “a brand invention agency, helping clients invent and innovate, using tools to innovate how people experience a product or business beyond advertising, helping start-ups that lack a brand identity or a brand story.”        
On the agency’s Web site, humanaut.is, which is to go live on Wednesday, are declarations like “We are a creative agency exploring how brands and technology collide with humans.”        
Humanaut is working with clients that include Friends of the Earth and Live Nation. The agency also works on developing and introducing products and brands.        
One such initiative is Felt, an app that mixes high- and low-technology; after users write cards by hand on their iPads, the cards, with accompanying envelopes, are printed, sealed, stamped and mailed through the Postal Service. The Web site describes Felt as “exploring how handwriting and iPads collide with Mother’s Day.”        
Another venture is Swoop, with a goal of enabling mobile users who are at football games, baseball games or other sporting events to sell their seats once they are inside a stadium or arena. Swoop is described on the Web site as “exploring how stadiums and mobile auctions collide with sports fans.”        
“The Humanaut angle is using new technologies to reinvent age-old human experiences,” Mr. Clark said. “A lot of agencies out there are trying to navigate this space.”        
Humanaut has seven employees and, according to Mr. Clark and Mr. Littlejohn, has ambitious growth plans. “We’re looking for designers and writers and developers,” Mr. Littlejohn said.        
Chattanooga is not known for advertising agencies, but then again, neither was Boulder when Crispin Porter & Bogusky decided in 2006 to open an office there that would serve as a dual headquarters for the agency along with its operation in Miami.        
Mr. Littlejohn said he opened Pale Dot Voyage in Chattanooga because he “had some family there,” adding, “There were huge amounts of opportunity and office space for what seemed like pocket change.” Mr. Clark moved to Chattanooga from Chicago to join him in fall 2011.        
Mr. Bogusky called Chattanooga “a great, young market with a lot of cool talent, but affordable.”        
Asked if he was interested in planting more seeds through additional investments in agencies, Mr. Bogusky replied: “I wish I had more of a plan around it, but right now, I don’t. If I do it again, I’d be more formal about it, but I don’t have plans right now to do it again.”

ELBERTON, Ga. — For more than 30 years, the hulking granite slabs inscribed with teachings in eight languages have raised profound and vexing issues: Why are they here? What do they mean? What do they say about life after Doomsday?        


But confronted with a deep and sustained economic slowdown, residents here in the professed Granite Capital of the World are now pondering something a bit more mundane: Is there a way to turn a mysterious 237,746-pound monument known as the Georgia Guidestones into a moneymaker?        
Only one man is said to know the identity of the benefactor who went by the name of R. C. Christian when he visited this East Georgia city in 1979 and paid for the display, supposedly on behalf of a group of others living outside Georgia.        
“I made an oath to that man, and I can’t break that,” said Wyatt Martin, 82, the retired banker who helped broker the arrangement for the monument, which is 19 feet tall and resembles Stonehenge. “No one will ever know.”        
But nearly everyone here has a theory about the artifact, built during the cold war and said to be, at least in part, a guide for civilization’s future in the aftermath of a nuclear attack. Its edicts include a call to “unite humanity with a living new language” and a recommendation to keep the planet’s population below 500 million. (The Census Bureau estimates the world’s population is 7.1 billion.)        
“To some, it’s the holiest spot on earth,” said Hudson Cone, who has tracked the history of the Guidestones since he worked for the Elberton Granite Association, a trade group that some believe ordered the construction to draw attention to the city’s mainstay industry. “To others, it’s a monument to the devil. Take your pick.”        
But if one man here gets his way, that lasting debate could become a spigot of cash for a county of nearly 20,000 people, where unemployment approaches 12 percent and the median household income stands below $33,000.        
“My long-term goal is to build some sort of festival around it, something that would be a weeklong thing that could be held in two or three different spots around Elberton that could really draw in crowds and help the local economy,” said Mart Clamp, a local businessman who helped his father engrave the Guidestones. “There’s a big push right now for the wholesomeness of how small towns operate. People are drawn to that.”        
Mr. Clamp, who has long volunteered to maintain the oft-defaced structure, urged county officials this month to lease him the land where the Guidestones stand so he can mount a campaign to attract more visitors to this area near the South Carolina border.        
There are daunting legal obstacles to Mr. Clamp’s proposal. For starters, the property’s deed bars anyone from charging admission to the Guidestones and bans permanent buildings on the small, county-owned site.        
But there is also early interest, partly because the Guidestones have long attracted visitors, despite the absence of an aggressive campaign to tempt tourists and Elberton’s significant distance from any interstate.        
“It is the most-visited thing that we have in Elbert County,” said Tommy Lyon, the chairman of the County Commission. “We get people coming, so I assume that with the right kind of marketing, it could grow.”        
But even if the Guidestones have proved tantalizing to outsiders, including many from abroad, there are still close-to-home skeptics like Sandy Beggs, an Elberton native who has never been to the site.        
“I just have no desire,” Ms. Beggs said during her shift at her family’s Christian bookstore. “I’ve just always heard bad things.”        
Others in the city cited anecdotes about episodes of witchcraft as their reasons for keeping their distance from Guidestones Road.        
There is widespread curiosity about the donor — reportedly a tall, dapper man with a Midwestern accent who said he devised his pseudonym from his Christian faith. And there is also a consensus that the secrecy surrounding the monument has added to its allure.        
“Whoever came up with this, whatever the reason, whether it was R. C. Christian or whoever, they did a heck of a job,” said Mike Reser, a South Carolina filmmaker who directed a recent documentary about the site. “If they come out and say R. C. Christian was definitely so-and-so, I don’t think anyone would visit the monument. Even if it came out to be someone kind of sensational, it would cause a stir at that time, and then it would die out, and I don’t think the stones would be visited often.”        
But even if Mr. Christian’s identity becomes public, Mr. Clamp said he wants the stones to remain in place, untouched, a local monument, even if one that has not changed the world.        
“It hasn’t really done anything,” he said. “The earth still turns, and Jimmy Hoffa isn’t buried here.”

A bill banning abortions in Albuquerque after 20 weeks of pregnancy will be on the Nov. 19 ballot. The City Council voted 5 to 4 late Monday to put the “Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Ordinance” to a vote. Abortion foes gathered enough petition signatures to require the council to either approve the law or put it to voters. Activists on both sides say it would be the first municipal ban on abortion. “It is a new strategy,” said Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue, which helped push the measure. “There is more than one way to close an abortion clinic.” The measure states that “pain receptors are present throughout the unborn child’s entire body” at 20 weeks.

Coursera and edX, the two largest providers of massive open online courses, or MOOCs, are inching closer to offering degree programs, although the courses so far carry no academic credit. Coursera is now offering courses from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, covering most of its MBA program’s first year curriculum. And Edx is starting two “sequences,” linked courses in a particular discipline.

TORONTO — The anger and clipped comments made by Joe Girardi late Sunday night were gone Tuesday, replaced by calm, subdued remarks.        


For weeks, Girardi has avoided characterizing Yankees games as must-wins because they were not elimination contests. But after Tuesday’s 2-0 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays that sank the team further from the second wild-card berth, Girardi conceded the Yankees are on the verge of missing the postseason.        
“We’re darn close,” he said.        
For a man as angry and disappointed Sunday as he has been all season, his quiet, dejected mood on Tuesday came across almost as resignation to the unsettling reality facing him.        
With only 11 games remaining, the Yankees are tied with the Kansas City Royals, three and a half games behind the Tampa Bay Rays and the Texas Rangers. Two other teams, the Baltimore Orioles and the Cleveland Indians, are ahead of them.        
“We’ve got to go out and win tomorrow, that’s the bottom line,” Girardi said. “We’re getting to where we can’t lose much more.”        
The Yankees entered the series against the last-place Blue Jays hoping for a sweep, not only to wash away the debacle of the lost weekend in Boston, but to enhance their playoff chances.        
Andy Pettitte, the 41-year-old starting pitcher, did his job, but the offense got nowhere against Blue Jays starter R. A. Dickey or the Toronto bullpen. The Yankees managed only five hits for the second straight game, and it seemed as if most of their at-bats against Dickey were over in seconds.        
Alfonso Soriano said the Yankees were flat and low on energy because of having Monday off, and they found it hard to overcome their inertia.        
“Sometimes, you get more tired when you have a day off, especially on the road,” he said. “But I hope tomorrow we have more energy and do those little things that we don’t do tonight.”        
On Sunday, Girardi was incensed at the sloppy play of his team, and told them afterward that he was disappointed in their effort. On Tuesday, he did not seem to question their effort, but Soriano’s comments about absence of energy raise concerns about their seeming lack of urgency.        
After being swept in Boston, the Yankees could at least take refuge in the notion that the Red Sox are the best team in baseball. But the Baltimore Orioles beat the Red Sox at Fenway Park on Tuesday as the Yankees were losing to the worst team in the division.        
“It’s frustrating because I feel like we’re a good club,” Pettitte said. “I feel like we’ve got a real good club. I don’t think that this should be as difficult as it’s been, especially with some of the guys we’ve gotten back in the lineup.”        
Alex Rodriguez, who left Sunday’s game with a strained right calf, was back in the lineup as designated hitter. He went 0 for 4 and ran very slowly to first base.        
Pettitte pitched six and two-thirds innings, allowing one run and six hits — a home run to Colby Rasmus in the fourth. He was growing exhausted heading into the seventh, especially with the quick half-innings that Dickey was working, but Girardi sent him out again. After Josh Thole made an out, Girardi came to the mound and checked in with Pettitte again. He said he was fine to face Jose Reyes, and he did, forcing Reyes to hit a fly ball for an out with his 110th pitch.        
Girardi went back to the mound and summoned Shawn Kelley, who gave up a home run to Rajai Davis on his second pitch. The way the Yankees’ offense was sputtering, there was little hope for a comeback.        
Before the game, Girardi said he always tried to maintain a positive outlook. No matter how frustrated he was after Sunday’s loss, he still woke up the next morning with a smile on his face, he said, because the team still had an opportunity.        
But if the losses continue, it will not be long before Girardi’s opportunities to wake up with a smile are eliminated, along with the Yankees.        
“Every game is very crucial,” Rodriguez said. “It’s not like we’re going to get mulligans for these, so we’ve got to make them count.”        
INSIDE PITCH        
Boone Logan said a CT scan taken Monday revealed a bone spur in his left elbow. He rejoined the team Tuesday with the hope of pitching through the discomfort. Logan said he would need surgery after the season, but would try to help the Yankees in their final push for the postseason. Logan, who will be a free agent after the season, called the timing unfortunate. He said that he planned to throw a bullpen session Wednesday and hoped to be available Friday, when the Yankees open a three-game series against the San Francisco Giants at Yankee Stadium. ... Austin Romine, who is recovering from a concussion, was originally in the starting lineup Monday, but after working out in the early afternoon he told Joe Girardi that he did not feel he was ready to play. Romine was replaced by Chris Stewart. “He just feels like he’s not ready to go,” Girardi said.

HUDSON, N.Y. — When a fledgling magazine gets former President Bill Clinton to contribute an article, you would think he would be featured on the cover. But the cover model for the current issue of the quarterly Modern Farmer is a sleepy-looking goat. Mr. Clinton is mentioned between articles on outer space farming and soil cuisine.        


The magazine, which offers advice on building a corn maze and articles on the effect of climate change on lettuce and oysters, is trying to carve out a new niche on the newsstand. It edges into the food magazine sphere with luminous photography of vegetables, while articles report on straight agricultural topics more often found in farming publications like the 111-year-old Successful Farming.        
Modern Farmer, which began publication in April, is trying to benefit from the first signs of growth in the total number of farms since World War II and the farm-to-table food trend that has fueled growth for farmers’ markets and community-supported agriculture. That means the magazine has attracted readers who include an Amish farmer and vegetable supplier to Whole Foods, Brooklyn rooftop farmers harvesting kale and broccoli and myriad young farmers going back to the land.        
“I know they’re trying to reach people like me and the kind of hobbyists and the people who are just kind of enamored with the idea of farming,” said Courtney Cowgill, a 33-year-old co-owner of the Prairie Heritage Farm near Power, Mont., who formerly wrote about agriculture and other topics for The Associated Press. To appeal to the person who wants to romanticize farming and the person who is knee deep in turkey droppings “is hard, and I think they’re balancing that,” she said.        
It helps that Modern Farmer explores a subject on the minds of some of the world’s wealthiest people. Ann Marie Gardner, the founder and editor in chief, conceived the idea for a magazine in 2011 after she noticed that sources she interviewed for Monocle magazine seemed preoccupied by agricultural issues. In spring 2012, Ms. Gardner, who previously worked for The New York Times and Tatler magazine, started to pitch an idea to investors. Frank Giustra, the Canadian mining billionaire and former chairman of Lion’s Gate Entertainment, who had started to produce award-winning olive oil in Umbria, Italy, took an interest in Ms. Gardner’s project. By November, he gave her enough money (she would not divulge figures) to start a Web site, and a print magazine.        
“He was very interested in food investments,” Ms. Gardner said as she sat in her sun-dappled second-floor offices beneath a Pilates studio and above the Face Shop, which sells skin care products, along Hudson’s main strip. “It sat between his media interests and investments and his newfound food investments.”        
The magazine has also attracted surprising financial support from advertisers eager to sell trucks, tractors, organic wine and work clothes to these young farmers. Sean O’Brien, global director of footwear for the Original Muck Boot Company, based in Smithfield, R.I., has advertised in both Modern Farmer issues.        
“It’s really targeted almost a new consumer group for us,” Mr. O’Brien said. “We sell a lot of boots to farmers and workers and outdoorsmen. You can look at a Modern Farmer as almost a hobby farmer. This a perfect vehicle to target that key consumer group.”        
Ms. Gardner has been quick to nurture her powerful supporters on the editorial and business sides. She asked Mr. Giustra to let one of her reporters travel with him and Mr. Clinton, whose foundation has benefited from Mr. Giustra’s friendship and largess, when they visited Peru and Colombia in May. He declined, but instead she was able to arrange for the former president to contribute an article. He wrote about the work his foundation has been doing with farmers globally, like helping fisherman along Colombia’s coast get their fish into restaurants. Mr. Clinton also offered his own recollections of helping his Uncle Buddy tend his farm plot in Arkansas.        
“As a young boy, I picked beans, corn and tomatoes, poured tubs of water into sandy soil to grow large watermelons, fed animals and badly lost a head-butting contest to a ram,” wrote Mr. Clinton, whose foundation staff worked with Ms. Gardner on the article.        
Ms. Gardner seeks business guidance daily from Rob Withers, managing director of Fiore Capital and part of Mr. Giustra’s team. Mr. Giustra declined to comment. Ms. Gardner said she hoped to find a strategic investor to help support the magazine. She said she also hoped soon to add a chief technology officer to her nine-member staff and to hold farming conferences.        
The magazine has attracted a global following with the first print edition being sold in Britain, Germany and Australia as well as in the United States, according to Modern Farmer’s spokeswoman, Jessie Cohen. Traffic on the  Web site, which went live in April, grew to 99,000 unique visitors in the United States in July, according to comScore. The first print issue sold 35,000 copies on newsstands and 13,000 by subscription.        
Modern Farmer joins a surprisingly robust genre of farming magazines. The Alliance for Audited Media tracks 20 farming magazines in the United States and Canada and their circulation in the last three years has held strong. Scott Mortimer, publisher and general manager at Meredith Corporation, which includes Successful Farming, notes that grain prices are rising, land prices are at historical highs and the technology to produce crops has improved.        
Ms. Gardner may find that some of her biggest critics are not battle-hardened media types, but farmers. Allan Van Tassel, an 83-year-old lifelong farmer who is Ms. Gardner’s neighbor, tells her regularly that the magazine does not have a chance of survival.        
“It’s a nice idea,” Mr. Van Tassel said. “But as I say, you drive up and down the road and you see these small conglomerates where they’re going to raise things one year, two years. Then they’re gone.”        
Ms. Gardner does not discredit the perils of either publishing or farming. While Modern Farmer slowly and steadily progressed last year, a windstorm wiped out her entire crop of pears. This year, as she has logged long hours making Modern Farmer grow, her own garden has become overgrown. Eventually, she placed her trust in a professional.        
“I brought in a farmer to help me,” Ms. Gardner said.

When he was mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani refused to meet with the Rev. Al Sharpton, who in turn was a fierce and unrelenting critic of Mr. Giuliani’s administration.        


But on Tuesday night, Joseph J. Lhota, a former Giuliani aide who is now running for mayor, visited Mr. Sharpton at the Harlem headquarters of his civil rights organization, the National Action Network.        
Mr. Lhota and his wife, Tamra, met privately for about a half-hour with Mr. Sharpton and two officials from the organization. Mr. Sharpton listened from behind his desk, reclining slightly in a plush high-backed chair; Mr. Lhota sat across from him, behind a coffee table stocked with bottled water.        
For Mr. Lhota, fresh off his victory in the Republican primary last week, the visit was largely symbolic, meant to show his willingness to reach out to leaders around the city, even those in communities that are highly unlikely to support a Republican candidate for mayor.        
“I believe in an open-door policy,” Mr. Lhota told reporters afterward, promising that his meeting with Mr. Sharpton was “the first of many discussions” between them.        
Mr. Sharpton acknowledged that he and Mr. Lhota disagreed on some issues, such as the city’s use of stop-and-frisk policing tactics. But he said he was encouraged by their first meeting.        
“He’s willing to defend and to say what he believes in front of any audience in the city, even though he knows it may be an audience that doesn’t agree with him,” Mr. Sharpton said. “I think that’s a good opening.”        
The meeting offered a reminder of how Mr. Lhota’s relationship with Mr. Giuliani can be a useful asset in some settings, but a perilous liability in others.        
In the Republican primary, Mr. Lhota highlighted Mr. Giuliani’s support of his candidacy, and Mr. Lhota’s leading opponent, John A. Catsimatidis, frequently complained that he felt as if he was running against Mr. Giuliani, who remains popular with Republicans.        
But now Mr. Lhota, who will need the support of Democratic voters in order to win the general election in November, is trying to make clear that he is different from Mr. Giuliani because many voters are not eager to see a repeat of that administration.        
In a WNBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Tuesday, 51 percent of voters said Mr. Giuliani’s backing made them less likely to vote for Mr. Lhota, compared with only 29 percent who said it made them more likely to support him.        
No one seemed eager to revive any past battles. Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Lhota appeared cordial, if not affectionate. After their meeting, they stood side by side taking questions from reporters.        
They said that they had spoken about policing and education, and that Mr. Lhota had promised to address a future gathering of the National Action Network.        
Mr. Lhota acknowledged that he was frequently asked if his mayoralty would represent “the third term of Rudy Giuliani.”        
“It’ll be the first term of Joe Lhota,” he said. Asked about Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Sharpton declined to compare Mr. Lhota with the former mayor, and at one point joked that because of old age, he could not remember the time before Michael R. Bloomberg was mayor.        
“I’m not here to take shots,” Mr. Sharpton said. “Everyone knows my views on Mr. Giuliani, and his on me.”

ATLANTA — The police on Tuesday released a recording of the 911 call from a panicked Charlotte, N.C., homeowner that led to the death of a 24-year-old black man at the hands of an officer who shot him 10 times.        


The car of the man, Jonathan Ferrell, went off the road at about 2 a.m. Saturday in a Charlotte subdivision. He kicked out the back window and made his way to the woman’s house, banging on her door, the police said.        
In the 17-minute recording, a terrified woman who was home alone with a baby and a dog pleaded for the police to hurry after she told them she had opened her door to find a stranger she initially described only as a black man. “He’s in the front yard yelling,” the woman says in the recording. “Oh my God. Please. Oh my God. I can’t believe I opened the door. What is wrong with me?”        
After about 11 minutes, as the woman searched for her husband’s gun and spoke with her alarm company, three officers arrived and then quickly ran down the street. About six minutes later, the dispatcher mentioned that a medic was on the way.        
Lawyers for the officer who fired the shots, Randall Kerrick, 27, made their first court appearance on Tuesday. Officer Kerrick, who was charged with voluntary manslaughter, has not yet entered a plea.        
Michael J. Greene, a former prosecutor who is representing Officer Kerrick, issued a statement saying only that Mr. Kerrick’s actions were justified. His next court appearance is Oct. 7.        
Officer Kerrick, who is white, joined the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department in 2011 after working for a year in the animal control division.        
The Charlotte chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. called for the charges to be raised to murder. The number of bullets from one officer “indicates more than a reflex,” Kojo Nantambu, the organization’s president, told a local television station. “It smells more of hatred and rage, which shows that Mr. Kerrick was predisposed in killing a black man and did so with extreme prejudice.""        
Mr. Ferrell grew up in Tallahassee, Fla., in a family of five children and went on to play football for Florida A&M. He had recently moved to Charlotte to be with his fiancée and was working two retail jobs and preparing to go back to college.        
The police said that he had gotten lost after dropping off a friend, and that alcohol did not appear to be a factor.

It took only one pitch Tuesday night for the Texas Rangers to take the lead in a game for the first time in more than a week.        


Ian Kinsler drove Jeremy Hellickson’s first fastball for a home run, and the visiting Rangers went on to beat the Tampa Bay Rays, 7-1, breaking a seven-game losing streak.        
Elvis Andrus said he felt it from the on-deck circle.        
“I think the homer by Ian made the whole team just relax,” he said. “We haven’t scored first in a little while.”        
Kinsler and Andrus homered and drove in three runs each to help the Rangers pull even with the Rays at the top of the American League wild-card race.        
Rangers Manager Ron Washington said, “You’ve got to have a sense of relief when you lose seven in a row and you know you’re a better team than that.”        
Kinsler’s 12th home run ended a streak of seven homerless games for the Rangers, their longest in 23 years.        
Alexi Ogando (7-4) won in his first start since Aug. 13, giving up two hits in five innings.        
ORIOLES 3, RED SOX 2 Danny Valencia tripled to stop closer Koji Uehara’s streak of 37 outs in the ninth inning, and Matt Wieters had the go-ahead sacrifice fly as Baltimore beat Boston at Fenway Park. The Orioles overcame a 2-0 deficit on Brian Roberts’s run-scoring groundout in the fifth and Chris Davis’s 51st home run of the season in the sixth that tied the score. Davis broke the club record set by Brady Anderson in 1996.        
Uehara (4-1) fell four outs short of Bobby Jenks’s major league record for a reliever of 41 consecutive retired batters set in 2007, and Mark Buehrle’s mark for all pitchers of 45 in 2009. The run was the first off Uehara in 302/3 innings and ended a streak of 27 scoreless outings since July 9.        
TIGERS 6, MARINERS 2 Miguel Cabrera homered, Austin Jackson hit a two-run single and host Detroit held on despite a short-handed bullpen. The Tigers were without closer Joaquin Benoit and the left-handed reliever Drew Smyly. Both had the night off. Anibal Sanchez struck out 10 in six and a third innings, but Seattle tied the score, 2-2, against him in the seventh, forcing Detroit’s relievers into action.        
CARDINALS 11, ROCKIES 4 Matt Holliday had four hits, including a two-run homer, to help visiting St. Louis take sole possession of first place in the National League Central with a victory over Colorado. The Cardinals entered the night tied with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Joe Kelly (9-4) baffled the Rockies as he allowed three hits over five sharp innings before turning a 10-0 lead over to the bullpen.        
PADRES 5, PIRATES 2 Jedd Gyorko blasted a three-run homer among his three hits and San Diego defeated host Pittsburgh. Ronny Cedeno added three hits for the Padres, who put a dent in Pittsburgh’s pursuit of its first N.L. Central title. Luke Gregerson pitched the ninth for his fourth save.        
Eric Stults (9-13) allowed two runs over five innings.        
NATIONALS SWEEP BRAVES Tanner Roark threw seven shutout innings, and host Washington topped Atlanta, 4-0, in the second game of a day-night doubleheader. Roark (7-0) allowed 2 hits, struck out 6 and retired the final 13 batters he faced. Ryan Zimmerman hit a home run, Ian Desmond hit a run-scoring double and Adam LaRoche hit a single for a run in the eighth inning for the Nationals.        
In the first game, a grounder by the Nationals’ Denard Span bounced through the legs of Braves shortstop Andrelton Simmons for a game-ending, two-run error. The Nationals won, 6-5. Pinch-hitter Chad Tracy had a run-scoring grounder against Craig Kimbrel in the three-run ninth. It was Kimbrel’s first blown save since May 7.        
PHILLIES 6, MARLINS 4 Chase Utley hit a three-run homer and drove in four, Roy Halladay tossed six effective innings and host Philadelphia topped Miami. Halladay (4-4) allowed one run and four hits in his fifth start after returning from shoulder surgery. The top three hitters in Philadelphia’s lineup — Cesar Hernandez, Jimmy Rollins and Utley — were 8 for 12 with four runs batted in and six runs.        
BREWERS 4, CUBS 3 Pinch-hitter Logan Schafer dropped a suicide squeeze bunt with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth to give Milwaukee a victory over Chicago. Carlos Gomez drove in three runs for Milwaukee with a two-run homer and a sacrifice fly.        
REDS 10, ASTROS 0 Jay Bruce hit a grand slam and had five runs batted in, Mike Leake pitched eight scoreless innings and Cincinnati cruised to a win over host Houston, handing the Astros their 100th loss. The Astros are the first major league team to lose at least 100 games in three straight seasons since Kansas City from 2004-6. Leake (14-6) allowed five hits over eight innings and struck out six with two walks.        
WHITE SOX 4, TWINS 3 Dayan Viciedo had three hits and drove in two runs and Jose Quintana pitched six effective innings as host Chicago topped Minnesota. Quintana (8-6) allowed a run and eight hits. He struck out five and walked two. Brian Dozier had three hits and scored two runs for the Twins, who have lost six of seven.

Amy Adams is Julie Powell, who for one year works her way through “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” (Child was the principal author) and blogs about it. “By now this actress has exhausted every superlative that exists, and to suggest that she has outdone herself is only to say that she’s done it again,” A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, said of Ms. Streep. “Her performance goes beyond physical imitation, though she has the rounded shoulders and the fluting voice down perfectly.” And though Ms. Adams may have been outmatched by Ms. Streep, Mr. Scott called Stanley Tucci, as Child’s husband, Paul, impeccable.

(FX) MONEYBALL (2011) Brad Pitt, below, received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics who transformed the team — with one of the lowest payrolls in baseball — into a contender against wealthier franchises by rethinking everything he had been taught about the game in this fictionalized adaptation of the book by Michael Lewis. Jonah Hill, also nominated, plays Peter Brand, a computer whiz and a disciple of Bill James, the statistician who devised new ways to interpret baseball data. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is the team’s manager, Art Howe, who isn’t about to buy into the approach that Beane and Brand insist will create a winner.

Magazine,"










When Elizabeth Gilbert was in fourth grade, her teacher, Ms. Sandie Carpenter, announced a fund-raiser. Students were asked to sell grinders — New Englandese for “sub sandwiches” — to pay for a class trip. There was never any question whether Gilbert would participate. Still, door-to-door sales of a perishable foodstuff can prove intimidating, even to a zealous 9-year-old.        


So her mother, Carole, initiated a training program. She made Gilbert go outside and close the front door. Gilbert then had to knock, introduce herself and explain what she was selling and why. “Our family’s going on vacation next week,” Carole might announce. “What if we want the grinders two weeks from now?” To which Gilbert would generally respond, “I don’t know!” and start crying. “Back it up,” her mother would say. “Try it again. Get it right, kid.” And close the door.        
They did this, Gilbert recalls, for what felt like a whole afternoon.        
A decade and a half later, Gilbert took an elevator up to the offices of Spin magazine to ask for a job. Her only connection at the magazine was having met the publisher, Bob Guccione Jr., at a party once. She had no experience as a journalist — her degree from N.Y.U. was in international relations — and enough good sense to be terrified. The doors to the elevator opened. Gilbert took a deep breath. Come on, she told herself. You’re Carole Gilbert’s daughter. Go do this!        
The receptionist was, to put it gently, unmoved by her appeal. A concerned secretary appeared, then a personal assistant. Gilbert politely refused to budge. Guccione eventually agreed to see her but had no recollection of having met her. Look, he said finally, my assistant is going out of town for three days. You can do his job. At the end of this stint, Guccione pulled out his wallet, handed Gilbert 300 bucks and wished her good luck.        
Some months later, Gilbert placed her first short story in Esquire, which published it with the subtitle “the debut of an American writer.” She sent the story to Guccione with a note that read, “I told you I was a writer!” He called and offered her an assignment on the spot.        
The lesson was obvious. Life was just a big grinder sale. Your job was to knock on the door and not to leave until your ambitions were met.        
Next month, Viking will publish Gilbert’s sixth book, a novel titled “The Signature of All Things.” It is her first work of fiction in 13 years and unlike anything she has ever written. The book’s heroine is Alma Whittaker, the brilliant, restless daughter of an imperious botanical explorer. Its prose has the elegant sheen of a 19th-century epic, but its concerns — the intersection of science and faith, the feminine struggle for fulfillment, the dubious rise of the pharmaceutical industry — are essentially modern.        
What sets Gilbert, 44, apart from other novelists, of course, is that she’s best known in the world at large as the author of “Eat, Pray, Love,” an account of her spiritual journey from depression to enlightenment spiced by its exotic locales. The 2006 memoir sold a gazillion copies, spawned a movie starring Julia Roberts, made Gilbert the unwitting guru to her predominantly female fans and more or less devoured her literary reputation.        
Despite having spent the first decade of her career writing three critically acclaimed books, critics cast her as a pampered solipsist peddling self-help. “Even worse — chick lit, if you really want to get ghetto,” Gilbert says. “What little respect I clawed my way to, I totally erased.”        
Her overriding concern in those years, though, was living up to her own professed grace. She received mountains of letters from anguished fans and for a time tried to answer every one personally. And she struggled with the crushing expectations that acclaim bequeaths. “The biggest thing I had to prove was, ‘Is she going to be able to come out of this tsunami and ever do anything again?’ Or am I going to Harper Lee out? Go J. D. Salinger for the rest of my life?”        
She began researching a novel about the Amazon but abandoned it after her lover Jose Nunes — the sexy Brazilian gem trader known as Felipe in “Eat, Pray, Love” — was deported. The only way Nunes would be allowed to return to the States was if Gilbert married him, an unsettling prospect given the haunting failure of her first marriage. To sort out her complicated feelings about matrimony, Gilbert resolved to write about the subject. As a midlist author, she’d rarely felt self-conscious at the keyboard. As a cultural icon, the pressures of undertaking another memoir activated her most primal fear: that she would disappoint people. “Committed” wound up being her most arduous project. When it was published, in 2010, she felt more apprehension than elation. “I threw it out into the world like a grenade. I was like, ‘All right, everybody, whatever you have to say about the last book, whatever resentment you’ve built up over the last few years, let’s just catharsis it out and move on.’ And it did that.”

BEIJING — A year after their China sales were battered by protests in a territorial dispute, Japan’s big automakers are finding it tough to bounce back in the Chinese market. In particular, they are struggling where demand for cars is rising fastest — in provinces where anti-Japan sentiment historically runs deepest, a legacy of Japanese occupation around World War II.         
In relatively more Japan-friendly parts of southern China like Guangdong, Toyota Motor, Nissan Motor and Honda Motor are returning to sales levels near those seen before a diplomatic row last September over a group of rocky, uninhabited islets in the sea between China and Japan.        
A tougher challenge for the Japanese brands are the coastal and northeastern provinces like Shandong, which overtook Guangdong as China’s biggest car market in 2009, Zhejiang and Jiangsu — part of a large swathe of the country that Japan invaded and occupied during the late 1930s.        
Over the past decade, Japanese automakers set up a strong base in Guangdong, investing heavily in factories that now form an assembly cluster fed by Japanese parts suppliers in the area. According to R.L. Polk & Company, an industry consultant, Japanese cars had 41 percent of the market in Guangdong in 2011, though that share has dipped a few percentage points since the dispute last year.        
But northern and eastern provinces are now eclipsing Guangdong in car demand. Polk said Guangdong had been overtaken by Shandong and Jiangsu, and its ranking as third was under threat from Zhejiang and Hebei, which also were occupied by Japan more than 70 years ago.        
“It’s a smoldering brush fire today but could turn into a big five-alarm fire if Japanese automakers don’t deal with it,” said Yale Zhang, head of Automotive Foresight, a consultant based in Shanghai. “As demand in mega-markets like Beijing slows significantly, Toyota and other Japanese brands need to penetrate even deeper into the Chinese market.”        
Protests erupted across China a year ago after Japan nationalized some of the disputed islets, known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan, by buying them from a private owner. As passions ran high, thousands of Japanese-branded cars were vandalized, and dealerships were attacked by mobs in Qingdao, a major city in Shandong, as well as in other cities.        
In a widely reported incident in mid-September last year, a 51-year-old Chinese man with his family drove his Toyota Corolla past an anti-Japanese demonstration in Xian in Shaanxi Province. The car was surrounded by protesters and the man was so badly beaten that he was partly paralyzed, and his car destroyed.        
Sales of Japanese-branded cars plunged by more than half in September and October from year-earlier levels and remained weak well into the first half of this year.        
Though sales of Japanese cars are picking up in the south and southeast, sales executives said recovery was frustratingly slow farther north in Jiangsu, Anhui and Shaanxi. A Nissan sales executive based in Guangzhou said the attack on the driver in Xian had been especially damaging, as it had scared Chinese buyers away from Japanese cars. “Recovery in Shaanxi is the slowest for us,” the executive said, asking not to be named because business was still sensitive to the issue.        
“We also have to deal with negative campaigns by dealers representing Western brands,” he said, referring to some local dealers who tell customers it is unpatriotic or unsafe to own a Japanese car in China.        
Song Fangjie, a 28-year-old construction supervisor from Jinan, Shandong’s provincial capital, said he liked Japanese cars’ fuel economy, but had chosen a Volkswagen for its safety. “If Japanese carmakers offer better service, I might think about buying one,” he said, though he recounted how a friend had been refused service at a gasoline station because he was driving a Japanese car.        
At Toyota, some executives question whether it is wise to pour resources into competition in these hostile markets.

KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban killed a senior Afghan election official on Wednesday and then boasted about it on Twitter, in what officials said was the first attack by the insurgents on an official of the Independent Election Commission in recent years.        


The deputy police chief in Kunduz Province, Ebadullah Talwar, said that two men riding on a motorcycle opened fire on Mohammad Amanullah, the head of the Kunduz office of the commission, at 8:45 a.m., and that he died at a hospital.        
Within an hour, Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, was on Twitter to claim the attack.        
“At 9 a.m. this morning, Engineer Mohammad Aman head of Kunduz Independent Election Commission was killed by our Mujahedeen in Takharistan area of Kunduz city,” the Taliban tweet read, using a shortened version of the victim’s name. It was apparently the first time the Taliban had used Twitter to officially claim responsibility for an assassination.        
A spokesman for the commission in Kabul confirmed the killing but said that, despite the Taliban claim, it was too early to conclude who was behind Mr. Amanullah’s killing.        
“We will wait until the investigation is completed by the security organs and then say who was behind this attack,” said Noor Ahmad Noor, a spokesman for the commission.        
Mr. Amanullah had run the commission’s office in the northern province of Kunduz since 2003, Mr. Noor said. “He was a noble person and a good colleague,” he said.        
The insurgents’ effort to draw attention to its assassination of an election official may mean the group has decided to try to disrupt the elections more vigorously than they have in the past.        
“The Taliban commit such acts to prevent our people from becoming empowered and developed, so that the foreigners can determine our destiny,” President Hamid Karzai said in a statement condemning the killing. “An inclusive election will be held in this country, and the enemy’s plots against that will fail, and nothing will remain to the Taliban except denigration and disgrace.”        
Although the election for president, as well as for provincial council members, is not until April 5, the three-week period for candidates to declare for president began Monday. So far, no one has made such a declaration as political coalitions jockey among themselves to decide whom to support.        
Increased violence toward election officials could deter some voters from the polls for an election that is considered an important milestone by the international community as foreign military forces withdraw.        
Last March, the Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, denounced the planned elections, calling them “a waste of time, nothing more.”        
“As to the deceiving drama under the name of elections 2014, our pious people will not tire themselves out, nor will they participate in it,” Mr. Omar said in a statement e-mailed to journalists last March.        
However, the Taliban leader did not explicitly threaten election workers, and during previous election campaigns officials with the election commission were not singled out for attack.        
“We did not have any cases of attacks on I.E.C. staff in at least the past two years,” Mr. Noor said.        
Officials of the commission have had far more problems from government harassment in past years, but the current panel has been criticized by opponents as being dominated by political appointees close to Mr. Karzai. The head of the panel, Mohammad Yousef Nuristani, for instance, is a former spokesman for the president.        
Only a few weeks ago, the election commission announced that it faced a critical shortage of women to carry out body searches at female polling stations to deter suicide bombings.        
Mr. Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, has long used the Internet to distribute his messages, through Web sites, a Google e-mail account and Facebook pages. His Twitter account was opened on Aug. 26, 2012, and in recent months has become much more active.        
Most of his 1,468 followers are journalists, along with a smattering of Western military and diplomatic officials.

WASHINGTON — President Obama tried to raise the pressure on Republicans in Congress on Wednesday, telling a national business group that threats of a fiscal default by his political adversaries risk throwing the United States economy back into crisis.        


Mr. Obama used an appearance before the group, the Business Roundtable, to call out House Republicans who have said they will not raise the nation’s debt ceiling unless they succeeded in repealing Mr. Obama’s signature health care law.        
In his remarks, Mr. Obama accused what he called “a faction” of Republicans in the House of trying to “extort” him by refusing to raise the nation’s debt ceiling unless the president’s health care plan is repealed.        
“You have never in the history of the United States seen the threat of not raising the debt ceiling to extort a president or a governing party,” Mr. Obama said. “It’s irresponsible.”        
Mr. Obama called upon the business leaders to try to convince lawmakers to avoid the kind of “brinksmanship” that would lead to promises of “apocalypse” every few months.        
“What I will not do is to create a habit, a pattern whereby the full faith and credit of the united states ends up being a bargaining chip to make policy,” he said.        
“I’m tired of it,” he added. “And I suspect you are too.”        
Congress will soon face two major budget deadlines. The stopgap “continuing resolution” that finances the federal government runs out at the end of September, and the Treasury Department has said that unless Congress raises the debt ceiling, it expects to lose the ability to pay the government’s bills in mid-October.        
The Republican House speaker, John A. Boehner, has argued that the debt limit should be increased only as part of broader concessions by the president to reduce the deficit and make other spending reforms.        
But a group of conservative Tea Party Republicans want to go further by explicitly refusing to raise the debt ceiling without repealing the health care law. Mr. Obama made it clear on Wednesday that he had no intention of negotiating over the debt limit.        
Mr. Obama also raised the specter of another economic downturn if Republicans do not raise the debt ceiling, aides said, and he noted that in 2011 — the last time Washington clashed over a debt ceiling increase — the stock market dropped 17 percent, the country’s credit rating was downgraded and consumer confidence dropped.        
So far, the two sides are far apart and barely talking. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that conversations between the White House and Capitol Hill were continuing. But he did not offer any concrete evidence of high-level efforts to reach a compromise on fiscal issues.        
“We have made clear our willingness to be reasonable and compromise,” Mr. Carney told reporters. “What we haven’t seen thus far is anything from the Republicans that represents a similar willingness to compromise when it comes to a broader, more comprehensive budget agreement.”        
Mr. Boehner said that presidents and Congress had negotiated over the debt limit for decades, mentioning agreements under several former presidents. He also noted that Mr. Obama himself reached a deal with Republicans to increase the debt ceiling in exchange for concessions.        
“No one is threatening to default,” said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner. “The president only uses these scare tactics to avoid having to show the courage needed to deal with our coming debt crisis. Every major deficit deal in the last 30 years has been tied to a debt-limit increase, and this time should be no different.”

BEIJING — Security forces in China’s far western Xinjiang region last month shot and killed at least 12 men and wounded 20 others during a raid on what the authorities described as a terrorist facility, Radio Free Asia reported Wednesday.        


The killings took place more than three weeks ago in a small village near the city of Kashgar, but details emerged only in recent days. Local officials told Radio Free Asia that the men had been building and testing explosives at a desert encampment in the village, Jigdejay; local police officers, reached by telephone Wednesday, declined to comment or said they knew nothing about the raid.        
The raid comes at a time of escalating tension between the Chinese authorities and the region’s ethnic Uighurs, a Muslim, Turkic-speaking people who have long complained of restrictive policies they say are aimed at curtailing their language and religious practices. Since June, at least 100 people have been killed during clashes in the oasis towns and cities that hug the vast Taklamakan Desert in southern Xinjiang, home to the majority of China’s nine million Uighurs.        
Although some of the violence has involved Uighurs’ attacking Han Chinese in what analysts describe as improvised acts of ethnic bloodletting, exile groups and human rights organizations say much of the bloodshed has resulted from harsh police tactics against protests and unauthorized religious gatherings. Chinese officials usually describe the same incidents as acts of terrorism by “separatists” or religious extremists, although they rarely provide details or evidence to back up these claims.        
As with much of the recent violence in Xinjiang, the Chinese state media did not cover the raid on Aug. 23 in Jigdejay, and many of the details remained murky. Local officials and residents told Radio Free Asia that dozens of armed police officers swarmed a covert munitions center where about 30 men had gathered.        
One resident said the police were tipped off to the presence of the encampment after a rocket launcher the men were trying to build accidentally exploded, killing one of them. “They were hiding inside there and practicing how to make some sort of explosives,” Yasin Ahun-Karim, a local religious leader, told Radio Free Asia, which is financed by the American government. “Their activities were discovered by a police helicopter, and police acted immediately to clean up the place.”        
Another resident who witnessed the raid said the dead were buried on the spot.        
The raid on the desert encampment followed another deadly raid three days earlier in nearby Yilkiqi township, where at least 15 Uighur men were shot and killed as they prayed together. The authorities described the dead as terrorists engaged in “illegal religious activities” and said they were training for an attack, although the only weapons recovered at the scene were knives and axes.        
In recent weeks, the authorities have been announcing stiff sentences for those arrested during the latest spate of unrest. Last week, three Uighur men were sentenced to death for their role in a bloody clash in Lukchun township last spring that left as many as 46 people dead. In August, two other men were given the death penalty for another clash near Kashgar that killed at least 21 people.

BEIJING — A verdict and sentence in the case of Bo Xilai, the former high-ranking official whose downfall shook the Communist Party, will be announced Sunday, Chinese authorities said on Wednesday.        


A short statement from the court in the city of Jinan in Shandong Province, where Mr. Bo’s trial was held in August, said it would pronounce judgment on Mr. Bo, who is accused of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.        
Political analysts said they expected Mr. Bo to be found guilty and receive a lengthy prison sentence. Estimates of his sentence ranged from 15 to 20 years at the low end to life in prison. It is highly unlikely that he will receive the death penalty, they said.        
Mr. Bo, the former party chief in the city of Chongqing, fell from power in March 2012, weeks after his former police chief fled to an American consulate with accusations that Mr. Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, was involved in the murder of Neil Heywood, a British family associate. Ms. Gu was found guilty last year of killing Mr. Heywood and received a suspended death sentence.        
During his five-day trial last month, Mr. Bo denied having received $3.56 million from two businessmen. He was allowed to defend himself, and he and his lawyers were permitted to cross-examine witnesses.        
Transcripts of the trial were made public, including descriptions of squabbles within the Bo family and the upscale lifestyle of Ms. Gu and the couple’s son, Bo Guagua.        
But some sections of the transcript, in which Mr. Bo described pressure by Communist Party investigators to confess, were kept out of the public record.        
Since the trial, legal scholars in China have debated whether its relative transparency will contribute to any progress toward establishing an independent judiciary with due process, or whether it amounted to political theater used by the party for its own ends.        
Since the trial, other senior figures have been accused of corruption, including Jiang Jiemin, a Central Committee member close to Zhou Yongkang, the country’s former security chief and an ally of Mr. Bo. Mr. Jiang was fired from his job overseeing state-owned corporations earlier this month.

LONDON — When you play in the Champions League and both the history of your club and the size of your salary exceed those of every other competitor in the game, you need to put on one heck of a show.        


Cristiano Ronaldo did exactly that on Tuesday night.        
On Sunday, he signed a new contract committing the rest of his athletic prime to Real Madrid. A bespectacled Ronaldo and a seemingly grateful club president, Florentino Pérez, completed the deal in a televised event in the stands of Bernabéu Stadium.        
It is reported that the figures guarantee Ronaldo a post-tax salary of €21 million, about $28 million, for each of the next five years.        
About 48 hours after signing the deal, Ronaldo got down to business. He dispensed with the glasses and wore what might have been his Superman costume.        
Real Madrid is synonymous with European club glory. Its mammoth spending over the years is geared, above all, to get the elusive “La Décima.” That is the quest to do what no other team has done and win the European Cup (now the Champions League) for a 10th time.        
The problem is that other teams, like Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester United, along with new pretenders like Manchester City, Paris St.-Germain and Juventus, want the same prize. And Madrid has been dreaming about La Décima for 12 seasons now, but has not won it yet.        
If ever there was a statement of intent, Tuesday provided it.        
Man United and P.S.G. hit four goals apiece. Man City and Bayern opened up with three goals. Money and power talk in the Champions League.        
And Cristiano Ronaldo and Madrid talked loudest.        
The team had a more than difficult task on the first night of the tournament, with an away game in the Ali Sami Yen Sports Complex, which is Galatasaray’s home in Istanbul. Not only are you on the edge of Asia there, you are in a cauldron that seethes with hostility. Real lost on its previous visit there in the Champions League last season, although that was a second-leg encounter and Madrid had a sufficient lead to withstand the defeat.        
For 20 minutes, the crowd roared. The home side, with the former Champions League victors Didier Drogba and Wesley Sneijder in its distinctive red and amber colors, put Real on the back foot. Madrid’s goalie, Iker Casillas, made a save but was soon replaced after damaging a rib in collision with his own defender, Sergio Ramos.        
Still Galatasaray dominated. But you cannot sustain domination without taking opportunities against a team like Madrid. Felipe Melo, a Brazilian in Gala’s midfield, either hesitated when his chances came or was thwarted by Casilles’ deputy, Diego López.        
Then the game turned. After 33 minutes, Isco, a young Spaniard also acquired at great cost in the summer, showed stealth and strength in equal proportions in holding off defender Emmanuel Eboué and scoring with perfect precision off the base of a post.        
Then, with Drogba off after injuring a shoulder and Gala’s other striker, Burak Yilmaz, missing a header from seven yards, the concentration and the fighting spirit drained from the Turkish champion. It was alarming to see it, and Fatih Terim, the brimstone-and-fire home coach, did not mask his dismay.        
“We lost the game in a terrible way,” he concluded. “We suddenly conceded goals for no apparent reason. My players gave up the game, both physically and in terms of morale.”        
Didn’t they. Melo’s careless header at 54 minutes opened up his defense for Karim Benzema to strike the second goal, and Ronaldo did the rest.        
The Portuguese picked apart the remnants of Galatasaray’s resistance. He scored twice with quick reactions to stray balls in the home side’s confused goalmouth. He combined with the substitute Gareth Bale to set up another easy strike for Benzema.        
And then, the game already won, Ronaldo adorned the evening with his masterpiece. His feet danced and his composure shone as he wove his way through three defenders — Selcuk Inan, Aurélien Chedjou and Dany Nounkeu.        
These are big men, but Ronaldo cannot be bullied, and for sure his quality is bigger than theirs.        
When he was done twisting them this way and that, he smote the ball with such velocity that it was in the net before the goalie could even dream of getting a hand to it.        
And CR7, the striker of 206 goals in 204 games since joining Real in 2009, walked off with the game ball. He has scored 21 hat tricks for Real and is chasing down the legends of Alfredo Di Stéfano and Raúl for the club’s scoring records. And his contract and prowess suggest he will get there.        
But will he get Madrid La Décima?        
In Manchester, another big player, Wayne Rooney scored only two goals in Tuesday’s 4-2 victory over Bayer Leverkusen. After unsuccessfully trying to engineer a move to Chelsea just a month ago, Rooney was the catalyst, the driving force, the energetic game-winner on Tuesday, surpassing even his strike partner, Robin van Persie.        
Rooney scored twice and created the third. He ran until the Germans wilted and the Old Trafford crowd, which believed him gone in the summer, rose in mass applause when he left the field just before the end.        
There is a small matter of the Manchester derby – United versus City – this coming weekend. And with City breaking its barren run in European competition by winning, 3-0, in Plzen on Tuesday, both sides will be up for the contest this Sunday.        
Speaking of being up for things, Bayern Munich is the reigning continental champion. There had been murmurs from within the camp that the club’s flow and fierce willpower were not the same under Pep Guardiola, the former Barcelona man who took over after Bayern retired last season’s title-winning coach, Jupp Heynckes.        
Bayern’s sporting director, Matthias Sammer, had goaded the team with comments about “lackluster” effort. The response was that the champion came out to dispose of CSKA Moscow, 3-0, with goals from David Alaba, Mario Mandzukic and Arjen Robben.        
“The team picked up tonight where they left off at Wembley,” said Munich’s chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Wembley was where Bayern became European champion last May.

Suzy Menkes talked recently with Jonathan Saunders, one of the rising young designers in London and winner of the Emerging Talent Award for men’s wear in the 2012 British Fashion Awards.        


Q. Jonathan Saunders, you have won an award as a breakthrough men’s wear designer, meaning that after just two years of doing men’s wear, you are top of the pile. How do you feel? 
A. Well, I feel privileged. I think that the wonderful thing about men’s wear is that I love doing it. You know, it’s a joy.        
Women’s wear is something that is my passion, and I have done it since I graduated college. But something that reminds me of when I was a furniture designer, reminds me of men’s wear. It is very product-led. It’s very much about the clothing as individual pieces, and you work in a different way when you’re working on men’s. It allows me to do something that I really miss and that’s why I love it so much.        
Q. So as a young Scottish boy, what was the trajectory that brought you to this award, to design for both men and women? 
A. Well, you know, I wasn’t a kid that was brought up drawing dresses and aspiring to be a fashion designer.        
I went to Glasgow School of Art. I studied furniture design. I loved working with marquetry and paneling of woods and colors and all those different things, just making things. And that’s how I started. And it started off as women’s wear, but because of that I think it’s quite a natural progression into men’s, you know. It’s a pragmatic approach to design as opposed to the fantastical way we fantasize about women’s wear. And although it’s similar and it’s passionate and it’s a joy to work on, it’s very much a more simplistic way of working. I think that it’s, for me personally, a relief — if that makes sense.        
Q. I think of your work as very linear, very graphic and a lot of patterns when you were working with Alexander McQueen. So where did that come from? Did you as a child see a lot of pattern and print? Is that the start of it? 
A. Yeah, I was always interested in fine art. I always wanted to be an artist. And I am not saying that what I do now is anywhere remotely near that.        
But I love the Bauhaus, I love the idea of that movement where people got together and they thought about things in a new way and they tried new techniques and they were very process-led. And that is what I was always inspired by. I didn’t think of myself as an artist. I wanted to make things, but I didn’t really know in which medium to do it. So I kind of tried and tested different ways of doing it.        
When I went to Saint Martins, I met Louise Wilson. So my folio was a bunch of album covers, copy and pasted and stuck together with Sellotape, of David Bowie and colors of Pink Floyd and a montage of all different ideas — but it wasn’t anything real. And she just let me do what I wanted to do and she believed in me and said, ‘O.K., so if you want to be a fashion designer, do it in your own way and try it out.’        
That, for me, was the starting point. I think because of that, it’s quite easy to translate into women’s wear or men’s wear or interiors — or whatever it is as a creative project, I just love making stuff, basically.        
Q. You had some fantastic support, not least from Samantha Cameron, the wife of the British prime minister — and she not only wears your dresses, but she gave a tipoff to Michelle Obama. 
A. : That’s kind of wonderful isn’t it? I think, from a Scotsman, from a council estate in Glasgow, it’s pretty good going.        
I think what’s wonderful about Samantha is that she loves Britain and she loves the creative industries in Britain and she’s happy to promote it and I think that that is what we’re all about these days. Whether it’s London Men’s or London Fashion Week, all of us are trying to make ourselves not only innovators, in terms of ideas, but businesses. And something to come and see from a business perspective. I think what Samantha does and what Michelle has done is really help support all of us, which is brilliant.        
Q. But tell us how it happened. So did Samantha Cameron just take a dress over and put it in front of Michelle Obama and say ‘You’ve got to look at this guy. He’s brilliant.’? 
A. Well, Michelle, I think, buys her own clothes. She goes to a shop in Chicago called Ikram and she buys things that she loves. And that’s what I love about any kind of person that is wearing your clothes. You know, if somebody has picked it out themselves and somebody appreciates it — whether it’s everybody’s taste it doesn’t matter.        
And that’s what I saw happen with Michelle, and I think that’s what happened with Samantha. And I think that, you know, print and color is something that is what I love and if it suits somebody for a Tuesday evening, then that’s perfect.        
Q. Kate Middleton is somebody else that has worn your clothes. Do you feel an affinity with these people? Do you actually relate to them or do you just see them wearing your clothes? 
A. I appreciate anybody making the choice to wear something that I’ve designed. I always felt like when I started, that I was kind of learning as I go.        
In London, what’s wonderful about it is that you start from college, you do it from your bedroom and all of a sudden, you’re on the Internet and people know what you’re doing. And to be quite frank, you don’t really know what you’re doing and you kind of wing it for a couple of years, and you try to pretend that you know what you’re doing and you learn it as you go.        
I think that what’s wonderful about London is that it supports designers, like that to be able to do that. In no other city in the world could you do it from nothing. You know, you get £500 from the bank, you do a collection and you get supported from Fashion East or the British Fashion Council or whatever it is.        
And we all manage to do our own collections and start that way. I think we learn how to be designers in a very different way from the rest of the world. I think that is something to be celebrated about. I think that those people that wear it are advocators for that.        
Q. When it comes to designing men’s wear, is it a very different process for you? It seems to me now that men’s wear is very hot that a lot of people are much more interested than they were. It’s become almost as universal for men to look for new fashion as it is for women to do so. 
A. Men’s wear is a very exciting business to be involved in. I think that guys want to look different. They don’t want to look generic, which is a changed thing. Because previously, I know growing up in Glasgow, if you looked anything from the norm, you were in trouble.        
I think that guys are pragmatic and they’re practical and they look at the details on a cuff and they look at the detail in the inside of something, they feel how comfortable it is. They don’t want to go through torture wearing something for the evening and they’re very conscious of it. I am as a person, let alone designer.        
You know, when a guy really does not put up with much that teaches you about being a good designer, it teaches you about how to work with fabrics and how to make something work for a person and, you know, it’s been inspiring for me to learn about it.

LELYSTAD, Netherlands — On an open plain in front of us are hundreds of horses. Most of them are gray with black manes and tails. Their heads look more like those of their wild cousins, zebras, than those of riding horses. Some even show what may be a vestigial stripe on their flanks.         
“We could be in the Serengeti,” says Hans Breeveld, my guide, referring to the plain in Tanzania that is a haven to wildlife.        
Well, we almost could. To the north we encounter another big group of large animals, this time red deer does with their young. They gaze at us and bleat like sheep.        
Off in the distance are massive cattle with imposing horizontal horns that look like they might have walked out of a cave painting. Every now and then, a brown harrier, a large and rare raptor, floats by, and we glimpse a white-tailed eagle, another species unusual in most of Europe, perched on a dead tree.        
Rather than Africa, we are in the Netherlands, one of the most densely populated countries in Europe, at a place called the Oostvaardersplassen. This stretch of swamp and grassland of more than 6,000 hectares, or about 15,000 acres, is just a 45-minute train ride from Amsterdam. And it is the site of a remarkable and controversial experiment that has been the subject of intense national debate and has grabbed the attention of experts in international wildlife management and animal welfare.        
This wild area started as low-lying polder, land that was reclaimed from the sea in the late 1960s. Mr. Breeveld, who has worked as a ranger in the Oostvaardersplassen for about 30 years, explained that the idea was to put light industry here, but the recession hit and investors did not come.        
In the meantime, a small group of scientists and bird watchers noticed that the marshy area was attracting species like egrets that had become rare or had vanished from the Netherlands. Something special was transpiring.        
“This gave a window into what large parts of the Netherlands looked like in the past,” said Frans Vera, an ecologist who has been an advocate for the reserve.        
Mr. Vera and his allies pushed for an unusual form of management, which, as much as possible, allows nature to take its course.        
A bold and persuasive thinker, Mr. Vera argued that the grassy areas should be cropped not by domestic sheep and cattle but by beasts resembling their wild ancestors. As these species were extinct, he settled on konik horses, Polish descendants of the tarpan, and Heck cattle, which had been bred in Germany in an attempt to recreate the aurochs.        
Small groups of these animals, as well as red deer, were introduced in the 1980s and 1990s. By three years ago, their numbers had soared to a total of about 4,000, with deer by far the most numerous. In the last couple of years, there has been a decline, with about 2,700 animals counted in April before the breeding season.        
As in the Serengeti or any other natural ecosytem, a large proportion of the animals die each year. But the deaths at Oostvaardersplassen, mostly because of starvation when food runs out in the winter, have turned out to be enormously controversial in the Netherlands. The preserve became a subject of intense political debate in the news media and government in the harsh winters earlier this century.        
While access to the Oostvaardersplassen is restricted, trains run frequently along the perimeter of the area, giving passengers a view of dead animals or whatever else is transpiring.        
“A lot of people were visually confronted with dying animals in the winter,” said Frauke Ohl, a professor of animal welfare at Utrecht University. “It is an unusual thing that people can see these things happen.”        
Critics, including animal welfare advocates and hunting groups, argue that to allow animals that are fenced in — albeit in a large enclosure — to starve is cruel and immoral and that the numbers need to be proactively reduced. “Hundreds of horses, cattle and deer die each year from famine,” said Maarten Frankenhuis, a veterinarian and a former director of the Artis Zoo in Amsterdam. “This project is our national shame.”

Let it be known that the Tough Drake era begins not this week, with the release of “Nothing Was the Same,” the first official Tough Drake album, but rather began all the way back on Jan. 6, 2012. That day saw the release of the video for “Stay Schemin,” a Rick Ross song featuring Drake and French Montana. The clip is a fuzzy Michael Mann rip-off, nighttime Miami reduced to blacks, grays and electric blues, oozing sinister energy.        


In it, Drake dons a black sweatshirt, black jeans, black boots and a gold chain. He spends most of his verse staring hard into the camera, his eyebrows barely moving. He gestures brusquely with a bandanna in his right hand. And he delivers what is easily the most tart, harsh, menacing verse of his career: “Might look light, but we heavy though.”        
This came not even two months after the release of “Take Care,” Drake’s masterpiece album of sensitivity and recrimination, and it read like an almost total repudiation of it. That album was a bloodletting of heartbreak and anxieties, while “Stay Schemin” was a firm punch to the jaw that became a staple at the same time as some purple songs from “Take Care.” Not only was Drake writing his own narrative, he was also writing his own counternarrative. It’s difficult to tell which of those is now the main plot — both are in play on “Nothing Was the Same” (Young Money/Cash Money/Republic), Drake’s third excellent major-label album, and the first to come as he is firmly ensconced in hip-hop’s top tier.        
Before, he was an interloper effecting seismic change in hip-hop, thanks to his dismantling of the usual facades of acquisitiveness and fearlessness. Building on Kanye West’s template of ambivalence, Drake took Mr. West’s self-examination and stripped it of all its agitation, preserving only the emotional turmoil. He wanted success, and was aware of his more conventional competition, but his concerns were primarily internal.        
But Drake is on top now, the genre’s stylistic standard-bearer and its most reliable and versatile hit maker, and his concerns have shifted accordingly. On “Nothing Was the Same” Drake broods like before, sure, but also puffs his chest in equal measure. He’s always used his music to send messages to women who’ve broken his heart, or whom he just couldn’t hold tight enough. Now he’s got something to lord over them, too.        
The musical choices are familiar — hazy, often doleful post-soul and low-end-heavy hip-hop, largely moving slowly and with deliberateness. Most of the album is produced by Drake’s longtime associate 40, who’s sticking close to the sound that’s become their joint signature. The aching hit “Hold On, We’re Going Home” recalls “Find Your Love,” from 2010; “Pound Cake” is reminiscent of “Dreams Money Can Buy,” from 2011.        
The most noticeable change in Drake over the last couple of years has been physical, not musical: suddenly he’s muscled, full of hard angles. The eyes remain soft, but everything around them has been remade. This is the externalization of the bravado that is now an essential part of his music — he’s bragged plenty before, but now it has weight. (It’s probably worth mentioning the New York nightclub altercation between Drake’s crew and Chris Brown’s crew in June 2012; when Drake spoke of it in a recent GQ interview, he had an ominous air, as if anticipating how things could get worse.)        
But muscles aside, there’s no real physicality to Drake’s toughness. It’s a psychological evolution more than anything, the result of accepting his stature as reality, not just a dream. In the past, laying himself bare has been the most natural thing. But when you’re the object of ire and jealousy, the apt response is to flash teeth and snarl a bit.        
The “Nothing Was the Same” tough talk began several months ago with the release of “Started From the Bottom” — like most of Drake’s opening album singles, it’s far more muscular than what appears on the rest of the album. It’s rousing and victorious — “There ain’t really much out here that’s popping off without us” — and also a bit malevolent.        
That was one of several songs, dating back to “Stay Schemin,” in which Drake put up his dukes and prepared for a fight: the baleful “5AM in Toronto,” or his verse on the remix to “Versace” by Migos (“This year I’m eating your food and my table got so many plates on it”), or the joyful flexing on ASAP Rocky’s single, the unprintable title of which shortens to “Problems.”

JAKARTA, Indonesia — When the Asian financial crisis hit in 1997, sales plummeted 95 percent and stayed down for six months at the IGP Group, Indonesia’s dominant manufacturer of car and truck axles. Four-fifths of the company’s workers lost their jobs.         
When the global financial crisis began in 2008, IGP’s sales briefly dropped nearly one-third, and a quarter of the employees were put out of work.        
The latest downturn, which began in early August, has been much more modest. IGP’s axle shipments are down 10 percent in the last month from a year ago. The company’s work force has barely shrunk, to 2,000 from 2,077 at the end of July, though IGP plans to reach 1,900 by the end of this year.        
“These are challenging times, but I don’t think they will be the same as in 2008 or 1998,” Kusharijono, IGP’s operations director, who uses only one name, yelled over a clanking, cream-colored assembly line here for minivan rear axles.        
From Indonesia and India to Turkey and Brazil, capital flight from developing economies to the United States is already causing hardship for millions of businesses and workers. More was expected if the Federal Reserve decided to retreat from its economic stimulus campaign of buying billions of dollars in bonds each month.        
That it decided on Wednesday not to stop may relieve some companies, government leaders and economists who worried that rising interest rates in the United States would draw tens of billions of dollars out of emerging markets and cause local currencies to fall further against the dollar.        
Investors have been moving money into dollar-based investments that offer higher yields.        
But the Fed’s announcement Wednesday afternoon took currency traders by surprise, and the dollar plunged against major currencies. The dollar fell a little more than 1 percent against the euro and the yen after the announcement, giving companies in the developing economies a little more breathing room. On Thursday, currencies in Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, which have fallen sharply in recent months, headed higher, with the Indonesian rupiah gaining about 1.5 percent against the dollar by late morning in Asia.        
The economic slowdowns in the developing economies seem less severe so far than in other recent downturns. While previous exoduses by investors from volatile emerging markets have caused waves of bank failures, corporate bankruptcies and mass layoffs, the latest retrenchment has been much milder so far. That partly reflects the belief that when the Fed does move, it will scale back its bond purchases very gradually, business leaders and economists around the world said in interviews this week. The effects have also been limited partly because banks, companies and their regulators in many emerging markets have become much more careful about borrowing in dollars over the last two decades, except when they expect dollar revenue with which to repay these debts.        
In 1997 and 1998, “the whole problem began with the banking sector. Now I think the banking sector is much better,” said Sofjan Wanandi, a tycoon who is the chairman of the Indonesian Employers’ Association and part owner of IGP.        
Trading in currency and stock markets seems to suggest that some of the worst fears over the summer are starting to recede. The Brazilian real has recovered about 8 percent of its value against the dollar since Aug. 21 and a little over a third of its losses since the start of May, when worries began to spread about the vulnerability of emerging markets to a tightening of monetary policy. Stock markets from India to South Africa have rallied from lows in late August, with Johannesburg’s market up 14.7 percent since late June after a swoon earlier than most emerging markets.        
“While the Fed hasn’t started the tapering process as yet, there has been a considerable withdrawal of money in the emerging markets and especially in India since May. In my opinion, the major effect has already taken place,” said Sujan Hajra, the chief economist at AnandRathi, an investment bank based in Mumbai.        
One lingering question is how much inflation will accelerate in emerging markets. Many of their industries depend heavily on commodities like oil that are priced in dollars.

This week’s Ask an Expert features Orfeu Marcello Buxton,  a neuroscientist who will answer questions about the causes and health consequences of sleep deficiency, particularly in middle age. He researches chronic sleep deficiency in the workplace and home and how it contributes to disorders like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.        


Dr. Buxton is an associate neuroscientist the Division of Sleep Medicine in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, as well as an assistant professor  at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health. He received his doctorate from Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.        
Dr. Buxton notes that adults can express their priorities “in what we don’t do,” and too often sleep (along with healthy behavior) gets short-changed. But sleep, he says, is a foundation of healthy aging and a source of resilience. His research, for example, has shown that sleep restriction or disruption increases obesity and diabetes risk, by decreasing insulin secretion, increasing blood glucose levels slowing metabolism (the study is here). He has also found that characteristics of the work environment, including managers’ actions, can affect sleep (study is here).        
Here are examples of some questions that Dr. Buxton is prepared to answer. (Note: Dr. Buxton is a researcher, not a physician, and he emphasizes that his responses should not take the place of recommendations from your health care provider.)  
1. Why is sleep important?        
2. What are some mechanisms by which sleep affects metabolism, and obesity and diabetes risk?        
3. Why do we now think that work or the workplace affect sleep?        
Please leave your questions in the comments section. [Update: Part 1 of Dr. Buxton’s responses can be found here.]

1913 Brilliant Ball Is Given in Mid-Ocean 
NEW YORK — Judge Elbert H. Gary, chairman of the board of directors of the United States Steel Corporation, estimates the wealth represented by the passengers who attended the ball aboard the steamship Imperator on the sixth day out from Hamburg on her recent westward trip at $850,000,000. The ball was described by passengers who landed last night [Sept. 17] as a spectacle of extraordinary brilliancy, which would have been exceptional even if it had been given in a great hotel on land after weeks of preparation.        
 
1938 Ministers Agree to Press Prague 
LONDON — Yesterday’s [Sept. 18] momentous consultation at 10 Downing Street between the heads of the British and French governments ended after midnight in a tentative decision to put heavy pressure upon Czechoslovakia to yield to Chancellor Adolf Hitler’s demands for annexation of the Sudeten Deutsch areas by Germany. The decision is subject to ratification today by the French Cabinet. It was learned that the results of yesterday’s deliberations would appear to be a complete Anglo-French surrender to Herr Hitler’s semi-ultimatum.        
 
1963 U.K. May Cut Ties With Indonesia 
LONDON — Britain may break diplomatic relations with Indonesia if President Sukarno does not promptly hobble his mobs, reliable sources here said tonight [Sept. 18]. Enraged by a mob’s destruction of its embassy in Djakarta, an attack on a British consulate and seizures of some British firms, Britain sharply told the Indonesian government today to halt such “uncivilized and barbaric behavior” immediately and to protect British citizens and property. If President Sukarno does not agree promptly to these demands, Britain may break diplomatic relations with his country.

Tired of being thrust onto the front lines of the nation’s debate over guns, Starbucks is asking customers to leave firearms behind when they are in its stores and its outdoor seating areas.        


The policy change came after a shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday that left 13 people, including the gunman, dead. But Starbucks said its decision was not in response to that or to the shooting spree that killed 26 children and adults at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., just days before Christmas last year.        
“I’ve spent a significant amount of personal time on this issue in the last several months and I’ve seen the emotionally charged nature of this issue and how polarizing it is on both sides,” Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, said in a telephone interview. “Nevertheless, customers in many stores have been jarred and fairly uncomfortable to see guns in our stores, not understanding the issue and feeling that guns should not be part of the Starbucks experience, especially when small kids are around.”        
Under the change, baristas and other store employees will not ask customers who come in with guns in holsters, say, to leave or confront them in any way, Mr. Schultz said. No signs explaining the policy will be posted in Starbucks stores, either.        
“We are going to serve them as we would serve anyone else,” he said. “There are going to be people on both sides who will be disappointed or angry, but we’re making a decision we think is in the best interests of our customers, employees and the company.” He said store officials would evaluate compliance over time and consider posting signs if necessary.        
A majority of company-owned Starbucks stores are in states that allow people to openly carry guns, although restrictions and limitations vary from state to state. The company has had a handful of armed robberies in its stores over the years, as well as two recent incidents where guns carried in women’s purses have discharged accidentally, but little other gun violence in its stores.        
Under its previous policy, however, Starbucks has been unwillingly co-opted by proponents of “open carry” policies and vilified by those seeking stricter laws on gun ownership. Garry Trudeau devoted six consecutive days of his Doonesbury comic strip in 2010 to mocking the company’s stance, which opened with a barista greeting a customer in a plaid flannel shirt and saying, “Welcome to Starbucks, sir. Would you be openly carrying a weapon today?”        
“Pro-gun activists have used our stores as a political stage for media events misleadingly called ‘Starbucks Appreciation Days’ that disingenuously portray Starbucks as a champion of open carry,” Mr. Schultz wrote in an open letter to be published in ads in major newspapers.        
Last month, Starbucks closed a store in Newtown early after gun rights supporters wearing camouflage and Connecticut Citizens Defense League T-shirts held one of their events there.        
Similarly, opponents of military-style assault weapons in stores, like the group  Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, which advocated “Skip Starbucks Sundays,” have staged protests outside Starbucks stores and urged consumers to boycott the company.        
In 2010, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence teamed with Credo Action, an activist group that uses mobile technology and social media to push change, and attracted more than 40,000 signatures on a petition aimed at changing the company’s policy on guns in its stores that was delivered to Starbucks headquarters in Seattle.        
“It sounds like Howard Schultz is making a very good business decision,” said Brian Malte, director of legislation and mobilization at the Brady Campaign. “Lots of families with children, college students and young people are Starbucks customers, and they want to feel safe.”        
The company has long followed local laws regarding the ability to carry guns in plain sight. Customers in the 44 states that allow legal gun owners to carry weapons openly have been permitted in its stores there, while those in the six other states — New York, California, South Carolina, Illinois, Florida and Texas — have not, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.        
“I want to make it very clear that Starbucks is not a policy maker and as a company we are not pro- or anti-gun,” Mr. Schultz said. “However, there have been a number of episodes over the course of the last few months that have put us in a position to take a big step back and assess the issue of open carry.”        
Most other restaurant chains and retailers follow policies similar to the one Starbucks is abandoning, although Peet’s Coffee and Tea and California Pizza Kitchen ban guns from their stores altogether. Disney also forbids guns in its theme parks, and Costco does not allow its members to carry them openly in its stores.        
“While Peet’s Coffee and Tea respects and values all individuals’ rights under the law, like many other private retail establishments, our policy is not to allow customers carrying firearms in our stores or on our outdoor seating premises unless they are uniformed or identified law enforcement officers,” the company said in a statement forwarded by a spokeswoman.        
A spokeswoman for the National Restaurant Association said the organization did not have a list of its members’ policies on guns but noted that some states that have open carry laws on the books still prohibit public display of firearms in restaurants.

WASHINGTON — President Obama’s first two defense secretaries publicly questioned the administration’s handling of the Syrian crisis on Tuesday night and expressed skepticism about whether Russia can broker a deal to remove Syria’s chemical weapons.        


In a joint appearance in Dallas, both former Pentagon chiefs, Robert M. Gates and Leon E. Panetta, were critical of Mr. Obama for asking Congress to authorize the use of force against Syria in retaliation over its use of chemical weapons. But they disagreed on whether military action would be an effective response. Mr. Gates said Mr. Obama’s proposed military strike was a mistake, while Mr. Panetta said it was a mistake not to carry out an attack.        
“My bottom line is that I believe that to blow a bunch of stuff up over a couple days, to underscore or validate a point or a principle, is not a strategy,” Mr. Gates said during a forum at Southern Methodist University. “If we launch a military attack, in the eyes of a lot of people we become the villain instead of Assad,” he added, referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.        
Mr. Gates, the only cabinet member from the administration of George W. Bush whom Mr. Obama asked to stay, said missile strikes on Syria “would be throwing gasoline on a very complex fire in the Middle East.”        
“Haven’t Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya taught us something about the unintended consequences of military action once it’s launched?” Mr. Gates said.        
Mr. Panetta, also speaking at the forum, said the president should have kept his word after he had pledged action if Syria used chemical weapons.        
“When the president of the United States draws a red line, the credibility of this country is dependent on him backing up his word,” Mr. Panetta said.        
“Once the president came to that conclusion, then he should have directed limited action, going after Assad, to make very clear to the world that when we draw a line and we give our word,” then “we back it up,” Mr. Panetta said.        
Mr. Gates and Mr. Panetta made their most extensive comments on current national security policy — and certainly their most critical statements on policies of the administration they both served — since leaving public service. Both former secretaries have announced plans to publish memoirs expected to shine more light on the internal policy debates of their tenures. Neither expressed a specific reason for breaking their silence on the Obama administration’s decisions Tuesday night.        
Asked about the comments at a news conference on Wednesday, the current defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, said he had “the greatest respect” for his two predecessors, but added, “Obviously, I don’t agree with their perspectives.”        
Another former high-ranking Obama administration official, Michael J. Morell, who recently retired as the deputy director of the C.I.A., also expressed skepticism about the negotiations brokered by Russia.        
“I think this is the Syrians playing for time,” Mr. Morell told Foreign Policy 
magazine in an interview published Tuesday on its Web site. “I do not believe that they would seriously consider giving up their chemical weapons.”        
Mr. Gates said he doubted whether President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was sincere in his efforts to broker a deal, and said he was skeptical that the Syrian government would disarm. He said it was absurd that Syria needed days or weeks to identify the location and size of its chemical weapons arsenal, and he suggested that the timetable should be an ultimatum of 48 hours.        
When asked whether the West should trust Mr. Putin, Mr. Gates said, “Are you kidding me?”        
He advocated identifying credible partners within the Syrian opposition and increasing support, including weapons — but not surface-to-air missiles, which could be seized by militants for terrorist acts against civilian aviation.        
He also supported a strategy of sanctions that labeled members of the Assad government as war criminals, with the threat of arrest if they left Syria, and suggested sanctions on Assad family members living or studying overseas, including on their financial holdings. Such pressure might prompt some in the inner circle to negotiate an end to the civil war, Mr. Gates said.        
Although Mr. Gates said that any unilateral military action against Syria would be a mistake, he also said it was unwise for the president to have sought Congressional authorization to use force, because of the risk to presidential prestige if he was rebuffed.        
If Congress voted no, “it would weaken him,” Mr. Gates said. “It would weaken our country. It would weaken us in the eyes of our allies, as well as our adversaries around the world.”        
Under questioning from the moderator, David Gergen, who advised four presidents and is now on the faculty at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, both former secretaries said that American credibility on Syria was essential to enduring efforts to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.        
“Iran is paying very close attention to what we’re doing,” Mr. Panetta said. “There’s no question in my mind they’re looking at the situation, and what they are seeing right now is an element of weakness.”        
Mr. Panetta said that the president “has to retain the responsibility and the authority on this issue,” and that it was wrong to “subcontract” the decision to Congress. “Mr. President, this Congress has a hard time agreeing as to what the time of day is,” he said.

LONDON — “I have big plans,” Mimi Watstein announces.        


Ms. Watstein, a Boston resident who works by day in the arts, is at other times a “power user” on Fancy.com, a shopping Web site where customers shop directly from others’ wish lists.        
Her list, labeled studiomimi, has about 43,000 followers who await her recommendations on swimwear, heels and other products. What started as a hobby is now “a brand,” Ms. Watstein says. “I could put what you see here into a boutique.”        
Studiomimi is the 54th most popular site on Fancy.com — not insignificant when you consider the site has eight million users and generates more than $100,000 in sales per day.        
Ms. Watstein is just one of the legions of “influencers,” consumers who are transforming the way others buy fashion and the way fashion is sold.        
“I define an influencer as someone who has a social media following of more than 3,000 on any given network,” says Macala Wright, founder of Why This Way, a Los Angeles-based digital strategy company. “But it’s not enough to have a big following; they have to drive conversation. Their influence is proved by others’ digital interaction such as retweets and ‘likes.”’        
Although Ms. Watstein says she is not making any money, she sees studiomimi as her “virtual nest egg — I envision a place where I parlay this hard work into a payoff.”        
Ms. Wright says that many of these people are getting free products or getting paid and that they have the ability to make “a lot of money — these people are as important as bloggers now.”        
And don’t the brands know it. “Brands are realizing that influencers are more powerful than an advert,” explains Lucie Greene, an editor at the Future Laboratory, a forecasting agency in London. “You can make the consumer sell stuff for you.”        
Ms. Watstein says brands now send her marketing material in the hope that their products make the grade; some have approached her for collaborations.        
It’s a growing trend that is democratizing e-commerce. “Influence used to be owned by a small group of people,” says Chris Morton, chief of Lyst.com, which applies Twitter’s “following” concept to shopping — allowing someone to buy fashion selected by chosen tastemakers. “Thanks to social media, that influence can be global or local, celebrity or friend. The barriers have been demolished. All you have to do is have a point of view.”        
Lyst’s 2013 sales are estimated to reach $25 million, a big jump from the $750,000 it tallied in 2011.        
The key — both to other consumers and to marketers — is that recommendations are between peers. “Our peers are our greatest asset,” says Ms. Wright. “They’re in our lives because they’re like-minded.” And the trust inherent in a peer’s recommendation can do wonders for a product’s sales.        
Influencers seem to be particularly effective in fashion. According to the Danish branding expert Martin Lindstrom, fashion tops the list of commodities where social influence is more powerful online than offline.        
“Fashion is such an ostentatious consumer pastime, there is the need for constant feedback. This is a way to get it,” explains Ms. Greene.        
And most of the people involved in this culture are “millennials,” those born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s. “They’re huge networkers who love to show off,” she says.        
Of particular interest to brands are the consumer “advocates” — people of influence who happen to love a particular brand. “They spend 13 percent more than the average buyer on goods in general,” Ms. Wright explains, “and when they refer a friend to a retailer, the friend will spend almost half of what the advocate spends.”        
A recent report on social sharing by the Future Foundation, a British trend-spotting agency, states: “Brand strategists are devoting ever more energy to campaigns designed to convert the well-connected social networker into that fabled being — the brand ambassador.”        
Its author, Jason Mander, predicts that over the next two years, brands will be luring a lot of these consumers into becoming ambassadors.

U.S. stocks rallied to record highs on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve surprised investors and decided against trimming its bond-buying stimulus program, which has fueled Wall Street’s rally of more than 20 percent this year.         
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 20.67 points, or 1.21 percent, at 1,725.43. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 146.44 points, or 0.94 percent, at 15,676.17, and the Nasdaq Composite Index was up 37.94 points, or 1.01 percent, at 3,783.64.        
Most market participants were expecting the central bank to begin a withdrawal of the bond-buying program by about $10 billion a month.        
The committee said it saw recent economic data “as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.” However, the statement continued, “The committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases.”        
Investors had been hesitant to make big bets ahead of what is expected to be the first tentative step by the Federal Reserve to wean the world off its stimulus program that has helped prop up the American economy and equity markets for much of the year.        
Traders had generally expected the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee to make modest cuts to its $85 billion in monthly asset buying, so the decision to keep the program intact, at least for now, came as a surprise.        
Many equity options traders appear less worried by the Federal Reserve’s announcement than by Washington’s looming debt and budget battles. Hedges on volatility have been on the rise, but those bets do not look to be specifically tied to the Fed.        
European shares were mostly higher, and the FTSEurofirst 300 closed up 0.4 percent, near a five-year closing high hit on Monday.        
Markets in other kinds of assets were also suggesting that investors were not too worried about the Fed announcement. The dollar held near a four-week trough against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday, as investors bet that any move by the Federal Reserve to roll back stimulus would be modest.        
Adobe Systems, known for its Photoshop and Acrobat software, said it expected subscriber growth to top the 331,000 it added in the third quarter because of strong demand from corporate customers. The stock was up 9.2 percent.        
FedEx, the courier company, posted a bigger quarterly profit as it cut costs and its lower-priced ground shipping business did well, sending its shares up 6 percent.

New York City Opera opened its season on Tuesday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with the eagerly anticipated American premiere of the brilliant British composer Mark-Anthony Turnage’s “Anna Nicole.” Yes, that Anna Nicole. This audacious, entertaining and, in its strange way, wrenching opera tells of the real-life Playboy Playmate, reality television star and fortune hunter Anna Nicole Smith.        


Yet hovering over this exhilarating coproduction with the Brooklyn Academy is the sad realization that “Anna Nicole” could also be the only production of City Opera’s current season, or even possibly the final offering in the history of this valued 70-year-old company.        
George Steel, City Opera’s general manager and artistic director, recently announced that, though all seven performances of “Anna Nicole” would take place, the company would not be able to present three other scheduled productions this season unless it could raise $7 million by the end of this month. He added that the company needed another $13 million by year’s end to proceed with plans for 2014-15. If the rest of this season and all of the next are canceled, it is hard to imagine how the “people’s opera” could ever re-emerge.        
Many longtime supporters of the company are distressed by the programming cutbacks in recent years and by Mr. Steel’s decision to abandon Lincoln Center and instead present productions in various Manhattan and Brooklyn locales, which he asserts is more affordable.        
Several productions Mr. Steel presented during his two seasons at Lincoln Center’s renovated David H. Koch Theater and two nomadic seasons were innovative and exciting. But it has been hard for him to project a vision for City Opera when the company has no home and the offerings are so few.        
“Anna Nicole” shows what we will be missing if City Opera folds. The work was commissioned by the Royal Opera in London and had its premiere at Covent Garden in February 2011. I attended that premiere fearing the worst. I thought that Mr. Turnage, his librettist, Richard Thomas, (best known for writing and composing “Jerry Springer: The Opera”), and the director, Richard Jones, would just make fun of Smith.        
I was wrong. The three creators, all British, certainly had fun depicting Smith’s tawdry American life and skewering reality television. But their Anna emerged as an improbable operatic heroine; a restless woman yearning to escape her backwater birthplace, Mexia, Tex.; a striver determined to get ahead and raise a son in any way possible. Isn’t this the American dream?        
The Royal Opera production, with brash, neon-lighted sets by Miriam Buether and colorful, garish costumes by Nicky Gillibrand, looks great on the stage at the Brooklyn Academy. In this swiftly paced, two-act opera, Anna’s story is told in flashbacks, framed by a series of television interviews. It begins with a gaggle of reporters who, like a Greek chorus come to tabloid journalism, fill us in on the background story. Mr. Thomas’s words bop along, often in loosely rhymed couplets. The language is clever and crass, and Mr. Turnage sets the chorus’s words in sputtering bursts of block chords.        
Anna, the appealing soprano Sarah Joy Miller, first appears, her blond locks flowing, sitting in a golden chair amid the reporters. Ms. Miller’s voice sometimes seems light for Anna’s intense outbursts, and her top notes are occasionally tight. But she easily dispatches the coloratura filigree of the vocal writing and brings sensual warmth and yearning to her winning performance.        
You feel for this Anna when she sings of her oppressive childhood, with a brutish father (the burly-voiced James Barbour); a foul-mouthed mother (the indomitable mezzo-soprano Susan Bickley), who made young Anna swipe toilet rolls from fast-food joints; and sundry relatives, including a female cousin who “has five kids and no teeth.”        
“Anna Nicole” has prompted much talk in the opera world for the raunchiness of its libretto and the scenes of sex and drugs. Yet every time the piece threatens to slip into smutty humor, the creators, especially Mr. Turnage, tap the depth and sadness of Anna’s story. A brainy modernist but also a lifelong jazz fan, Mr. Turnage has written a score that bristles with jazzy energy, touches of sardonic cabaret and stretches of bittersweet waltzes. The music’s harmonic complexity and textural richness humanize Anna and reach tragic realms in the final scenes. The conductor, Steven Sloane, drew pulsing, feisty and textured playing from the orchestra. The overall performance was marred, though, by what sounded like occasional feedback and crackling from an amplification system that seemed to include microphones on individual singers.        
When Anna — having married Billy, a guy she met working at a fried-chicken place, and given birth to a boy — heads to Houston, the “city of joy,” as she imagines, she winds up working in a Walmart, in a pathetically funny scene. She then takes a job in a “gentleman’s club,” where a veteran dancer teaches her the crucial difference between stripping and lap dancing (which is what they do). Yet, Anna is not enticing the moneyed clientele because, as she comes to realize, her breasts are too small. Hence, during a dizzying scene, “Anna Nicole” offers what has to be the first depiction in opera history of silicone implant surgery.        
The procedure does the trick. Anna attracts a twice-divorced oil billionaire, J. Howard Marshall II (who was 89 when he married the 26-year-old divorced Smith). The dynamic tenor Robert Brubaker has great fun in the role of the nasal-toned, dilapidated, still randy eccentric. The billionaire gives Anna everything, except the ranch she would like to live on with her boy, Daniel. To win over Marshall, Ms. Miller’s Anna (her back to the audience) performs oral sex on him, surrounded by a crowd of stunned reporters. Afterward, in another moment of poignant, quizzical music that takes you by surprise, Anna tells little Daniel, “We got the ranch.”        
Act II opens after the wedding of Anna and Marshall, and in a surreal staging touch we see the couple waking up on a humongous mattress, watched by the first of what will be many prying demons: dancers in black tights with television cameras for heads. The opera closely follows the tragic final decade of Smith’s life. (She died in 2007 at 39.)        
Marshall dies; his children from an earlier marriage go to court to keep Anna from inheriting anything; she gains weight and grows reliant on the creepy Howard K. Stern, who is her lawyer, manager, adviser and lover — here the baritone Rod Gilfry, who conveys the character’s swagger and scheming.        
In the last scene, Daniel is now a drug-addled teenager (Nicholas Barasch) who brings his mother “pills and pillows” to cushion the constant pain in her lower back, a result of the implants. Daniel dies while visiting his mother, from a fatal combination of pills. The only lines Daniel sings, in elusive, hazy music, come after his death, when he lifts his head from a body bag and goes through the litany of the drugs he has taken. Soon, from another body bag, the devastated, pill-popping Anna sings the opera’s hushed final lines.        
Mr. Steel and the academy showed courage in bringing “Anna Nicole” to New York. Even while trying to find a way out of a grim financial crisis, New York City Opera is again presenting a production that should not be missed.        



 
“Anna Nicole” continues through Sept. 28 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene; (718) 636-4100, nycopera.com.

This isn’t a case of Nimby, the neighbors in Sunnyside Gardens, Queens, say. It’s more a matter of namby.        


No aluminum in my backyard.        
Some residents are upset about a plan to build a two-story, eight-unit apartment house at 39th Avenue and 50th Street, in the Sunnyside Gardens Historic District.        
What has galvanized opposition is a gesture that was supposed to make the project palatable: In the crook of the L-shape apartment house, the architects Frances Campani and Michael Schwarting would reconstruct the vestiges of the groundbreaking prefabricated, all-aluminum Aluminaire House of 1931.        
“How can a house that in some ways resembles a spaceship be plopped down in the middle of this neighborhood?” asked City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, who represents Sunnyside Gardens.        
The proposal is scheduled to go before the Landmarks Preservation Commission on Tuesday.        
The Aluminaire House was first exhibited in the Grand Central Palace hall, which once stood near Grand Central Terminal, as a life-size example of how industrial materials could be used to build attractive, affordable homes. One architect interviewed by The New York Times said, “The light, rectilinear effect of this house suggests the simple elegance of line of Japanese houses.”        
The eminent architect Wallace K. Harrison bought the house — 22 feet and 6 inches by 28 feet and 8 inches — and moved it to Huntington, N.Y., where he altered and expanded it. Six years after Mr. Harrison’s death in 1981, a new owner planned to demolish the house.        
Paul Goldberger, then the architecture critic of The Times, sounded an alarm on March 8, 1987, saying that nothing less was at stake than one of “the pivotal works of modern architecture in America.”        
In the end, the new owner of the house donated it to the New York Institute of Technology. Mr. Schwarting, a professor of architecture at the institute, enlisted his students to help document and disassemble the building in 1988. The structure was later rebuilt at the school’s Central Islip campus.        
Last year, however, no longer being used for academic programs and under attack by vandals, the house was taken down. It is now in storage.        
The institute has given the building to the nonprofit Aluminaire House Foundation, founded by Ms. Campani and Mr. Schwarting, wife and husband, who are partners in Campani & Schwarting Architects of Port Jefferson, N.Y.        
Their search for a new home for the Aluminaire House brought them to Harry Otterman. In 2007, Mr. Otterman bought a lot at 39th Avenue and 50th Street that originally was a playground for youngsters who lived in Phipps Garden Apartments, across the avenue. The playground was designed by Marjorie Sewell Cautley and still has features like a sandbox pavilion and a wading pool basin, even though it has been closed for many years.        
Mr. Otterman seeks to develop the site with new housing. Because the lot is in a historic district, his plans must first be approved by the landmarks commission. Adding the Aluminaire House to the site was meant as an enticement to the commissioners.        
Mr. Schwarting acknowledged the difference between a metal-clad house and the understated redbrick garden apartments and row houses of the district. But he sees the Aluminaire House as complementary to Sunnyside Gardens.        
He said its architects, Albert Frey and Lawrence Kocher, had a lot in common with Clarence Stein and Henry Wright, who created Sunnyside Gardens in the 1920s. No matter how different the results, they all cared about finding ways to build welcoming, innovative and economical housing for working people.        
“We feel pretty sure that once it’s there, because it’s an intimate little piece, that it will function in the neighborhood as a landmark,” Mr. Schwarting said. The foundation would run the house as a museum.        
Most neighbors seem unwilling to give the plan a chance. They object to the incongruity of the Aluminaire House; the design of the new apartment building, which would be clad in terra-cotta panels; and the loss of an open corner lot. There is even a movement afoot, quixotic though it may be, to acquire the property and transform it into a public space called Cautley Garden.        
Herbert Reynolds, of the Sunnyside Gardens Preservation Alliance, framed the issue in terms of conservation. “We’re trying to respect the planned community that Clarence Stein and his colleagues entrusted to us,” he said, “and consistent, modest, handsome architecture, plus liberal open space with toddlers’ playgrounds, were very much part of that visionary plan.”        
The heads of two influential preservation groups, the Historic Districts Council and the New York Landmarks Conservancy, said they did not support the Aluminaire House plan. Still, almost everyone hopes it will have another life.        
“The Aluminaire House is architecturally significant,” Councilman Van Bramer said. “It should be restored and put on display for people to learn about, enjoy and experience. However, that should be done somewhere else.”

BookReview,"










BARNYARD BABYBy Elise BroachIllustrated by Cori Doerrfeld14 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $7.99. (Board book; ages 3 months to 3 years) 


As sweet as fresh apple cider, “Barnyard Baby,” by Elise Broach, with illustrations by Cori Doerrfeld, follows an irrepressible toddler though a day’s adventures on a farm. Broach’s text is impressionistic, with a fun-to-read-aloud sing-song rhythm. “Hayride baby / Feed the sheep / Leaf-pile baby / Run and leap,” she writes. The book’s spreads are autumn-hued, with many cheerful details: a brown puppy wears a jaunty yellow scarf à la Rupert Bear; tiny mice hold hands as they play on a hay bale; and when leaves fall to the ground, they form the outline of a heart. There’s much to look at and discuss, and lift-the-flaps give little hands something to do.        
KISS, KISS GOOD NIGHTBy Kenn NesbittIllustrated by Rebecca Elliott12 pp. Cartwheel Books/Scholastic. $8.99. (Picture book; ages 3 months to 3 years) 
Kittens, lambs, bear cubs, bunnies and chicks all snuggle their way to sleep with the help of their mothers in “Kiss, Kiss Good Night.” Kenn Nesbitt gives this big-format board book, with its shiny padded cover and dusky nighttime vignettes, a narrative in jaunty couplets: “When cuddly cubs begin to doze, / their mothers stroke them on the nose, / then grumble softy in their ear. / In Bear, that means ‘Good night, my dear.’” Tiny children will love the comforting sentiments, and older ones may find themselves memorizing the ingenious rhymes.        
GIGGLE Written and illustrated by Caroline Jayne Church 10 pp. Cartwheel Books/Scholastic. $7.99. (Board book; ages 3 months to 3 years) 
Parents and children are equally likely to enjoy Caroline Jayne Church’s adorable pictures of chubby-faced toddlers smiling, laughing and playing together in this very short book, and the text, only nine sentences long, is nicely written: “You may be small, / but you smile wide / when we play / side by side.” Opinions may differ, however, on the electronic button marked “Press here”: it emits a recording of giggling sounds that lasts about seven seconds. After a try or two, those seconds begin to feel — to an adult — a little long. Children, however, will probably want to press that button again and again. Caveat emptor.        
YOU ARE MY LITTLE PUMPKIN PIE By Amy E. Sklansky Illustrated by Talitha Shipman 16 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $6.99. (Board book; ages 3 months to 3 years) 
The cover of this delectable-looking book shows a bibbed baby tucking into what for many kids is the best treat on the Thanksgiving table. A pie tin shines with silvery corrugated paper, raised lettering glitters with pink sparkles, and Talitha Shipman’s palette of mango orange, bright purple and chocolate brown is good enough to eat. Inside, pumpkins hide in each seasonal scene of babies and their doting parents. On one page, they decorate a girl’s barrettes; on another they line a row-house stoop; children can have fun pointing them out. Those with a super-sweet tooth will find the text to their taste.        
ALPHABLOCK By Christopher Franceschelli Illustrated by Peskimo 104 pp. Abrams Appleseed. $16.95. (Board book; ages 1 to 4) 
Chunky dimensions make “Alphablock” easy for little hands to handle. From A to Z, each letter appears in a cut-out profile so kids can feel its shape. Though it is no surprise that “D is for dog,” Peskimo brings an element of humor to the familiar as a dachshund — whose elongated shape is already something of a punch line — is half hidden behind its signifying letter until the reader turns the page. While it’s graphically sophisticated enough to please adults, little children can happily flip through this book on their own.        
SPOT THE DOT By David A. Carter 14 pp. Ruckus Media Group/Scholastic. $12.99. (Novelty board book; ages 3 to 5) 
Hold the phone! A book based on an app? Brilliantly colored, each page presents a seek-and-find game in a different format. Some pages have pop-up elements, others have wheels and flaps that move to reveal shapes and colors in a tantalizing way. On repeated readings, children can use “Spot the Dot” like a memory game. Don’t let anti-app sentiment put you off; this book is a deviously clever piece of paper craft, perfectly suited to its medium.        
MUNCH! Written and illustrated by Matthew Van Fleet 14 pp. A Paula Wiseman Book/Simon & Schuster. $9.99. (Board book; ages 2 to 6) 
Matthew Van Fleet specializes in sturdy, bright books with pull tabs, textures and moving parts. In “Munch” (similar to its predecessors “Lick” and “Sniff”), animals of all sorts  —  with expressions ranging from grumpy to glad  —  homp, grind, swallow and gobble their way through their favorite foods. The book’s text does not trip off the tongue, but kids probably won’t notice; there’s fun enough to be had in making a beaver’s teeth judder across a log. Thick cardboard makes “Munch” more durable than some such books, though there’s nothing to stop human teethers from gnawing their way through it if they are so inspired.        
COLORS Written and illustrated by Xavier Deneux 20 pp. A Handprint Book/Chronicle Books. $14.99. (Board book; ages 3 and up) 
OPPOSITES Written and illustrated by Xavier Deneux 20 pp. A Handprint Book/Chronicle Books. $14.99. (Board book; ages 3 and up) 
These two thick volumes by Xavier Deneux, part of a series called TouchThinkLearn, make wonderful companions. The pages have a visual and tactile elegance that will appeal to eyes and hands. In “Colors,” one side of each spread has a raised cardboard picture — of a green leaf, in one case, on a white ground, while on the opposite side, the leaf shape is carved out of the page, leaving a white negative shape on a glossy green page.  Some pages correspond less directly: to demonstrate “blue,” a whale is faced by a submarine of a similar shape. In “Opposites,” Deneux uses the same style of page design to illustrate “caged” and “free” and more common pairings, like heavy and light, and white and black. The luxurious feel and minimalist style of these books could make them welcome gifts at the holidays.        
THE BOSS BABY Written and illustrated by Marla Frazee 36 pp. Simon & Schuster. $7.99. (Board book; ages 3 to 7) 
Not every board book is for babies. This one — originally published in 2010 as a picture book  —  seems best enjoyed by parents and their older children, who are ready to laugh (perhaps wearily) at the antics of one very bossy baby. He arrives wearing a suit-and-tie pajama ensemble, and he’s got an agenda that requires his parents’ constant attention. “He made demands. Many, many demands. And he was quite particular. If things weren’t done to his immediate satisfaction, he had a fit.” Marla Frazee (who illustrates the Clementine series and Mary Ann Hoberman’s “Seven Silly Eaters,” and is also a two-time Caldecott Honor winner) holds back on sentiment, for the most part, and maximizes the laughs. After an evening spent reading sweet bedtime books to sleepy children, “The Boss Baby” might be the tired parent’s perfect nightcap.

Bills, bills, bills. They always seem to be multiplying, and adding digital devices like smartphones and tablets to our lives only makes the pile bigger. Thankfully, those same smartphones and tablets can also help track and manage all of the bills in one place.        


On Apple mobile devices, a simple and useful bill payment reminder app is Bill Tracker. The app’s main interface lists your bills in the order they are due, showing the date, amount owed and other data. It is great for telling you at a glance what you need to pay, and its interface is clean and unfussy.        
Adding a new bill to the system is as easy as tapping on the “+” button, selecting an account description or creating a new one — like “utilities” — and tapping in the details, labeling it as “electricity” or “gas” and so on. Once you’ve entered this information, you can identify it as a recurring bill, add any notes that you may need to prompt your memory and then save the entry.        
The app has a calendar view, and you can also itemize bills and track spending by category. Due date reminders are easy to set and can be programmed to go off several times before a payment is due. When you make a payment on time, you can update the relevant entry and include information like a confirmation number.        
The process of entering bill data doesn’t eat up much of your time, thanks to the app’s clean design. A version of the app with ads is free. A $2 version removes the ads and lets you sync your data among multiple devices.        
A similar free app on Android is Bills Reminder from Handy Apps. It also has an unfussy design and simple controls so entering data isn’t too laborious. The app lists bills in the order they are due, annotated with the relevant payment details. Recurring bills have a blue icon, and bills with a special note have an orange icon. This feature makes it easy to spot important or one-off bills among more regular ones.        
BillMinder, a $2 iOS app, has many of the same features but its interface has more detailed graphics, including prettier lists and reports of paid bills. BillMinder works much as its rivals do, so it also requires a lot of typing from you, but you may prefer its snazzier look and the detailed way it reports on your past payments.        
A popular and fuller-featured bill payment reminder app is Manilla. It is free on both iOS and Android. The app feels a little like Bill Tracker thanks to its straightforward interfaces and graphics, but it has more powerful options.        
Where Manilla stands out from the crowd is in its ability to connect with many popular American companies and download bill information automatically. And it is easy to use. To start the process with your Verizon cellphone bill, for example, you just enter your login information for Verizon’s Web site. The app will download your bill data from the company — saving you the trouble of typing in a coming bill manually.        
To ease concerns about entering sensitive data into the app, which could be seen by someone who gets into your phone, the app is pass code protected.        
For such a nicely designed app, there are some curious weak points, like the limited options for customizing alerts and reminders in the way that even some of the simpler apps allow.        
The popular Check app from Pageonce is similar to Manilla, but it includes additional features, like the ability to keep track of your credit cards. While it still acts as a simple bill payment, reminder and organizer app, it can also let you pay bills through your bank account or credit cards.        
The app is well designed with a great-looking user interface, but it is complex. The app does the job of pulling all your bank and bill data into one place, but if you’re the type of person who likes to keep hands-on control over your finances and bills, it may not suit you. Check is free on iOS and Android.        
 Quick Call
 
Readdle has just overhauled its popular calendar app for iOS devices into a new version, Calendar 5. It now has iPad support and its graphics are in keeping with Apple’s new iOS 7 design. The app is powerful and an improvement over Apple’s stock Calendar. It’s available for $7.

                            Promoted as a hip stoner comedy, “Newlyweeds” sustains an amiable, jocular tone, even when its characters flirt with self-destruction. This portrait of a cannabis-using couple living in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn puts on the appearance of a happy-go-lucky romp. But under its nonchalance is a cautionary story about potentially wasted lives that feels as close to “The Panic in Needle Park” as it does to a Cheech and Chong movie.        


                            At the center of the film are Lyle (Amari Cheatom) and Nina (Trae Harris), an attractive, free-spirited couple whose lives increasingly revolve around their ravenous appetites for marijuana and hashish. You can’t really blame Lyle for seeking an escape. He has a miserable day job working as a repo man for Manny’s Rent-to-Own, a furniture and appliance outlet.        

                            Lyle and his co-worker Jackie (Tone Tank) spend much of each day in a van, stalking customers who are late with payments. In an early scene, they barge into the apartment of a man they observe shoplifting beer at a convenience store and forcibly repossess his stereo and sofa. Upon returning to the van, Lyle realizes that he misread the man’s address and insists that they return the items. But Jackie refuses; what’s done is done.        

                            It is the first of many misadventures partly caused by the characters’ altered states. (Lyle smokes on the job; Jackie is perpetually hung over from alcohol; and Nina’s sense of judgment is increasingly shaky.) As little disasters pile up, your sympathy for the characters wanes. At the same time, the relationship between Lyle and Nina, who works as a guide at the Brooklyn Children’s Museum, begins to unravel, and they squabble about drugs and money. Nina dreams of traveling with Lyle to the Galápagos Islands, but their savings have gone up in ganja smoke.        

                            “Newlyweeds,” the first feature directed by Shaka King, is a breezily paced, sharply observant portrait of a struggling, polyglot neighborhood whose poorer residents exhibit a feisty resilience as they do whatever is necessary to survive. Everyone is a Character with a capital C. With their pungent sense of a place and nonjudgmental attitude, the best scenes have the zany vitality of an early Spike Lee movie.        

                            But the story jumps from incident to incident with little connective tissue. It all too effectively observes the world from Lyle’s stoned perspective. So much smoke is exhaled in close-up that your vision seems blocked. The cleverest of several hallucinatory sequences is a parody of ’70s blaxploitation movies like “Shaft.” In another, Lyle’s stoned observation of Nina and her flirtatious co-worker Chico (Colman Domingo) blowing pot smoke into each other’s mouths incites paranoia.        

                            Nina’s downfall comes after some elementary school students who live next door unwittingly ingest hashish brownies stolen from her bag and freak out. Arrested and sentenced to do community service, Nina goes to live with her strict parents. Lyle’s undoing comes after he adds alcohol to his self-medication. He, too, lands briefly in jail.        

                            “Newlyweeds,” for all its freshness, never really lands. It remains suspended in a haze of secondhand smoke.        

“Newlyweeds” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The movie is bathed in pot smoke.

WASHINGTON — After three years of cajoling, finessing and occasionally strong-arming his fitful conservative majority, Speaker John A. Boehner waved the white flag on Wednesday, surrendering to demands from his right flank that he tie money to keep the government open after Sept. 30 to stripping President Obama’s health care law of any financing.        


Mr. Boehner knows that the plan he unveiled cannot pass the Senate, and that it may prove unwise politically and economically. His leadership team pressed just last week for an alternative. But with conservative forces uniting against him, he ultimately saw no alternative but to capitulate — and few good options to stop a government shutdown in two weeks.        
“Today was a step forward, and a win for the American people,” said Representative Tom Graves, the Georgia Republican whose “defund Obamacare” push had amassed 80 House supporters, a bloc large enough to dictate the outcome.        
With much of the government set to run out of money at the end of the month — and run out of borrowing authority by mid-October — Mr. Boehner faced a choice: he could steer a middle ground and find a way out of his fiscal dead end with Republican and Democratic votes, or he could yield to a conservative movement to strip the Affordable Care Act of financing, unite his Republican majority around that war cry, and hope for the best.        
House conservatives let Mr. Boehner know that any solution that could not attract a majority of the Republican conference could cost him his speakership. Divided Senate Republicans made clear that linking further government spending or a debt ceiling increase to gutting the health care law would never get through the Senate.        
In March, the speaker himself said: “Do you want to risk the full faith and credit of the U.S. government over Obamacare? That’s a very tough argument to make.”        
On Wednesday, the speaker announced his choice.        
“The law’s a train wreck,” he said. “It’s time to protect American families from this unworkable law.”        
The House’s stopgap spending measure would finance the government through Dec. 15 at the current spending levels, which reflect the automatic spending cuts that took effect in March, known as sequestration, while blocking the health care law, under which the uninsured will be enrolled beginning on Oct. 1.        
If the bill clears the House on Friday, Republican leaders could put forward a measure as soon as next week that would raise the government’s statutory borrowing limit. That bill would also take aim at the Affordable Care Act, with a one-year delay of its provisions coupled with a one-year increase in the debt ceiling. It would also expedite the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Louisiana and set a timeline for an overhaul of the federal tax code, and possibly include some other Republican wishes, like specific spending cuts and regulatory changes.        
For Mr. Boehner, the announcement Wednesday was a humbling moment, and possibly a defining one. Since the Tea Party wave swept Republicans to power in 2010, the beleaguered speaker has often found himself at odds with the most conservative wing of his conference. In late 2011, he famously put his fractious conference on mute as he explained via telephone how it had to give up its opposition to extending a cut in the payroll tax.        
Three times this year, on major pieces of legislation, the speaker has put what he believed to be the greater needs of his country and his national party over those of his recalcitrant right wing. In January, the House passed legislation to avert huge and sudden tax increases on virtually every American — but let taxes rise on the wealthy — with Democratic votes and a minority of votes by Republicans. The same math passed relief for Hurricane Sandy and a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.        
This time around he was contrite, quoting a plaque that graced the speaker’s office of Newt Gingrich: Listen, Learn, Help and Lead.        
“The key to any leadership job is to listen,” Mr. Boehner said.

The president of Sudan, wanted for years by the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide and other crimes in the Darfur conflict, set off a growing storm of anger on Wednesday with his plan to attend the United Nations General Assembly, as human rights advocates urged governments to oppose the visit and the court’s judges asked the United States to arrest him if he dares to come.        


American officials confirmed on Tuesday that the Sudanese leader, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, had submitted a visa request to attend the General Assembly, which runs through the end of the month. As the host country, the United States is obliged to grant visas to foreign heads of state or representatives who wish to attend the General Assembly, regardless of their reputations or any disputes the American government may have with them.        
Visas have historically been granted to world leaders who are widely despised or mistrusted in the United States, including Fidel Castro of Cuba, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, Hugo Chávez of Venezuela and Nikita S. Khrushchev of the Soviet Union.        
But Mr. Bashir’s case is different because he would be the first visitor to the United Nations with a standing warrant for his arrest by the International Criminal Court at The Hague. The court has accused him of criminal responsibility for atrocities, including genocide, committed in the western Darfur region of Sudan, where more than 200,000 people were killed and more than two million uprooted by almost a decade of fighting between the government and rebels.        
American officials, including Samantha Power, the new American ambassador to the United Nations, have denounced his plan to visit, but it is unclear what they can do legally to block it. The United States is not a member of the International Criminal Court and is not bound by provisions that require members to carry out arrest warrants on fugitive defendants.        
But the United States is a member of the Security Council, which voted to refer prosecutions for Darfur atrocities to the International Criminal Court, and the American government has supported the court’s efforts to hold Mr. Bashir and others to account. Ms. Power said Monday that instead of coming to the General Assembly, “it would be more appropriate for him to present himself to the I.C.C. and travel to The Hague.”        
Mr. Bashir has made no secret of his contempt for the International Criminal Court and has come to personify the problem of impunity that the court has increasingly confronted in prosecuting cases. But a visit by Mr. Bashir to the United Nations, which helped to create that court, would represent a new level of audacity.        
“I’m shocked by the fact that he’s even thinking about it,” said Jordan Paust, a professor of international law at the Law Center of the University of Houston. “He really does seem to be thumbing his nose at the U.N. and the Obama administration.”        
The Sudanese government, which as of Wednesday had not received a State Department response to Mr. Bashir’s visa request, castigated Ms. Power and other officials who said he should not come.        
“The president’s visit will be to the U.N. headquarters,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “The hosting nation — the United States — does not have the legal right to object to the participation of any official from a full member state in the international organization in U.N. activities.”        
The ministry added: “The government of the United States is not qualified morally, politically or legally to give advice on respecting international humanitarian law and human rights in light of its well-known track record of committing war crimes and genocide against entire populations, the last being its invasion of Iraq in 2003.”        
Alarmed at the prospect that the United States may have no choice but to grant Mr. Bashir a visa, Human Rights Watch issued an urgent call on Wednesday for the Security Council to publicly oppose his attendance.        
“If al-Bashir turns up at the U.N. General Assembly, it will be a brazen challenge to Security Council efforts to promote justice for crimes in Darfur,” said Elise Keppler, the associate director of the international justice program at Human Rights Watch. “The last thing the U.N. needs is a visit by an I.C.C. fugitive.”        
Later Wednesday, the court’s judges also took the extraordinary step of asking the Justice Department to take Mr. Bashir into custody if he proceeded with the visit on the legal theory that even countries that are not members of the court can decide to cooperate with it. In a statement, the judges said, “informed by the Office of the Prosecutor of Omar al-Bashir’s potential travel to the United States of America,” they had “invited the competent U.S. authorities to arrest Omar al-Bashir and surrender him to the court, in the event he enters their territory.”        
In March 2009, judges at the International Criminal Court ordered Mr. Bashir’s arrest, charging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity for playing an “essential role” in the murder, rape, torture, pillage and displacement of large numbers of civilians in Darfur. In 2010, the court issued a second arrest warrant for Mr. Bashir, this time on three counts of genocide.        
While he has taken some international trips since then, Mr. Bashir has been forced to skip other events abroad because of the charges.        
In July, Mr. Bashir made a brief appearance at an African Union summit meeting in Nigeria but departed after human rights groups filed a lawsuit calling for his immediate detention on an international arrest warrant.

In the most significant sign yet of a broad shift in the focus of Alzheimer’s research from treating to preventing the disease, the federal government announced on Wednesday its largest grant so far to test an Alzheimer’s drug on healthy people at greatest risk for the most common form of the disease.        


The $33.2 million grant, and several other prevention studies awarded federal money in the last year, follow years of unsuccessful trials of treatments on people who already have dementia. Those failures have led to the realization that these drugs appear to be ineffective by the time memory and thinking problems have taken hold. At the same time, scientific advances have allowed researchers to identify people at risk for Alzheimer’s long before symptoms emerge.        
With five million Americans suffering from Alzheimer’s and their ranks projected to surge as baby boomers age, federal health officials consider the disease such a priority that Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, scraped money together when forced budget cuts slashed the Obama administration’s promise of $100 million in additional funding for Alzheimer’s for 2013. Dr. Collins said he dipped into the budgets of the 27 N.I.H. agencies to supply $40 million awarded Wednesday for several Alzheimer’s research projects. Another $5 million was provided by the National Institute on Aging.        
“The worst thing we could do would be to just hunker down and hold off tackling very important problems,” Dr. Collins said, adding, “Obviously, this is high-risk research, but goodness, the stakes are so high that we felt we had to go forward even in the face of the most difficult budget environment that anyone can remember in the N.I.H.”        
The idea is to approach Alzheimer’s with a strategy similar to that used for heart disease and other conditions, said Laurie Ryan, program director for Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials at the National Institute on Aging, part of the N.I.H. “We’re going to look at people at risk, just like we do with people who have high cholesterol and are at risk for cardiovascular disease,” she said. “If we intervene now, can we prevent or at least delay the disease?”        
The $33.2 million grant, part of the government’s national Alzheimer’s plan, will help finance a clinical trial to test a treatment on people 60 to 75 who have no symptoms of the disease, but do have two copies of a gene known to greatly increase the risk of getting it as people age.        
The project, led by Dr. Eric M. Reiman and Dr. Pierre N. Tariot of the Banner Alzheimer’s Institute in Phoenix, will test a drug or placebo on 650 adults in several locations, mostly in the United States. All of the participants will have two copies of the gene, ApoE4, having inherited it from both parents.        
Studies have found that more than half the people with two ApoE4 genes will develop Alzheimer’s, compared with about one-fourth of people with one copy and 10 percent of people with no copies. People with two copies also develop symptoms earlier, around age 68, years before most people with one copy and more than a decade before most people without the gene.        
People with two ApoE4 genes make up only about 3 percent of the population, but because they develop the conventional late-onset form of Alzheimer’s, they are important to study. About 25 percent of people possess one copy of the gene.        
The Banner project has not yet chosen the drug to be tested, but it will be a treatment that attacks amyloid, a protein that accumulates in plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.        
Expected to begin in 2015, the project will ultimately cost more than $100 million, most of which is expected to be financed by the pharmaceutical industry, with some money from nonprofit sources, Dr. Reiman said. Researchers will use sophisticated tests to measure whether the drug helps delay memory or cognitive decline over five years, although Dr. Reiman said the tests may be able to record some results in as little as two years. The study will also measure brain and neurological changes over time.        
Jamie Tyrone, 53, a retired nurse in Ramona, Calif., said she felt traumatized when she learned while participating in a different research effort that she has two copies of ApoE4.        
“For the first time I feel hopeful,” she said. While too young to participate in the trial, she recently formed a nonprofit organization called Beating Alzheimer’s by Embracing Science (Babes), which will soon have its inaugural fund-raiser, featuring the celebrities Helen Reddy and Marilu Henner.        
She said the new trial “means so much to me because if this study has a positive outcome, guess what — I can be treated and I don’t have to live in fear anymore.”        
The new grant is the latest of several grants for Alzheimer’s prevention studies. In 2012, the N.I.H. awarded $16 million to a project led by the same researchers and Dr. Francisco Lopera, a Colombian neurologist. The researchers will test an anti-amyloid drug on members of a Colombian family, the largest extended family in the world with a gene mutation that causes them to develop Alzheimer’s early, showing cognitive impairment by around age 45. In that trial, expected to start this year, family members as young as 30 will receive the drug, Crenezumab, manufactured by Genentech, which is financing the largest portion of that $100 million trial.        
Earlier this year, the N.I.H. gave a significant grant to a study that, like the Banner trial, will focus on people at risk for common late-onset Alzheimer’s. Led by Dr. Reisa Sperling, who runs the Alzheimer’s program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, the trial will test the anti-amyloid drug solanezumab on 1,000 people in various locations who do not have symptoms of Alzheimer’s but do have amyloid plaques in their brains. The three-year trial will receive about $7 million in federal money its first year, and a possible total of $36 million.        
On Wednesday, the N.I.H. also awarded $1.5 million to a trial of three anti-amyloid drugs on people with rare gene mutations that lead to early-onset Alzheimer’s. The trial, run by the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network led by Dr. Randall Bateman of Washington University in St. Louis, may receive a total of $6 million over four years.        
Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Alzheimer’s center, who is not involved in these prevention trials, said the studies complemented each other and had the potential to answer questions about the role of amyloid as a potential cause of Alzheimer’s and whether attacking it can prevent dementia.        
“That doesn’t mean we abandon people who need treatment,” Dr. Petersen said. “But from a public health perspective, if you want to prevent millions of people from getting the disease, this is the way we have to go.”        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 18, 2013A headline with an earlier version of this article misstated the form of Alzheimer’s disease that the Alzheimer’s Prevention Initiative will focus on. It is late-onset Alzheimer’s, not early-onset.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — When Terry Francona spent last season away from the dugout, as an analyst for ESPN, he expected to gain perspective on life. He needed the break after eight seasons of exhilaration and exhaustion as manager of the Boston Red Sox, but his mind rarely strayed from the only life he has known.        


“I have no perspective,” Francona said Tuesday, smiling as he spit tobacco juice into a Gatorade cup in the visiting manager’s office. There is no place he would rather be than here, managing the Cleveland Indians in a pennant race.        
“He’s pretty simple as far as how he goes about his day: it’s baseball, baseball, baseball,” said the bullpen coach Kevin Cash, a former catcher for Francona’s Red Sox. “Whatever we’re doing, we’re talking about baseball. We can be playing cards or watching TV, but the conversation is always on this team.”        
By now, Cash knows that when the coaches and Francona agree to leave for the field at 11:30 a.m., Francona will text them a half-hour early, eager to get going. Francona is always comfortable at the ballpark, and usually bored away from it.        
Yet, as much as he loves the game, Francona’s bitter exit from the Red Sox made him wary of taking just any job. The team had folded down the stretch in 2011, undone largely by a toxic clubhouse and the breakdown of trust between the front office and the manager. He was sure it would not be like that in Cleveland.        
Francona had worked there in 2001, as a special assistant in baseball operations. He knew the team president, Mark Shapiro, and the general manager, Chris Antonetti. In time, perhaps, he could have built a strong relationship with another management team. With the Indians, it was already there.        
“I wanted to be in a place where I thought it would bring out the good in me,” Francona said. “So when I went in to interview with Chris, I knew. It’s funny, I hear people say, ‘Oh, he knew they were going to spend money or he wouldn’t have taken the job.’ I never asked.”        
The Indians did spend last winter, signing the free agents Michael Bourn and Nick Swisher. Both have had down years, by their standards, yet the Indians were a half-game out of a wild-card spot after Tuesday’s 5-3 victory over the Royals.        
The Indians, whose pitching has come on strong in the second half, play the lowly Astros, White Sox and Twins after this series. That gives them a strong chance to make the playoffs for the first time since 2007, when Francona’s Red Sox stopped them one win short of making the World Series.        
“We would not be where we are without Tito,” Antonetti said. “The impact he’s made on our organization — not just the major league team — has been profound.”        
Tito is the name of Francona’s father, an All-Star outfielder for the Indians in 1961, and the name baseball people use for Terry. The decision to manage the Indians had nothing to do with family history, Francona said, but it made for a touching moment.        
Francona did not decorate his office at Progressive Field when the Indians hired him last October. But when the team arrived there for its first home game in April, he found vintage family photos from Cleveland on the walls.        
“That’s the way this organization’s been,” Francona said. “It’s not family, but it’s about as close as you can get to that feeling. So I just want so bad to do the right thing.        
“I get a little careful when they say I’m changing the culture, or being responsible for that. I want to be a part of that, but it’s us doing it together. It’s a complete team effort, and that’s why it’s working.”        
Francona, 54, meshed well in Boston with Theo Epstein, a much younger general manager who did not play professionally. Antonetti, 38, fits the same description. He was an assistant in 2001, when Francona worked for the Indians, and immediately won Francona’s respect. Antonetti was the smartest person in the room, Francona said, but never condescending.        
After his introductory news conference in Cleveland last fall, Francona flew to Arizona with Antonetti, who has a home in Goodyear, where the Indians train. Francona stayed over and fit right in.        
“I feel so comfortable, I’m walking around his house in my underwear,” Francona said. “There’s just no barriers. I can tell him anything — and I have — and I know that when he leaves my office, he’s got my back.”

Three years ago, one of the debates that preoccupied a certain stripe of hip-hop obsessive was the one over hashtag rap. That style, now a relic, referred to the phenomenon of rappers concluding a series of lines each with a single word — as if it were a hashtag — that served as an implied wink. Drake was maybe its highest-profile proponent, but Big Sean was generally credited with injecting the style into hip-hop’s DNA.        


That was probably the last moment in which Big Sean could take credit for beating Drake somewhere — the tables have inexorably turned. Listen to “Beware,” the biggest single thus far from Big Sean’s new album, “Hall of Fame” (G.O.O.D./Def Jam), a microscopically detailed look at a failing relationship. It’s an incontrovertibly Drake-like song, as is “Ashley,” another album highlight. For Big Sean, a Kanye West B-teamer, the only way forward, it seems, is to sound like Drake.        
Drake, in his own way, saw this coming. “Every song sound like Drake featuring Drake,” he rapped on “5AM in Toronto” earlier this year, and while it was rapped in anger, you sense that Drake enjoys seeing how indelible his mark has become.        
Call it Drakewave: the movement of artists who are adjusting their sound to better fit in Drake’s footprint, and the new artists who are arriving that way fully formed. They’re slowly remaking the genre — two, actually: hip-hop and R&B — in his image.        
The Drake template is clear: a mélange of singing and rapping; a subdued, moody musical atmosphere; a fluency in feeling. The success of the Weeknd would be unthinkable without Drake. Future’s evolution into hip-hop’s on-call emoter is similarly a post-Drake phenomenon. Drake is touring this fall with Future and Miguel in what will make for the year’s best de facto R&B lineup; it would be second best had Frank Ocean not gotten sick and canceled his appearance on a bill with James Blake at Drake’s OVO Fest last month.        
And then there’s OVO Sound, the Warner Brothers-distributed label led by Drake and his team that so far has two signees: the singer Partynextdoor, who’s like a burlier, less emotionally icy version of the Weeknd; and Majid Jordan, the dubby-disco duo that features on Drake’s single “Hold On, We’re Going Home.”        
Drake’s presence is felt in hip-hop as well. Whether through guest verses on songs or by inviting them to open for him on tour, Drake has had a hand in the ascent of nearly every relevant rising rapper of the last two years — Meek Mill, Kendrick Lamar, ASAP Rocky, 2 Chainz.        
In the case of Kyle, there’s no direct connection to Drake, but the borrowed DNA is clear. “Beautiful Loser” (Indie-Pop/Super Duper), Kyle’s whimsical and loose debut album, is equal parts mope and boast, all delivered with a softness that feels very familiar. Kyle’s extremely aware of the shadow he’s dodging: on “Keep It Real,” he raps, “They say I sound like Drake, I don’t.” But Kyle, who both raps and sings, doth protest too much. After all, last Sunday night, when the Drake album leaked online, he took to his Twitter account to tweet lyrics from it, just like all the other fans.

BEIJING — Debt trailed Governor Rick Snyder to China last week, where he tried to entice cash-rich Chinese to invest in his state, Michigan, and its tarnished jewel, the bankrupt city of Detroit.        


But here’s the odd thing — it wasn’t just the $18 billion Detroit owes that was on everyone’s lips, or the financial restructuring under way, which seemed to impress and provided the focus of much local coverage of the visit.        
Instead, Chinese reporters wanted the governor’s advice on how China should handle its own municipal debt, the scale of which is unknown but may be large — perhaps unmanageably large in some areas. Earlier this year, a former finance minister, Xiang Huaicheng, said local government debt might total as much as 20 trillion renminbi, or about $3.3 trillion, according to Reuters.        
“To prevent the emergence of ‘reproduction Detroits”’ in China, audit teams from Beijing have fanned out across the country in recent weeks to check the books of local governments and state-run companies, several Chinese news outlets quoted the Communist Party-friendly, Hong Kong-based Ta Kung Pao newspaper as saying. Ta Kung Pao called it “the biggest and most effective debt audit in Chinese history.”        
Mr. Snyder, an accountant by training whose Twitter username is @onetoughnerd, was diplomatic about giving advice when answering the first question from a Chinese reporter at a media event at the China Club in Beijing.        
“I am proud to say I am the token accountant governor in the United States,” he said. His translator looked puzzled.        
“Yeah. The only one,” he added, helpfully. “I may not be very exciting, but we balance our books and pay our debt.” Point made.        
Over all, “With respect to Chinese municipalities, what I would say is, I wouldn’t want to speak about them specifically because one thing is, there’s many ways to deal with debt questions,” he said. “Detroit is relatively unique in terms of having a huge debt burden.        
“I would say that Chinese municipalities might find it interesting to watch how we handle things in Detroit because we are putting in place a number of best practices to help better manage long-term debt as we emerge from the restructuring,” he said.        
Earlier, in an interview with American reporters, Mr. Snyder had been a little more specific. (“Being an old accountant, I could probably put you to sleep,” he said.) A key problem is that local governments frequently build budgets upon inaccurate revenue forecasting, he said.        
“So what they’ll do quite often is they’ll go through a political process to come up with what their revenue estimate is,” then discover it was an unreal assessment, he said. That is “the single most likely area where a municipality will blow it, on a consistent basis.”        
As any good business manager knows, a way to get out of debt is to increase revenue. And the governor was here not to dispense advice to China but to sell Michigan, and Detroit.        
His pitch covered trade and tourism, and it hit the spot in cultural terms. Chinese value fresh food: Want to fish in one of Michigan’s thousands of lakes, then eat your morning catch for lunch? Play golf, or buy a waiting-list-only, Michigan-made wristwatch? Import blueberries, an increasingly popular food here? How about a bigger slice of the global automotive business, summed up by the legendary persona of “Hengli Fute,” or Henry Ford, a household name here. The state of Michigan and Detroit have an awful lot to offer, was the carefully calibrated message.        
“One of the things I think is really important is to recognize the comeback of Detroit is already under way,” he told the American reporters. Jobs are being created and buildings bought, and there is even a squeeze on downtown and midtown housing, he said.        
But there is also land for sale — more than 30 square miles, or about 80 square kilometers. That might be something real-estate-focused China would be interested in, but the governor seemed careful not to appear too needy. He pushed back on the suggestion that Detroit was a “distressed asset.”        
“It’s the value place to go,” he said. “Not the distressed asset one; I wouldn’t use the word distressed. It’s really a value opportunity.”        
“Detroit is going to come back in any case,” he said. “What I would say is, I think Chinese investment could be an important influence and accelerator to the comeback. But again, it is not a central piece of it, but it could be a very helpful and useful piece that could be mutually beneficial.”        
It was Mr. Snyder’s third trip to China in three years, taking in Chongqing and Shanghai, too, and he had brought Michigan businesspeople with him. There was also a foray to Japan — over a week, in all.        
It was billed mostly as a relationship-building exercise, but there is already evidence of real Chinese investment. In December, Chongqing Helicopter Investment Company bought Enstrom Helicopter Corporation, in the city of Menominee. In May, work began on an expansion expected to nearly double the size of its facility, adding 150 to 200 new jobs, according to statements on the company Web site.        
But the tough edge of China’s development strategy — long focused on acquiring technology from developed countries by any method necessary, whether legal, illegal or extralegal — was also on display during the governor’s visit.        
“You invited Chinese companies to invest in Detroit and Michigan,” a reporter for Global Times, a nationalistic newspaper owned by People’s Daily, the Communist Party flagship, said at the Chinese media event. “Do you think it is possible for the Chinese companies to get access to some key technologies in the U.S. companies, especially in the automobile sector?”        
Mr. Snyder didn’t directly answer that question, instead underlining that he would support Chinese companies in finding talent and building their customer and supplier relationships, “the most important things for long-term business success.”

Travel,"










Growing up, Joe Diaz, a founder of the travel magazine and Web site Afar, visited his father’s birthplace, Málaga, the Spanish port city along the Mediterranean, nearly every year. And yet conversations with his grandmother never progressed beyond, “Te quiero mucho, yaya.”        


In 2001, the summer before his senior year of college, Mr. Diaz decided to remedy that. Stopping into an STA Travel agency one evening, he walked out with a ticket to Barcelona and enrolled in an intensive Spanish program. At the end of his six weeks there, he returned to Málaga, this time with more to say to his grandparents and cousins.        
“It was the first time I was in Spain without my parents there translating everything,” he said. “I was able to reconnect with them and the city in a much deeper way.”        
Below are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Diaz about Málaga and its surrounding areas, a region he has come to know well on his own.         
Q. Málaga was founded by the Phoenicians, then conquered by the Romans, the Visigoths, the Moors. Where does one begin to understand the remarkable span of its history? 
A. Anywhere, really. Reminders of all the different hands it’s gone through are everywhere. The Roman theater, an amphitheater built by the Romans in the first century B.C., is right near the center. And above it, sitting on a hill, is Málaga’s Alcazaba, this imposing, palatial fortress built in the 11th century by the Moors. It’s pretty well preserved, one of the best alcazabas in Spain.        
But to really understand the city’s history, go to the Picasso Museum. It’s in a 16th-century palace, and when they were refurbishing it, they found these structures in the cellar, and archaeologists confirmed they were remnants of the original city wall from Phoenician times. It’s really cool to go into this beautiful, relatively modern museum, see this amazing collection of art and descend into this other world. It brings out the richness and depth of that part of Spain.        
Any areas outside the city that you visit often?  
As you go west toward Torremolinos and Marbella, you’ve got these really incredible beaches. Or to the east, Rincón de la Victoria and Nerja, these sandy alcovey beaches. But I always go inland to Álora, where we still have family.        
What is Álora like? 
A typical Spanish town: whitewashed buildings, two, three, four stories, really narrow cobblestone streets. There’s a hill overlooking the town, El Hacho, with a big cross at the top. From it, you see the entire town in the valley below, the Guadalhorce River running through it, and the mountains in the distance.        
Any places to eat? 
There are so many that you just pop into. One is Jamonería Díaz — no relation — which is a 150- or 200-square-foot tapas bar with cured ham legs hanging from the ceiling. Order up a plate of jamón serrano, some Manchego, cold Cruzcampo beers, vino tintos and sit there right out on the street. You’re making me long for this now.        
Los Caballos — the Horses — sits next to a horse ranch in the valley, and that’s a cool, local restaurant where people go to have big lunches. It’s where we ended up at 9:45 in the morning after my cousin’s wedding, and everyone finished partying with a big breakfast and then went home to nap.        
You’ve traveled to dozens of countries for work. What’s different about returning to the same place year after year?  
That’s what travel, to me, is all about: establishing deep connections in places. When you do that, you find yourself being pulled back to those places.        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 29, 2013An answer in the Q&A column last Sunday about the travel magazine founder Joe Diaz and his frequent visits to Málaga, Spain, misidentified his father’s birthplace at one point. As the column correctly noted elsewhere, his father was born in Málaga — not in Alora, where he moved when he was 2.

One of the most prolific and honored filmmakers in television is moving from PBS to HBO.         
Susan Lacy, the creator and executive producer of “American Masters,” the celebrated public television series that has chronicled the lives and careers of scores of icons of American culture, has signed a multiyear deal to produce and direct documentary films for the pay cable channel.        
“It was not an easy decision to make,” Ms. Lacy said in a telephone interview. “But this was a wonderful opportunity for me to continue to make films.”        
When she created the “American Masters” show in 1986, Ms. Lacy was not even a filmmaker. She was the executive in charge of the series and hired different documentarians to create the show’s distinctive biographies of talents as disparate as Ella Fitzgerald and Edgar Allan Poe, George Balanchine and James Baldwin.        
But after supervising the series for more than a decade, and working in the edit room to produce the final products that won 26 Emmy Awards, Ms. Lacy began making films of her own. Among the subjects she has covered for “American Masters”: Rod Serling, Paul Simon, Judy Garland, Leonard Bernstein and Joni Mitchell.        
HBO has asked her to create a biographical series for its award-winning documentary division, headed by Sheila Nevins.        
Ms. Lacy said she was extremely proud of her work for PBS, though there is one aspect of the job she will not miss. Financing was often inadequate for “American Masters” projects and Ms. Lacy found herself “having to find money to supplement the funding for each film,” she said.        
Money will not be a problem at HBO, she acknowledged. “And I have to admit that was a big draw in taking this job,” she said.        
Among the Emmys that “American Masters” has won, the latest of nine for Outstanding Documentary or Non-Fiction series was for “Inventing David Geffen,” a film Ms. Lacy produced and directed.

Travel,"










Shortly after arriving at the new Viceroy Riviera Maya in Mexico, dogs are blessed by a shaman as he circles them with burning incense. Afterward, the dog receives a garland of shells and flowers and can retire to a miniature palapa.        


At the Essex Resort and Spa near Burlington, Vt., new canine theme weekends allow guests to spend the days hiking woodsy trails with their pets and learning how to bake. (Dog biscuits, that is.)        
One could go on, particularly in New York: the new pet pedometers at the Muse Hotel, the imminent pooch minibars at the Benjamin, the Lacoste polos for dogs coming soon to the Gansevoort hotels.        
As pets have evolved into family members — a trend market researchers refer to as “humanization” — it is hardly surprising that people want to take them along when they travel. And more and more hotels are happy to oblige. A higher percentage of properties than ever permit pets (61 percent, up from 52 percent in 2010), according to a 2012 survey by the American Hotel & Lodging Association. And the ones that do are ratcheting up their amenities to befit pet owners who long ago traded Kibbles ‘n Bits for gluten-free organic meals served with carob-peanut butter brownies, and au naturel paws for those finished off with nail polish.        
“We have definitely seen growth in pet-friendly hotels over the past several years, and currently more than 20,500 hotels on Travelocity’s site are listed as pet friendly,” said Courtney Scott, a senior editor at Travelocity.com.        
Dogs are the most common pet hotel guests, and hotels have courted their owners for years with gimmicks like doggy reiki and surfing. But increasingly such bells and whistles are just one part of more elaborate hotel pet programs meant to show travelers that dogs are not merely allowed — they are wanted.        
A decade ago hotels either “accepted” dogs or did not, said Len Kain, the editor of Dogfriendly.com, a travel site for dog owners. “You could not really say they welcomed them, that is, encouraged you to bring them.”        
Today, however, hotels are doing just that with packages that are both whimsical (“pet-icures” and pet psychics) and practical (pooper scoopers and pet sitting).        
At the Gansevoort hotels in New York, guests will soon be able to spare their pets from teeming sidewalks with a minimalist, Gansevoort-branded harness known as a puppy purse ($70), enabling the tiniest of dogs to be worn across one’s body like a living Judith Leiber bag. In North Carolina, the Ritz-Carlton, Charlotte — which is allowing dogs on a trial basis through December ($150 cleaning fee plus $50 a dog a night) — is providing Ritz-Carlton-branded doggy beds. And at the Muse in Manhattan, the chef is developing a room service menu for dogs. (Note to allergy sufferers: most hotels have designated pet rooms as well as deep-cleaning processes for rooms where pets have slept.)        
Guests staying with pets at the Muse, part of the Kimpton chain, receive an amenity bag, the size of which depends on whether you own a teacup Pomeranian or a Doberman pinscher, said Ericka Nelson, general manager. The bag, which guests get to keep, includes a water bowl; organic treats; a squeak toy; a pooper scooper; a leash; a special Do Not Disturb sign to let the staff know your pet is in the room; and The New York Paws, a guide to area parks, shops, pet sitters and animal hospitals.        
Kimpton, which does not charge for pets, also has daily complimentary wine hours (known as “yappy hour” at one of the brand’s hotels) at which dogs and owners mingle over cocktails as if they were a New Yorker cartoon.        
Perhaps this is the moment to note that the trend toward humanization means pet owners “are highly receptive to products similar to the ones they use for themselves,” according to a 2013 market research report by Packaged Facts. Is it any wonder then that some owners also wish their pets could talk? Bridget Pilloud, a pet psychic, said she regularly enabled owners to hear what their pets had to say last year at Hotel Monaco Portland, a Kimpton property in Oregon.        
“People have me ask questions to their dog, and I receive information,” said Ms. Pilloud, a former marketing executive who discovered that she had a way with animals several years ago after waking up in the night to find her dog talking to her. “I might see images. I might see things or smell things.”        
So what did guests ask? “Everything from ‘How’s my pet feeling?’ to ‘Are they happy here at the hotel?” said Ms. Pilloud of Petsaretalking.com.        
Such events can make for strange and delightful evenings. But do these marketing tactics really win new customers?        
“It’s gimmicky, but people have fun with it,” said Mike DeFrino, chief operating officer of Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group, who estimates that more than 100,000 pets stay in Kimpton’s 60 hotels each year, and that 99 percent of them are dogs. “It all goes over well in Portland.”        
But it’s not just dog owners who are being catered to. Even petless guests are invited to be pet owners for a night. At any Kimpton hotel guests can have a goldfish in a bowl delivered to their room, a service known as Guppy Love. “The more fun people have in our hotels,” Mr. DeFrino said, “the more likely they are to talk about us, the more likely they are to come back.”        
Take Kyle Fabitz, a lawyer from Austin, Tex., who travels weekly with Winnie, his 7-year-old silver Labrador.        
“I ultimately keep coming back here because I feel that my dog feels most comfortable being here,” said Mr. Fabitz, while staying at INK48, a Manhattan Kimpton hotel. “You can throw a ball up and down the hall if you want. She can bark.”        
Lesley Carey, vice president of the Orlando Hotel in Los Angeles, is seeing more business travelers like Mr. Fabitz bringing dogs along. “It used to be just on a leisure trip,” she said. (Last month the Orlando introduced a program that shuttles dogs between the hotel and Chateau Marmutt day care for $299, including the day care.)

As Andorra’s snowcapped peaks dissolved into waterfalls this summer, the warm mountain air filled with unfamiliar sights and sounds. Cirque du Soleil was in town in July and August, the latest effort by this tiny principality, sandwiched between France and Spain, to position itself as a year-round destination for vacationers.        


Andorra has never been synonymous with summer. The rugged landscape perched high in the Pyrenees has long conjured up images of a postcard-perfect winter wonderland. Untouched ski slopes offer solitude. Its bustling shopping centers are a magnet for die-hard shoppers who wander through endless stretches of clothing racks without ever encountering the high value-added taxes that are a fact of life around Europe.        
But increasingly, visitors are striding through the crisp mountain air in this Catalan-speaking nation of 85,000 even when there isn’t a snowflake in sight.        
“Our main objective is to convert Andorra into a 365-day destination,” said Montse Buíl, who heads public relations for Andorra Turisme, a government agency.        
One of the biggest changes came last January, during the height of the ski season, with the opening of two major all-weather venues: 360 Extrem, Andorra’s first indoor skate park (360extrem.com) and Inuu, a new spa wing (inuu.com) within Caldea, one of Europe’s largest thermal baths and long a top attraction in Andorra.        
Skate parks are hardly new in Andorra, where skateboarding becomes a warm-weather equivalent of snowboarding, and outdoor public ramps entice locals to practice kicks and ollies at all hours. But in the cavernous warehouse that contains the skate park of 360 Extrem, enthusiasts can perfect their moves in the middle of both winter and summer storms.        
As Carlota Maestre, an owner of 360 Extrem, put it: “It’s a country where it’s raining or snowing during all months.”        
On weekday mornings, the football field-size center is reserved for professionals and visiting teams, attracting international stars like the competitive freestyle skiers McRae Williams of the United States and Richard Permin of France to multiple-sport facilities comparable to what might be found at an Olympic training center. On weekday afternoons and evenings and on weekends, a 20-euro ticket for adults ($26.75, at $1.28 to the euro) — 14 euros for children under 14 ($18) — grants 90 minutes of access to 360 Extrem’s offerings. Its claim to fame is a vertigo-inducing 45.9-foot indoor ramp the owners claim is the tallest in the world, which hurls daredevils in gravity-defying poses into a pit of snow-white foam cubes.        
Nonadrenaline enthusiasts can languish in the cavernous pools at Caldea, which opened 18 years ago. Even among locals, the labyrinthine network of jets and whirlpools is so popular that Caldea is the only attraction in Andorra that remains open until midnight, rain or shine.        
Its gleaming annex, Inuu, offers yet another option that is protected from the elements. Entry to an exclusive zone within the spa, which has a separate lagoon and gym, is 65 euros — with the most extensive, “Idylia” package, a selection of five treatments that can be scheduled over the course of three days, priced at 313 euros.        
These additions have come as the principality tries to make its economy more self-reliant by growing a local tech sector. One project, unveiled in August, is the Active Tourism Andorra app, which lists various attractions around the nation, a mobile version of a guidebook. Within a few months, Andorran officials plan to introduce start-up conferences and a tourist-friendly system that promotes the rental of electric cars.        
For now, though, changing the way visitors view tourism in Andorra is the main focus. It was last fall that Andorra decided to assemble a circus out of its perennially thin air. It teamed up with Cirque du Soleil in a multimillion-dollar affair that officials hope will become an annual event. Cirque du Soleil descended on the capital, Andorra la Vella, for three weeks of performances of an original outdoor showcase called “Scalada.” The Andorran government commissioned the show and covered all production costs. Fittingly, the plot revolves around Andorra’s four seasons.

Foreign,"










WASHINGTON — Senior House Republicans on Wednesday accused the State Department of failing to hold senior department officials accountable for security failures that contributed to the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, last year in which four Americans were killed.        


“No State Department personnel have been fired or even disciplined,” said Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California who leads the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “No one has missed a paycheck.”        
Mr. Royce’s comments opened the first of three hearings this week that the House Republican leadership has scheduled as part of its scrutiny of the administration’s conduct before, during and after the attacks on the mission and on a nearby C.I.A. annex on Sept. 11, 2012.        
Republicans have accused the administration of ignoring requests from American diplomats in Libya for additional security in the months before the attack and of failing to launch a military response to blunt the attacks once they were under way. They also say the administration has placed blame on midlevel officials for mistakes they say may have extended all the way to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time.        
The Obama administration and its Democratic allies on Capitol Hill have rejected these criticisms, arguing that the State Department has moved swiftly to carry out 29 recommendations made by an independent review panel in December to improve security and training. They have accused Republicans of politicizing the attack for partisan gains.        
At Wednesday’s hearing, Mr. Royce and other Republicans took direct aim at Patrick F. Kennedy, the under secretary for management, whose office oversees diplomatic security, for what they said was a lack of accountability at the department for the failures Benghazi revealed.        
Mr. Kennedy responded that the four midlevel State Department officials removed from their posts and placed on administrative leave last December have been reassigned to jobs in which they no longer have “worldwide decision-making authority for security.”        
“To me that is serious accountability,” Mr. Kennedy said.        
“Reassignment just doesn’t cut it,” Mr. Royce said.        
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican, added, “State continues to merely shuffle the deck chairs.”        
More broadly, Mr. Kennedy said that despite improvements made by the department in the past several months — including additional Marine Corps security guards and diplomatic security personnel — diplomacy abroad was an inherently dangerous job.        
“We will do everything we can to deter and mitigate the effectiveness of any attack,” he said, “but we will not, even with willing and capable governments as our partners, stop terrorists or extremists from mounting attacks against us in all cases.”        
The independent inquiry into the attack against the Benghazi Mission — conducted by a panel called the Accountability Review Board that was led by Thomas R. Pickering, a retired senior diplomat — blamed the State Department’s diplomatic security bureau and another department office for failing to coordinate and plan adequate security. The inquiry also found that several diplomatic security officials showed poor leadership.        
As a result of the board’s recommendations, the State Department by later this fall plans to have dozens of additional diplomatic security agents at high-threat embassies and millions of dollars worth of advanced fire-survival gear and surveillance cameras in those diplomatic posts. It also plans to improve training for employees headed to the riskiest missions.        
But diplomats and lawmakers have warned it will take years and billions more dollars to fully carry out the changes called for by Mr. Pickering’s panel.        
The State Department late last year appointed for the first time a senior official — a deputy assistant secretary of state — to ensure that embassies and consulates in dangerous places get sufficient attention.        
But a separate review panel, led by Mark Sullivan, a former Secret Service director, concluded this month that with American embassies and consulates facing an increasing threat of terrorist attacks, the diplomatic security office is mired in the department’s sprawling bureaucracy and must be elevated in importance. Mr. Sullivan’s panel recommended creating a new under secretary job to oversee diplomatic security, a proposal Mr. Kennedy said was under review.        
Mr. Royce also raised concerns that a year after the attacks in Benghazi, “not one terrorist perpetrator has been captured or killed, despite the president saying that this was his highest priority.”        
The Justice Department has indicted suspects in the attack. American intelligence officials have a general idea of where they are hiding, but they have not been captured. Some military and law enforcement officials have grown frustrated with what they believe is the White House’s unwillingness to pressure the Libyan government to make the arrests or allow American forces to do so, current and former senior government officials say.        
On Thursday, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hear testimony from Mr. Pickering and another panel member, Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as from Mr. Sullivan.        
A House Armed Services Committee panel will also meet Thursday to examine the military’s preparedness to respond to attacks like the one in Benghazi. The same day, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing on the nomination of Gregory B. Starr to be the assistant secretary for diplomatic security.

After weeks of vociferous objections by faculty members, Pennsylvania State University said on Wednesday it was suspending part of a new employee wellness program that some professors had criticized as coercive and financially punitive.        


In particular, the university said it was suspending a $100 monthly noncompliance fee that was to be levied on employees who declined to fill out an online questionnaire. The form, administered by WebMD Health Services, a health management company, asked employees for intimate details about their jobs, marital situation and finances. It also asked female employees whether they planned to become pregnant over the next year.        
Last week, in an emotionally charged faculty senate meeting held on the main campus, several female professors told administrators that requiring women to answer such questions — or pay a fine — amounted to an invasion of their privacy.        
In a statement on Wednesday, Rodney A. Erickson, the president of Penn State, said that the university had heeded faculty concerns about the perceived invasiveness of the questionnaire and the punitive nature of the fine. “We have decided to suspend the $100-per-month surcharge so that people who are uncomfortable with any aspect of the survey will not feel as if they are being penalized,” Mr. Erickson said in the statement.        
Many employers use financial incentives to encourage employees to participate in workplace wellness programs, a trend that is likely to widen with the new health care law. Under the wellness rules for the Affordable Care Act that take effect next January, companies can offer a reward of up to 30 percent of health costs for employees who complete a participatory program like a risk assessment, or biometric tests like waist measurement.        
But the uproar at Penn State illustrates the pitfalls employers can face in imposing incentive-based wellness programs without first obtaining employee support. On a larger level, it suggests that employers’ increasing efforts to cut their health care costs are on a collision course with employees’ boundaries about medical privacy.        
“The big picture here is that, with the Affordable Care Act, the amount of the incentive has grown significantly and employers are jumping into this,” said Michael O’Donnell, the director of the Health Management Research Center at the University of Michigan. “We are going to see stops and starts as people figure out how to do that.”        
Penn State adopted the wellness program, which currently applies to nonunion employees including professors and staff, at the recommendation of Highmark Health Services, a company that administers Penn State’s health care claims. That led some faculty members to criticize administrators for adopting a wellness program without seeking input on its design from outside experts. In its statement on Wednesday, the university said it would now form a joint task force with faculty members to seek expert advice on both the adoption of the wellness program and health benefits matters generally.        
Industry experts also said Penn State stumbled by using a stick rather than a carrot approach to motivate employees. Professors complained, for instance, that the $100 monthly fine seemed like a strong-arm tactic, considering that some employees earned less than $50,000 annually.        
The original plan came under heavy criticism last weekend on social media.        
“Wellness plans causing trouble,” Dr. Eric Topol, a prominent cardiologist, posted on his Twitter feed. “A better model desperately needed!”        
“I’d object to WebMD’s #wellness questionnaire, too,” Janice McCallum, a health data marketing strategist, posted on Twitter.        
Penn State instituted the wellness plan in an effort to slow double-digit annual growth in its health expenditures. The university is self-insured, which means that it directly covers the health costs of some 40,000 employees, spouses and dependents — at an estimated cost this fiscal year of $217 million.        
Penn State faculty members welcomed the university’s decision to suspend the noncompliance fee and to set up a task force to seek faculty input on possible alternatives.        
“By removing the penalty, at least temporarily, they have removed the sticking point that was the biggest concern for employees,” said Matthew C. Woessner, an associate professor of political science. “It gives us hope that whatever future program they undertake, it will be undertaken with due diligence and high ethical standards.”

A HISTORIC VICTORIAN MANSION IN WESTMOUNT, MONTREAL 


$3.1 million (3,250,000 Canadian dollars) 
This three-bedroom Victorian mansion perched halfway up Mount Royal has upper-floor views of the St. Lawrence River in Westmount, an affluent suburb of Montreal. The original 1.5-story red-brick home was built in 1847 by a Montreal merchant and his wife, a member of the Hurtubise family, one of the first farmers in the Westmount area. A spacious attic and summer kitchen were added over time, and in 1879, a Montreal banker bought the home and added the central tower and wraparound veranda that give it a distinctive Victorian appearance. The three-story home, with its multicolored slate-tiled roof, widow’s walk, casement windows with brass hardware, and ornate gingerbread trim has been recognized for its well-preserved historic architecture with Montreal’s Heritage Emeritus Award in 2005.        
Because of its historic status recognition, changes to the home’s exterior are very difficult to make, said Liza Kaufman, a broker with Sotheby’s International Realty Quebec, which has the listing.        
With the conversion of a nearby old well house into a two-bedroom guesthouse and the expansion of the summer kitchen into a two-bedroom town house, the property now consists of three dwellings on more than a third of an acre, much of it landscaped with gardens and a cedar hedge. The main home is surrounded by an original wrought-iron fence and has stained-glass panels around the front door bearing its historic name, Riverview. Interiors have been modified over time, but the owners have retained period features like the 12-inch sculptured baseboards, original doors with glass transoms, and a staircase with a diagonal newel post. The property has five parking spaces and plans for a double garage have been approved by the city of Westmount.        
This property is in the oldest section of Westmount, a city with a population of more than 20,000 residents. The most affluent suburb of Montreal, Westmount has excellent public and private schools, attractive parks and copious public services, such as a pool and sports arena. The home is near a primary shopping area along Sherbrooke Street called Victoria Village, and downtown Montreal is about a 10-minute drive by car or 30 minutes by public transportation. Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport is about 20 minutes away by car.        
MARKET OVERVIEW 
Montreal has seen the volume of home sales slip in the last year, because of slower economic and employment growth, and buyers have enjoyed more negotiating power in certain areas, according to a spring 2013 report from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Prices in the region aren’t anticipated to fall, but their growth has slowed, with the average resale price expected to grow by 1.4 percent in 2013, versus almost 4 percent the year before, according to the report.        
One of the areas where buyers have gained the upper hand is Westmount, where average prices have fallen by 7 percent in 2013, according to statistics provided by the Greater Montreal Real Estate Board. But the Westmount market is typically a solid one, and prices aren’t expected to fall much farther, said Diane Ménard, the board’s vice president.        
“Westmount has always been an area in demand — it’s a very high-end area,” she said. “There’s a slight decrease in prices, but I don’t see that they’re really going to fall down too far. The market is still good in Montreal.”        
While the average price of a detached home for resale in Montreal in 2012 was about 326,000 Canadian dollars ($311,000), in Westmount, the average single-family home was almost 1.5 million Canadian dollars ($1.4 million). Ms. Kaufman said the most expensive single-family home ever sold was about 7 million Canadian dollars ($6.7 million).        
“There are also semidetached homes that go up to 2 million Canadian dollars,” she said, or $1.9 million.        
WHO BUYS IN MONTREAL 
Only about 2 to 3 percent of home buyers in Westmount are from foreign countries, Ms. Menard said. The bulk are Canadian, and many of them are Westmount residents upgrading their homes, she said.        
The small percentage of foreign home buyers come from all over the world, particularly from France and China most recently, Ms. Kaufman said. She said she is also handling buyers from Dubai, Belgium and Japan. The strength of the Canadian dollar kept Americans away in recent years, but those buyers may be returning, Ms. Kaufman said.        
BUYING BASICS 
There are no restrictions on foreign ownership in Quebec, where notarial law much like that of France governs real estate sales. Notary fees typically cost about 1,000 to 2,500 Canadian dollars ($968 to $2,420), and home buyers also must pay a municipal transfer tax that equates to roughly 1.5 percent of the home’s sales price, Ms. Kaufman said.        
Mortgages are available for foreign home buyers, though banks may only finance 50 to 65 percent of the purchase. “Most of my foreign buyers tend to buy in cash,” Ms. Kaufman said.

TEHRAN — On the eve of a visit by Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, to the United States, the Iranian authorities on Wednesday unexpectedly freed 11 of Iran’s most prominent political prisoners, including Nasrin Sotoudeh, a human rights lawyer.        


Analysts said the prisoner release was a significant step in Mr. Rouhani’s efforts to repair Iran’s relationship with the West, mired in a dispute over Iran’s nuclear program and criticism of its human rights policies. His visit to New York to attend the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly is part of a diplomatic offensive he began after his election in June.        
Ms. Sotoudeh was serving six years in prison for endangering national security and misusing her profession as a lawyer. In a telephone interview after her release, she said: “I don’t know why they released me. I don’t know under what legal basis they released me. But I am free.”        
Her husband, Reza Khandan, said: “I just drove her home. My wife is freed.”        
Of the prisoners freed on Wednesday, eight are women and three are men. They include a journalist, Mahsa Amrabadi, whose husband and fellow journalist, Masoud Bastani, remains in prison. Some of them were taking part in Iran’s prison leave system, in which some prisoners are allowed to live at home but remain under the threat of imprisonment if they cross the authorities. But dozens of people remain in prison, especially those who have been sentenced for their roles in an antigovernment protest after the disputed 2009 election results.        
Mr. Rouhani is scheduled to speak next Tuesday before the General Assembly, where he is expected to portray an Iran ready to engage with the West.        
Analysts said the prisoner release could soften some of the criticisms over Iran’s human rights policies and allow for Mr. Rouhani to focus on finding a diplomatic solution to the standoff over Iran’s disputed nuclear program.        
“Clearly these releases are related to Mr. Rouhani’s trip to New York,” said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst close to the new president. “Iran wants to make a good impression on the eve of his trip.”        
The release of Ms. Sotoudeh, 50, is especially significant. For a long time, she was the only lawyer in Iran taking on high-profile cases, defending children, activists and minorities. Unlike some activists, Ms. Sotoudeh never chose to leave Iran, despite constant pressure on her by Iran’s intelligence services, which arrested her in 2010. In addition to her jail sentence, she had been banned from practicing law for 20 years; it was unclear Wednesday whether the ban had been lifted.        
In his annual message for Iranian New Year in 2011, President Obama specifically singled out Ms. Sotoudeh. “We have seen Nasrin Sotoudeh jailed for defending human rights,” he said.        
Iranian officials deny that there are any political prisoners in Iran, saying that all those behind bars have been tried according to the country’s laws.        
While in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, Ms. Sotoudeh went on two long hunger strikes after her 12-year-old daughter was denied permission to travel outside the country. In 2012, the European Union awarded her the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought.        
Among the other prisoners released on Wednesday was former Commerce Minister Feizollah Arabsorkhi, a member of a reformist political party declared illegal after the 2009 antigovernment protests, which were triggered by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s disputed re-election victory.        
Mr. Arabsorkhi was in a hospital in Tehran undergoing a shoulder operation when he heard that he had been officially freed, his wife, Maryam Sharbatqods, said over the phone. “Rouhani’s election victory has forced the authorities to release the political prisoners,” Ms. Sharbatqods said.        
Two presidential candidates in 2009 — former Prime Minister Mir Hussein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, a former Parliament speaker — have been under house arrest since 2011, along with Mr. Mousavi’s wife, Zahra Rahnavard. During his election campaign, Mr. Rouhani said he would work to secure their release.        
Mehdi, 27, a university student who took part in the 2009 protests and asked that his surname not be published, said: “Today’s prisoner releases show that there are negotiations going on regarding their freedom. Maybe it will take some time to get them freed from house arrest. I am much more hopeful now.”        
An imprisoned American of Iranian descent, Amir Hekmati, was not among those freed on Wednesday. Mr. Hekmati, 30, a former Marine, was arrested more than two years ago on espionage charges during what his family called an innocent visit to his grandmother. Mr. Hekmati’s family, who is from Flint, Mich., has been publicly pleading for his release, and American officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry, have been calling on Mr. Rouhani’s government to let Mr. Hekmati go home.        
On Tuesday, Mr. Hekmati’s congressman, Daniel T. Kildee, sent a letter to Samantha Power, the new American ambassador to the United Nations, urging her to press the issue when Mr. Rouhani visits for the General Assembly session next week.

Two years after Thomson Reuters announced an ambitious effort to reach out to news consumers directly through a program called Next, the company has decided to change direction and work through its Web site, Reuters.com.        


Reuters, a venerable news organization with a network of 2,000 journalists across the globe, has worked largely as a news wire service, with its reports and photos appearing in other publications. Next was to be a platform to reach readers directly, but it has been plagued by missed deadlines and cost overruns.        
In an e-mail to employees that went out this morning and appeared soon after on The New York Observer’s Web site, the chief executive of Reuters, Andrew Rashbass, said the causes of the decision were cost overruns and the failure to reach international consumers.        
“The project as a whole has struggled to meet delivery deadlines and stay within its budget,” he wrote. “Also, it does not capitalize on our strengths.”        
Mr. Rashbass, who was hired in May from the Economist Group, added: “Next is a long way from achieving either commercial viability or strategic success. In fact, I believe the existing suite of Reuters.com sites is a better starting point for where we need to go. Therefore I have decided to cancel the Next project and put our efforts into enhancing and improving the existing Reuters.com sites. We will repurpose as much of the Next development work as we can for that.”        
The e-mail said that several executives at the company had decided to leave as a result of the decision, including Jim Roberts, executive editor of Reuters Digital, who was hired at the beginning of the year after taking a buyout from The New York Times. Mr. Roberts was not immediately reachable for comment, though he posted to Twitter: “Yes, I’ll be leaving@Reuters, though not right away. & I’m not leaving news. Stay tuned.”        
In looking toward the future, Mr. Rashbass said: “We need to make our core strength of international news relevant to local audiences — which means, among other things, having local-language sites.”        
Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard, said he was surprised by Reuters’s decision because the preview version of Next had been generating such interest. “There were a lot of really exciting ideas in Reuters’s Next,” he said. “What we saw in the preview was very forward-looking in terms of both content and technology. It generated a fair amount of excitement as a news organization doing something that looked digitally savvy.”

In a break from tradition that has already rankled purists, the Man Booker Prize will be open to all novels originally written in English and published in Britain, the administrators of the prize announced on Wednesday. Previously, the prize had been open to novels written by authors from Britain, the other countries in the Commonwealth, and Ireland. The change is planned to begin in 2014.        
In a statement, the Booker Prize Foundation said that its members decided that the award, “which for over 40 years has been the touchstone for high quality literary fiction written in English, would enhance its prestige and reputation through expansion.”        
Jonathan Taylor, the chairman of the trustees, said in a statement, “'We are excited by the opportunities that extending the Man Booker Prize will bring for readers and writers worldwide. The expanded prize will recognize, celebrate and embrace authors writing in English, whether from Chicago, Sheffield or Shanghai.”

On its second night of jump-starting the new television season a week before its network competition, the Fox network again got some positive results.         
A new comedy, “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” got some promising ratings; another, “Dads,” fared well enough to hold out some hope, and one returned comedy, “New Girl,” showed some renewed strength.        
Only one comedy, “The Mindy Project,” generated disappointing numbers, probably disappointing as much to critics as to Fox executives because “Mindy” had been widely extolled before its second-season premiere. The premiere also featured a guest appearance by James Franco.        
Even so, Fox will probably take the overall performance on a Tuesday night, where it struggled badly last season. Probably the best news was the strong showing for “Brooklyn,” another favorite of critics, which drew six million viewers and a solid 2.5 rating among the group Fox sells to advertisers, viewers between the ages of 18 and 49.        
The other new series, “Dads,” which had been excoriated by critics for what they charged was racially insensitive humor, managed a 2.1 in that 18-49 group and 5.6 million viewers, both respectable numbers for a newcomer. “New Girl” returned with 5.6 million viewers and the best 18-49 rating of the night, a 2.9. Both numbers were up slightly from the show’s premiere episode a year ago.        
“The Mindy Project” however, showed what may be a worrisome falloff from “New Girl,” dropping to just under four million viewers and a 1.9 rating in the 18-49 group. Fox, which is also offering projections of how its shows will fare when delayed viewing is counted, offered some hope for “Mindy,” suggesting it could eventually reach more than six million viewers and climb to a 2.7 rating among those younger adult viewers.        
That would still be a sizable falloff from “New Girl,” which Fox thinks could get as high as more than 10.5 million viewers and perhaps a 4.7 rating in the 18-49 category.

WASHINGTON — Naval police in Rhode Island did not alert superiors in Washington to evidence pointing to the mental instability of the former Navy reservist who the police say killed 12 people at a Washington Navy base, Pentagon officials said.        


The police in Rhode Island who interviewed the man, Aaron Alexis, on Aug. 7 were concerned enough by his claims to be hearing voices sent by a “microwave machine” that they faxed their report to the naval police in Newport, where Mr. Alexis was working temporarily as a contractor. But the Newport police did not take further action because they did not consider Mr. Alexis dangerous.        
“He’s just hearing voices,” said Lt. William Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the department. “We can’t arrest someone for that.”        
The report was logged by security personnel at the naval station, but never made it into the hands of Pentagon officials who could have reassessed Mr. Alexis’s security clearance to enter the Washington Navy Yard, where the police say he opened fire on a crowd of civilians eating breakfast before police officers shot him to death on Monday.        
“In a big organization like the Navy it is never as connected as it should be, so you have reports and things that come into offices and never make it back to headquarters,” said a former senior federal official who has been briefed on the investigation.        
Mr. Alexis’s clearance, first obtained while he was in the reserves, has become the focus of intense debate in Washington over whether repeated signs of his problems, including insubordination in the Navy and arrests in three cities, were overlooked.        
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel acknowledged at a news conference on Wednesday that the process of granting security clearances needed fixing, saying that “a lot of red flags” about the gunman’s past behavior were missed.        
“Obviously, something went wrong,” Mr. Hagel said as he announced that he had ordered a sweeping review of procedures at Defense Department bases around the world. “We would hope we will find some answers to how can we do it better.”        
Among the questions will be whether more personal information — even short of information on a criminal conviction — should be required, and whether reviews of personnel for security clearances should be conducted more often.        
Two weeks after talking to the police about hearing voices, Mr. Alexis, 34, visited the emergency room at a veterans’ medical center in Providence, R.I., the Department of Veterans Affairs confirmed in a statement on Wednesday. But according to the department, he told a doctor only that he was having insomnia, and he was given a “small amount” of medication, which an official said was the antidepressant trazodone.        
He requested and received a refill five days later at a veterans’ medical center in Washington, saying he could not sleep because of his work schedule.        
When asked if he was having anxiety or depression, or was having thoughts of hurting himself or others, he answered no. “He was alert and oriented,” the statement said.        
While he was in Rhode Island, Mr. Alexis also told his employer that he was hearing voices through the walls of his hotel room and having trouble sleeping, a person with knowledge of the company said. Human resources officials at the company where Mr. Alexis worked, the Experts, believed Mr. Alexis was describing actual noise and moved him to two different hotels in Newport. They were concerned enough to contact the Newport police after Mr. Alexis said he had spoken to officers. But the police told the officials that they had no information about Mr. Alexis, the person with knowledge of the company said.        
In Brooklyn, Mr. Alexis’s mother, Cathleen Alexis, offered her first public statement since the shooting, expressing grief for the families of the victims.        
“I don’t know why he did what he did and I will never be able to ask him why,” she said. “Aaron is now in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone and for that I am glad. To the families of the victims: I am so so very sorry that this happened. My heart is broken.”

Marcel Reich-Ranicki, a survivor of the Warsaw ghetto who left Poland to become a powerful cultural figure in postwar Germany as a distinguished literary critic and a popular television talk show host, died on Wednesday in Frankfurt. He was 93.        


The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported the death but gave no further details. He had a long association with the newspaper, contributing reviews and columns as recently as last year.        
A Polish-born Jew who grew up in Berlin, Mr. Reich-Ranicki had a lifelong love for the German classics. He read the poetry of Goethe and Heinrich Heine even while enduring the cruelest months of Nazi terror, when he saw SS troops march his parents off to the Treblinka gas chambers.        
Over six decades he produced a stream of witty, sometimes barbed but consistently erudite commentary in a career that saw Germany through the cold war and national reunification. He became Germany’s leading literary arbiter, and in the process he helped pave the way for Jews to again play an important role in the nation’s culture and politics.        
He said he lived with the irony of loving the masterpieces, even of artists whose views he detested.        
“The biggest anti-Semite in the history of German culture was Richard Wagner,” Mr. Reich-Ranicki once told an interviewer. “And the greatest opera I know is his ‘Tristan and Isolde.’ ”        
The novelist Günter Grass once questioned Mr. Reich-Ranicki at a literary conference.        
“What are you really — a Pole, a German or what?” Mr. Grass asked.        
“I am half Polish, half German and wholly Jewish,” Mr. Reich-Ranicki replied.        
He later said that the statement was untrue, that he felt himself an outsider everywhere. It was a lifelong tension with his own identity that energized his work.        
Mr. Reich-Ranicki could be an irascible critic, fearless in defense of scathing judgments. Mr. Grass became a particular target. In 1995, four years before Mr. Grass won the Nobel Prize, a photograph of Mr. Reich-Ranicki appeared on the cover of the newsmagazine Der Spiegel showing him physically tearing apart Mr. Grass’s latest novel, “Too Far Afield,” which dealt with Germany’s moral struggle to reconcile itself with its terrible past. Asked at the time by a correspondent for The New York Times whether he understood that he had insulted Mr. Grass, Mr. Reich-Ranicki said, “Of course.”        
“He wrote a book that he considers to be the most important of his life, and he has to read in every newspaper that it’s junk,” Mr. Reich-Ranicki added.        
And in 2012 — six years after Mr. Grass stunned Europe when he revealed that he had been a member of the Waffen SS during World War II — Mr. Reich-Ranicki lashed out at Mr. Grass again, this time over a poem he had published, “What Must Be Said,” accusing Israel of being a threat to world peace. Mr. Reich-Ranicki called it “disgusting.”        
Mr. Reich-Ranicki was born Marcel Reich on June 2, 1920, in the industrial town of Wloclawek, Poland. When his father’s business failed in 1929, Mr. Reich-Ranicki was sent to live with relatives in Berlin, where he attended high school, became fluent in the language and grew enthralled by German literature and music. He read voraciously and attended the opera, even as conditions grew harsher for Jews in the 1930s.        
As a Jew he was not permitted to attend college; his sweeping grasp of German culture since the Enlightenment was a product of his own self-study. In 1938, the Nazis arrested and deported him to Warsaw, where he rejoined his parents and brother.        
In the ghetto, he saw German soldiers kill Jews on the street. Working as a translator, he was a witness to crucial meetings between the Jewish and Nazi authorities. In one instance he typed out the transcript of a July 1942 meeting as a Nazi SS officer, Hermann Höfle, ordered Jewish leaders to assemble thousands of Jews every day for “resettlement” to death camps. Recounting the episode later, Mr. Reich-Ranicki noted that Nazi troops waiting outside in the streets had set up a gramophone to amuse themselves with Viennese waltzes.        
Hearing that translators, and their wives, were exempt for the time being, Mr. Reich-Ranicki married his sweetheart, Teofila, that same day. (The marriage lasted seven decades; his wife died in 2011.) In September 1942, Mr. Reich-Ranicki watched his own parents board cattle trucks bound for Treblinka.        
“My father looked at me helplessly, while my mother was surprisingly calm,” he wrote. “I knew I was seeing them for the last time.”

MOSCOW — Russia sharply criticized the new United Nations report on Syria’s chemical arms use on Wednesday as biased and incomplete, hardening the Kremlin’s defense of the Syrian government even while pressing ahead with a plan to disarm its arsenal of the internationally banned weapons.        


The Russians also escalated their critiques of Western governments’ interpretations of the report, which offered the first independent confirmation of a large chemical weapons assault on Aug. 21 on the outskirts of Syria’s capital, Damascus, that asphyxiated hundreds of civilians.        
Although the report did not assign blame for that assault to either side in Syria’s civil war, analyses of some of the evidence it presented point directly at elite military forces loyal to Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. The United States, Britain, France and human rights and nonproliferation groups also say that the report’s detailed annexes on the types of weapons used, the large volume of poison gas they carried, and their trajectories lead to the conclusion that the forces of Mr. Assad were culpable.        
The Russian criticism came as the United Nations Security Council’s five permanent members began a second day of talks on a draft resolution aimed at ensuring that the Syrian government honors its commitment to identify and surrender all chemical munitions for destruction, steps it officially agreed to take under a deal negotiated Saturday by Russia and the United States that averted a punitive American missile strike on Syria.        
Russian news reports quoted the country’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, as saying during a visit to Damascus that Syria’s government had provided additional information that showed insurgents used chemical weapons not only on Aug. 21 but also on other occasions.        
The Syrians offered no such information to the United Nations chemical weapons inspectors before they left Syria with a trove of forensic samples on Aug. 31. The inspectors have said they will return to Syria to investigate other reported instances of chemical weapons use, but no dates have been announced.        
Mr. Ryabkov spoke after meeting with Mr. Assad and his foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem. He did not disclose the precise nature of the additional information the Syrians had conveyed to him, but he was blunt about his criticism of the report presented on Monday at the United Nations.        
“We are unhappy about this report,” Mr. Ryabkov said in remarks broadcast by the state television network, RT. “We think that the report was distorted. It was one-sided. The basis of information upon which it is built is insufficient.” He also said Russia needed “to learn and know more on what happened beyond and above that incident of Aug. 21.”        
Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, has also questioned the United Nations report, though not as harshly. Mr. Lavrov, who brokered the deal with Secretary of State John Kerry to put Syria’s chemical weapons under international supervision, said Tuesday that there were still “serious grounds to believe” that the Aug. 21 attack was a provocation carried out by the rebels.        
As he has many times, Mr. Assad, in an interview conducted Tuesday and broadcast Wednesday on Fox News, denied that his government was responsible for the attack. “We didn’t use any chemical weapons” outside Damascus, he said.        
Mr. Assad also said Syria would comply with the chemical weapons agreement, which he estimated would cost $1 billion and take about a year.        
Asked about the Russian criticisms, Martin Nesirky, a spokesman for Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, said it had been clear to everyone that the chemical weapons inspectors were focusing first on the Aug. 21 attack because of its magnitude and were planning to return to Syria to investigate other accusations, with a more comprehensive report to follow.        
Mr. Nesirky also took issue with the Russian portrayal of the report as biased. “The findings in that report are indisputable,” he said at a midday briefing. “This was a thoroughly objective report on that specific incident.”        
Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius of France, who had just visited with Mr. Lavrov, reacted angrily to the Russian accusations, saying they had surprised him. “Nobody can question the objectivity of the people appointed by the U.N.,” Mr. Fabius was quoted by Agence France-Presse.        
Russia, which like the other permanent Security Council members has veto power, is resisting coercive language in the draft offered by the Western members that could lead to military intervention in Syria. The Russian position appeared intended to sow enough doubt to call into question additional pressure on Syria’s government, and perhaps to cloud evidence that at least some of the country’s arsenal was of Soviet origin.

The family of the gunman.        


It is a sadly familiar fraternity bound by tragedy and, this week, relatives of Aaron Alexis joined the ranks of those left shocked, saddened and searching for answers to how someone so close could do something so unthinkable.        
“Our son, Aaron Alexis, has murdered 12 people and wounded several others,” said the gunman’s mother, Cathleen Alexis, in her first statement since Monday’s deadly rampage at the Washington Navy Yard.        
“His actions have had a profound and everlasting effect on the families of the victims,” she said. “I don’t know why he did what he did and I will never be able to ask him why. Aaron is now in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone and for that I am glad. To the families of the victims: I am so so very sorry that this happened. My heart is broken.”        
She did not comment on reports about her son’s mental health. In the weeks before he went on the shooting rampage, Mr. Alexis complained to the police that he was being followed and kept awake by people sending vibrations through the wall.        
A former Navy reservist, Mr. Alexis sought treatment from the Department of Veterans Affairs for insomnia twice in August, but no evidence has surfaced that Mr. Alexis was ever determined to be mentally ill or committed to a hospital. The Navy never declared him mentally unfit.        
His mother, suddenly at the center of the maelstrom, was barely able to get through the reading of a simple statement, much less talk about her son’s life.        
Wearing a black sweater, black pants, black slippers and her hair pulled back in a knot, Ms. Alexis read the statement from her small, sparsely decorated living room in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.        
Bishop Gerald G. Seabrooks, of the Rehoboth Cathedral in Brooklyn, stood by her side, helping to steady her as she struggled to get out the words.        
“She’s very sad, she’s grieving, she’s heartbroken,” he said afterward. “She’s really concerned about the victims.”        
The news is just too terrible to process, friends said.        
Ms. Alexis was at her job on Monday, working as a nurse in New York City, when the shooting was first reported, according to Ryan Stoner, a family friend and neighbor.        
When a suspect was identified, her co-workers noted that he shared her last name, but she continued go about her job. After all, there must be many families named Alexis.        
But then a picture flashed on her screen — her son was the one the authorities believed was responsible for the carnage she had been hearing about all day.        
She rushed home, and soon agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation were at her door. They arrived in the early afternoon and did not leave until close to midnight.        
Mr. Alexis’ two sisters, Tamara and Naomi, live with their mother and, soon after the agents left, the two went to talk to Mr. Stoner.        
While the agents circled over the same questions, the sisters said they had little contact with their brother in recent years and could not offer much help.        
None of it seems real.        
“I want to wake up from this,” Tamara told Mr. Stoner.

WASHINGTON — It turns out that the Federal Reserve is not quite ready to let go of its extra efforts to help the economy grow.        


All summer, Federal Reserve officials said flattering things about the economy’s performance: how strong it looked, how well it was recovering, how eager they were to step back and watch it walk on its own.        
But, in a reversal that stunned economists and investors on Wall Street, the Fed said on Wednesday that it would postpone any retreat from its monetary stimulus campaign for at least another month and quite possibly until next year. The Fed’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, emphasized that economic conditions were improving. But he said that the Fed still feared a turn for the worse.        
He noted that Congressional Republicans and the White House were hurtling toward an impasse over government spending. That was reinforced on Wednesday, when House leaders said they would seek to pass a federal budget stripping all financing for President Obama’s signature health care law, increasing the chances of a government shutdown.        
And the Fed undermined its own efforts when it declared in June that it intended to begin a retreat by the end of the year, causing investors to immediately begin to demand higher interest rates on mortgage loans and other financial products, a trend that the Fed said Wednesday was threatening to slow the economy.        
“We have been overoptimistic,” Mr. Bernanke said at a news conference Wednesday. The Fed, he said, is “avoiding a tightening until we can be comfortable that the economy is in fact growing the way that we want it to be growing.”        
Investors cheered the Fed’s hesitation. The Standard & Poor’s 500 stock-index rose 1.22 percent, to close at a record high, in nominal terms. Interest rates also fell; the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury reversed some of its recent rise.        
Some analysts, however, warned that the unexpected announcement was likely to worsen confusion about the Fed’s plans, increasing the volatility of the markets in the coming months as investors sort through the Fed’s mixed messages about how much longer it plans to continue its bond-buying campaign. The delay also means that the decision to retreat may ultimately be made by the next Fed chairman, after Mr. Bernanke steps down at the end of January. President Obama has said that he plans to nominate a replacement as soon as next week. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s vice chairman, is the leading candidate.        
“The cost of not setting out on a default gradual glide path for completing QE3 today is that this issue is now likely to be front and center in the nomination and confirmation process for the new Fed chair,” wrote Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at the financial services firm International Strategy & Investment, referring to the Fed’s asset purchases of quantitative easing.        
The Fed unrolled an aggressive combination of new policies last year in an effort to encourage a housing recovery and increase the pace of job creation. It started adding $85 billion a month to its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, to help keep long-term borrowing costs down and said it planned to keep buying until the outlook for the labor market improved substantially. The Fed also said it would keep short-term rates near zero for even longer — at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent.        
Half a year later, in June, Mr. Bernanke surprised many investors by announcing that the Fed intended to start cutting back on those asset purchases by the end of 2013. Fed officials reiterated that intention in July, and several officials had since suggested that the Fed might begin to pull back at the September meeting. It is also scheduled to meet next month and in mid-December.        
Some critics question the Fed’s assessment of the economy, in particular its claim that a declining unemployment rate is a sign of progress. They note that unemployment is falling in part because fewer people are looking for work, and therefore are no longer officially counted as unemployed.

MILAN — Are there “One Thousand and One Nights” when you could go out wearing a Gucci dress, visible bra under sheer mesh top and a skirt with a digitally enlarged Art Deco pattern?        


There are probably many hundreds of dress-up evenings available to the Glam Slam clientele whom the designer Frida Giannini seems to be after. They are the people for whom the 1980s, of happy memory, was rather too low key — although they might like the sporty vibe running through the Gucci show: giant T-shirts, suede bomber jackets, silken jogging pants and mesh tops cut out of strips of suede that also dangled as fringe from the black bamboo handles of shoulder bags.        
Seldom has active wear looked so big and bold. But it seemed a shame, after all that gym exercise and toning, that nothing was designed to fit — although shapely legs emerged from slits in the floaty dresses.        
Ms. Giannini had the words for it: “ethereal physicality.”        
Backstage, the designer also said “Erté,” referring to the pseudonym of the graphic designer Romain de Tirtoff whose distinctive prints defined the 1920s and who famously created ensembles for Paul Poiret’s “The Thousand and Second Night” ball in 1911.        
What did all that historical background mean for Gucci? Gorgeous colors — rich and deep, but dark (especially for summer). The oranges and pinks in sinuous patterns gave way to purple, pink and those greenery-yallery colors of the era.        
Ms. Giannini has had other bouts of historic inspiration, some of which have been brilliant, others less so. This show was in the latter category, because the clothes needed rigorous lines, not slithery softness, to make sense of the pattern. And because orientalism, with its kimono sleeves and elongated silhouette, looks too much like costume.        
Maybe sport and cocktails just don’t mix so well. And the visible bra surely is, even for the flashiest wearer, well past its sell-by date.

MILAN — Said Stefano Pilati about his first collection for Agnona: “What I love about the women’s wear is that it’s a universe you don’t know if you are a man.”        


“It’s much more challenging, less objective” than men’s wear, the designer said. “And then the fabrics are different. There’s the movement. They are all criteria.”        
The designer kicked off the Milan collections on Wednesday by opening to a select few fashionable women the doors of a discreet branded shop.        
Instead of a show with an audience, the invited visitors, who are encouraged to buy the clothes, saw mannequins with calf hooves instead of human legs. They reflected Mr. Pilati’s message: at Agnona, it all starts with a wooly lamb.        
He might have added that silk also plays a strong role in the Collection Zero, named, the designer said, not because it was his first show for the brand, but for the European art movement started in Agnona’s early years in the 1950s.        
At 60 years young, Agnona, founded in 1953 and part of the Ermenegildo Zegna luxury group, is beginning a new life to make it into what Gildo Zegna, the company’s chief executive, calls a “complete collection” — from fully tailored wool jackets to light dresses in printed silk organza. But at the heart of the 66 different pieces, with 25 different fabrics in 23 colors, is the company’s origins in nature.        
“Stefano went to the archives and selected colors and materials, but had it redone in a modern way,” said Mr Zegna. “At the beginning, there were a lot of pictures of natural life with greenery and baby lambs. It is going back to our roots.”        
An example of the new approach is the meld of silk with wool and the reimagining of an iconic fabric and pattern, long worn in Hawaii, that its residents call “palaka.” The check-style pattern was even replicated on a crocodile jacket.        
The substantial collection gave the impression of beautifully made clothes for modern women in the real world of work or relaxation. Fresh silk dresses, some cut at an angle, and tailored coats in featherlight, double-face cashmere, competed with slender suits in bright colors and more casual shorts and tops. One particular shade of light yellow is dubbed ‘’baby sun.”        
Mr. Pilati, formerly with Yves Saint Laurent in Paris, picked up on a theme that is already having traction for the Milan summer 2014 season: the post-Marilyn glamour, out in the fresh air in the late 1950s and ’60s.        
The backdrop at the DSquared2 show took a similar theme — but with a very different impression. The setting was a patch of rich greenery, a bar with wicker roof and bamboo, where the models sat enjoying cocktails under their bold sunhats.        
Heaven knows how they found room for even an olive in the tight corset tops that, along with high-waisted bikinis and full skirts under wasp waists, suggested a beach era when taking a plunge was not the thing.        
Dean and Dan Caten, the duo behind the DSquared label, put on a good show and a powerful front row, including Ireland Baldwin, Kim Basington’s daughter with Alex Baldwin.        
Take away Elvis singing “Little Sister,” the lush red lipstick, the two prong-high heels spiking the runway sand and those big hats — and there was a collection of sporty summer clothes for today.

Bill de Blasio now has the endorsement of not one, but two potential contenders for president.        


Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, via a spokesman, said in a statement on Wednesday that she and former President Bill Clinton would back Mr. de Blasio in New York City’s mayoral race — hardly a surprise given that Mr. de Blasio was Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager in her successful 2000 campaign for Senate.        
The support from the Clintons came two days after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo — who, like Mrs. Clinton, is believed to be mulling a run for president in 2016 — offered a full-throated endorsement of Mr. de Blasio during an event at City Hall. Mr. Cuomo served with Mr. de Blasio in the Clinton administration.        
The Clintons did not exactly offer a shout-to-the-heavens style of endorsement: they announced their support in a 48-word, single-paragraph statement attributed to their respective spokesmen and released in a no-frills e-mail by the de Blasio campaign.        
“Bill de Blasio has been a friend to both President Clinton and Secretary Clinton for many years,” the statement read. “They were proud to see him run a thoughtful, creative campaign about the issues, and they are behind him as he moves on to the general election.”        
There are no current plans for the Clintons, both of whom reside in Westchester County and maintain offices in Manhattan, to appear with Mr. de Blasio during the mayoral campaign.        
With friendly ties to several contenders in the mayoral primaries this year, the Clintons had declined until now to endorse a candidate. But Mr. de Blasio finished first in the Democratic primary last week, with 40.88 percent of the vote according to the latest tally, released on Wednesday. And now his party’s leaders and key allies, including the United Federation of Teachers, which endorsed him on Wednesday, are rallying behind him as he turns toward a general election campaign against Joseph J. Lhota, a Republican.        
At an appearance on Friday, Mr. de Blasio took pains to note that he had received phone calls from both Bill and Hillary Clinton soon after the primary.        
“They both offered extraordinarily helpful advice,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding, “I am proud to come from the Clinton family.”        
This is not Mrs. Clinton’s first foray into the mayoral race, although her earlier role was a somewhat unwitting one.        
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, casting about for a suitable successor, asked Mrs. Clinton in a phone conversation last year, while she was still secretary of state, if she would consider running, suggesting that her clout and experience made her a perfect fit. Those familiar with the conversation said she made her intentions unequivocally clear: She was not interested.

PARIS — Air France informed union representatives Wednesday that it planned to eliminate an additional 2,800 jobs, or 5 percent of its work force, by the end of next year, as the carrier scrambles to return to profitability.         
“We are in a period of weak demand,” Frédéric Gagey, the airline’s chief executive, said after a three-hour meeting with Air France employee councils. “We are facing the full brunt of the cyclicality of air transport.”        
Like many companies in Europe, Air France continues to struggle in the face of a weak economy and rising unemployment.        
The airline announced 5,100 job cuts in June 2012, part of a broader restrucuring plan at the parent company, the French-Dutch group Air France-KLM. Alexandre de Juniac, the chief executive of Air France-KLM, said the group would probably report a net loss for 2013 — a sixth consecutive annual loss — falling short of an initial goal of breaking even. But he expects the additional measures will restore the company to profitability by the end of 2014.        
Responding to pressure from the Socialist government in France to avoid job losses, Air France said the latest staff reductions would be achieved largely through a mix of voluntary departures, early retirements, attrition and reduced working hours. Negotiations with unions on the new cuts will begin on Oct. 4, the company said.        
“I believe the whole company is mobilized to confront this second challenge,” Mr. de Juniac said.        
Air France, which has some of the highest labor costs among European airlines, has struggled to remain competitive in the face of the region’s prolonged economic downturn, stubbornly high fuel expenses and fierce competition from the region’s low-cost carriers. Rapidly expanding carriers in Asia and the Gulf region are squeezing full-service carriers like Air France, Lufthansa and British Airways on long-distance routes.        
Michel Salomon, a spokesman for the Air France branch of the union, the Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail, acknowledged that the current economic situation had left Air France in “fragile” health, and that significant reductions were unavoidable. But he questioned whether management’s targets could be achieved solely through voluntary means.        
“The number is extremely heavy,” he said. “Without offering extremely attractive terms, there is no guarantee that they will be able to avoid layoffs.”        
Air France is one of several European flag carriers overhauling their operations by reducing flights and shutting down unprofitable routes while increasing investment in low-cost subsidiaries that compete head-to-head with the likes of Ryanair and EasyJet.        
But analysts said pressure from the French government — which owns a 15.9 percent stake in Air France — to limit layoffs last year may have led management to be less aggressive in its initial restructuring plan.        
“The first wave was not sufficient to reach the targets set by the company,” said Yan Derocles, an airline analyst at Oddo Securities in Paris. “They may have been a bit timid,” he said, noting that, compared with peers like Lufthansa of Germany or British Airways, “there is still a huge gap in terms of the flexibility of employees, the number of hours for the pilots and cabin crews, etc.”        
Mr. de Juniac conceded Wednesday that the plan announced last year had not gone far enough. The new measures — which he vowed would be sufficient — were expected to yield an additional 400 million euros to 450 million euros, or $534 million to $601 million, in cost savings by the end of 2014.        
Despite the slower-than-expected progress, the airline’s overhaul has begun to bear fruit.        
Air France-KLM’s net loss shrank to 163 million euros for the three months to June 30 from 897 million euros a year earlier. Its net debt has shrunk to 5.3 billion euros from 6 billion euros at the end of 2012.        
Mr. Gagey, the Air France chief, said the airline planned to migrate more of its domestic French services to its low-cost subsidiary, Transavia, while a number of money-losing routes between French provincial cities would be curtailed. Transavia would also begin operating several new routes out of Paris’s secondary airport, Orly, to European destinations, beginning next summer. Air France also plans to continue to reduce its fleet of dedicated cargo planes, though it will continue to carry freight on board its passenger jets.

LONDON — As the last gleaming, pearl-trimmed shoe disappeared from the runway, Simone Rocha took a lightning bow, before greeting backstage her two most important guests: Her parents.        


With her mother, Odette, as a partner in her fledgling company and her father, John Rocha, a fixture at the London fashion shows and Ireland’s most famous designer, Ms. Rocha, 27, is growing her business from family roots. While luxury groups are sniffing around other promising British designers, she has her own luxury of doing as the Italians do: the family way.        
“We never set out to becoming a fashion family. But I always grew up in my dad’s studio, learning skills and how to crochet and knit,” says Ms. Rocha. “It’s unusual to be a fashion family coming from Ireland — and then my dad is Chinese!”        
The designer discussed a childhood where everyone, in a house filled with artists and musicians, seemed to be a “character” and how that gave her a taste for originality and independence.        
“When I think of growing up, it was MTV and hanging out with my friends,” she said. “But it’s a really special place, Ireland, so rich culturally — so human.”        
The Simone Rocha show on the closing day of London Fashion Week was a fine example of that meld of strong spirit coupled with high quality from the family atelier. She was trained first in Dublin and then in London at Central Saint Martins, where the guidance of Louise Wilson, who directs the master’s course at the prestigious fashion school, brought out a strong focus. Or as the designer puts it: “After two years with Louise, I knew my own identity — exactly what I wanted to say with my clothes.”        
“I am naturally attracted to feminine things, but I want to bring them somewhere different, or to put together in a ‘wrong’ way,” Ms. Rocha said.        
This show, her seventh, was about that edgy femininity, where black dresses, light in weight and with crunchy or shiny surfaces, worked through to a feather-light, gilded brocade-look material.        
The fabrics were mostly undefinable — materials like patent cotton and flower-embroidered plastic that she and her team developed, working with mills in a spirit of modernity.        
Then, as always, there were the classic pearls, her signature motif, milky white against the black and injecting a serene prettiness by edging knee-high stockings or decorating chunky accessories. Her shoes are already collectors’ items.        
It is rare for an emerging designer to have such a clear vision. The show seemed to contain her life circle: where she now lives in the gritty edginess of Dalston, in London’s rundown East End — even if Ms. Rocha has just moved into a spanking new studio, with her tiny work force creating crochet craftwork under framed images of Francis Bacon’s gut-wrenching art.        
Then there is her Irish side, which came out in the show in the sudden appearance of a coat in dark, rain-soaked leaf green and veils, like religious habits, but in flesh-colored tulle with a white cotton frill. In her programs she described inspirations as: “mourning, communion, isolation, union.”        
There is no specific sign of her half-Asian background, even though she has visited Hong Kong every year since her childhood to see her grandparents and now 13 cousins. But it cannot be a coincidence that, like so many fresh young designers in America, Asia is part of her DNA.        
Mr. Rocha, who has received recognition from the British government for services to fashion, said that the hardest thing for him was not to be able to help or direct his daughter, but to “let go.”        
“‘I can’t do anything. She is free and otherwise there is no point,” he says. “She has her own voice.”        
Ms. Rocha’s brother, working on the music side, is also part of the family mix.        
“I really want independence — and of course, like everyone, we have family fights,” she says. “We might want to do things differently, but we never come to blows!”

Tired of being thrust onto the front lines of the nation’s debate over guns, Starbucks is asking customers to leave firearms behind when they are in its stores and its outdoor seating areas.        


The policy change came after a shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday that left 13 people, including the gunman, dead. But Starbucks said its decision was not in response to that or to the shooting spree that killed 26 children and adults at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., just days before Christmas last year.        
“I’ve spent a significant amount of personal time on this issue in the last several months and I’ve seen the emotionally charged nature of this issue and how polarizing it is on both sides,” Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, said in a telephone interview. “Nevertheless, customers in many stores have been jarred and fairly uncomfortable to see guns in our stores, not understanding the issue and feeling that guns should not be part of the Starbucks experience, especially when small kids are around.”        
Under the change, baristas and other store employees will not ask customers who come in with guns in holsters, say, to leave or confront them in any way, Mr. Schultz said. No signs explaining the policy will be posted in Starbucks stores, either.        
“We are going to serve them as we would serve anyone else,” he said. “There are going to be people on both sides who will be disappointed or angry, but we’re making a decision we think is in the best interests of our customers, employees and the company.” He said store officials would evaluate compliance over time and consider posting signs if necessary.        
A majority of company-owned Starbucks stores are in states that allow people to openly carry guns, although restrictions and limitations vary from state to state. The company has had a handful of armed robberies in its stores over the years, as well as two recent incidents where guns carried in women’s purses have discharged accidentally, but little other gun violence in its stores.        
Under its previous policy, however, Starbucks has been unwillingly co-opted by proponents of “open carry” policies and vilified by those seeking stricter laws on gun ownership. Garry Trudeau devoted six consecutive days of his Doonesbury comic strip in 2010 to mocking the company’s stance, which opened with a barista greeting a customer in a plaid flannel shirt and saying, “Welcome to Starbucks, sir. Would you be openly carrying a weapon today?”        
“Pro-gun activists have used our stores as a political stage for media events misleadingly called ‘Starbucks Appreciation Days’ that disingenuously portray Starbucks as a champion of open carry,” Mr. Schultz wrote in an open letter to be published in ads in major newspapers.        
Last month, Starbucks closed a store in Newtown early after gun rights supporters wearing camouflage and Connecticut Citizens Defense League T-shirts held one of their events there.        
Similarly, opponents of military-style assault weapons in stores, like the group  Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, which advocated “Skip Starbucks Sundays,” have staged protests outside Starbucks stores and urged consumers to boycott the company.        
In 2010, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence teamed with Credo Action, an activist group that uses mobile technology and social media to push change, and attracted more than 40,000 signatures on a petition aimed at changing the company’s policy on guns in its stores that was delivered to Starbucks headquarters in Seattle.        
“It sounds like Howard Schultz is making a very good business decision,” said Brian Malte, director of legislation and mobilization at the Brady Campaign. “Lots of families with children, college students and young people are Starbucks customers, and they want to feel safe.”        
The company has long followed local laws regarding the ability to carry guns in plain sight. Customers in the 44 states that allow legal gun owners to carry weapons openly have been permitted in its stores there, while those in the six other states — New York, California, South Carolina, Illinois, Florida and Texas — have not, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.        
“I want to make it very clear that Starbucks is not a policy maker and as a company we are not pro- or anti-gun,” Mr. Schultz said. “However, there have been a number of episodes over the course of the last few months that have put us in a position to take a big step back and assess the issue of open carry.”        
Most other restaurant chains and retailers follow policies similar to the one Starbucks is abandoning, although Peet’s Coffee and Tea and California Pizza Kitchen ban guns from their stores altogether. Disney also forbids guns in its theme parks, and Costco does not allow its members to carry them openly in its stores.        
“While Peet’s Coffee and Tea respects and values all individuals’ rights under the law, like many other private retail establishments, our policy is not to allow customers carrying firearms in our stores or on our outdoor seating premises unless they are uniformed or identified law enforcement officers,” the company said in a statement forwarded by a spokeswoman.        
A spokeswoman for the National Restaurant Association said the organization did not have a list of its members’ policies on guns but noted that some states that have open carry laws on the books still prohibit public display of firearms in restaurants.

For almost four decades now, a late-night NBC show has begun with the words, “Live from New York, it’s Saturday night.” Beginning late Thursday night — early Friday morning, to be technical — another late-night NBC show will revisit a popular concept from long-ago television, live commercials.         
In a deal with the Lexus division of Toyota Motor, NBCUniversal, part of Comcast, will run live commercials for the next four weeks during the Thursday night episodes of “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon.” The commercials will be produced in real time, with the aid of social media, as viewers suggest ideas for the spots that will be performed by improvisational comedy troupes.        
The deal, for undisclosed financial terms, is being called “It’s Your Move After Dark,” and will be promoted by NBC on late-night programs Wednesday night.        
The deal is emblematic of the efforts that media companies and marketers are making to keep consumers from zipping through, zapping or avoiding traditional peddling tactics like commercials. The idea of live spots, created in real time through viewer suggestions in social media, sounds like something that will pique the curiosity of viewers of late-night TV, particularly younger men and women.        
Here is how the deal is supposed to work. During an early commercial break in the “Late Night” episode, viewers will be asked to propose ad concepts through social media platforms like Facebook, Tumblr and Twitter, using the hashtag #LexusIS. (The live spots are intended to help Lexus introduce the 2014 IS model.)        
Then, during the last commercial break of the episode, members of one of four improv troupes — Fun Young Guys, Magnet Theater Touring Company, MB’s Dream and Stone Cold Fox — will perform a spot based on or inspired by the audience’s submissions. The performances will come from under the Brooklyn Bridge rather than the NBC studios in Rockefeller Center.        
NBCUniversal executives say there will be two commercials created during each of the next four Thursday nights/Friday mornings, one when the episode of “Late Night” appears in the Eastern time zone and one when the episode is shown in the Western time zone. The actual episodes will be taped, as “Late Night” typically is; the spots will be live islands in a sea of taped television.        
Live commercials were once mainstays of TV, especially during NBC programs like “Today” and “Tonight.” Marketers like Polaroid and Timex took advantage of the spots unfolding in real time to offer viewers dramatic demonstrations of photographs developing “instantly” or how a watch could take a licking and keep on ticking.        
In one vintage Polaroid spot, the NBC variety show host Perry Como seems to anticipate by decades the arms-out gesture of cellphone camera users when he simulates taking a photograph of himself — a “selfie” — with the actor Don Ameche, the Polaroid spokesman.

CLAIM TO FAME After making short films for Opening Ceremony, Ms. Antonopoulos formed a noisy guitars-and-electric-beats duo called Cable, which quickly became an art- and fashion-world favorite. Months after forming, Cable played at Timo Weiland’s show during Fashion Week and at a party for Bullett Magazine.        
BIG BREAK Ms. Antonopoulos’s close friend Gia Coppola (the granddaughter of Francis Ford Coppola) asked her to help direct a short film for Opening Ceremony’s new store at the Ace Hotel in New York. In it, Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman (Ms. Coppola’s cousin) gallivant through dark bars and bright gardens, drink bottles of Coke and wear items from the spring-summer 2010 collection. “We were both really into French New Wave,” Ms. Antonopoulos said. From that came more projects with Opening Ceremony, and a film for the French brand A.P.C.        
LATEST PROJECT Earlier this summer, Ms. Antonopoulos shot a video for X-Girl, a clothing line once owned by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, that was projected on giant outdoor screens in the Harajuku district of Tokyo. The video harks back to the early ’90s film “Kids,” with 20-somethings hanging off SoHo fire escapes, ripping off dirty T-shirts and drinking beers on rooftops. Instead of hiring models or actors, Ms. Antonopoulos enlisted her fresh-faced friends. “I wanted it to be my world in New York, cool people I know just goofing around,” she said.        
NEXT THING She formed Cable last year with Benjamin Morsberger, while both worked for the photographer Ryan McGinley. For their next single, “Roxanne,” due out this month, the duo teamed up with Dev Hynes of Blood Orange. “He’s one of my best friends, so it really just worked out,” Ms. Antonopoulos said. Her new production company, Tank, will handle the release and accompanying video. There’s no shying away from ambition. “With Cable, we want to make music and videos and content for the masses,” she said.        
DOUBLE IDENTITY With her fiery red hair and nerd-chic look, she certainly stands out. But she’s also happy behind the camera. “I like to view Cable and me as like Peter Parker and Spider-Man,” she said. “The stuff I do on a regular basis is Peter Parker, and Cable is Spider-Man. It’s like a movie. With music, you kind of have to act out what you’re singing about.” NATE FREEMAN

E J Manuel was 25-6 as a starter at Florida State. He led the Seminoles to four consecutive bowl victories and ended his career with a 66.9 completion percentage, the best in the storied program’s history.        


Yet he was considered by many prognosticators to be near the bottom of the top tier of quarterback prospects for the 2013 draft. It was an analysis that stung Manuel, who has size (6 feet 4 inches, 237 pounds), arm strength and mobility. He felt unfairly overlooked.        
“I’m sure he felt like that,” his father, Erik, said by phone from his home in Chesapeake, Va. “We would have conversations about that.”        
Erik Manuel remembered one talk several months before the April draft that ended with his son vowing, “Dad, I’m going to be the first quarterback taken.”        
The more teams familiarized themselves with Manuel, the more enamored they became. He has a work ethic and meticulousness that comes, at least in part, from his father, a former supply analyst for the Air Force now employed in the hazardous materials unit of the Department of Defense. He possesses an air of professionalism stemming from his godfather, Bruce Smith, a Hall of Fame defensive end who played for the Bills. He also had a life experience that provided him with a mature perspective: his mother, Jackie, received a diagnosis of breast cancer before his senior season and underwent difficult but successful treatment.        
“As the process went on, it is not just about athletic ability and arm strength,” said Mike Mayock, an analyst for NFL Network. “It’s what kind of kid is he? Is he a gym rat? Do we trust him? They kept crossing off those boxes and saying, ‘Yeah, we like him.’ ”        
The Bills apparently liked him most of all. They chose Manuel with the 16th pick in the draft, making him the first quarterback taken. The next one, Geno Smith, went to the Jets with the 39th pick.        
Since Jim Kelly ended his Hall of Fame career in 1996, Buffalo has had a rotating cast at quarterback. Todd Collins, Rob Johnson, Doug Flutie, Alex Van Pelt, Drew Bledsoe, J. P. Losman, Kelly Holcomb, Trent Edwards and Ryan Fitzpatrick have all started at least eight games since the Kelly era. The Bills hope that with Manuel they have finally found a quarterback who can help them end a string of 13 consecutive seasons without reaching the playoffs, the N.F.L.’s longest postseason drought.        
On Sunday at MetLife Stadium, Manuel and the Bills will face Smith and the Jets. Each rookie has a 1-1 record as a starter, but the similarity ends there. Manuel, despite missing the final two preseason games to have minor surgery on his left knee, has completed 68.2 percent of his passes (45 of 66) for 446 yards with 3 touchdowns and an interception for a passer rating of 95.9. Smith, slowed much of the preseason with a sprained right ankle, has converted 53.4 percent of his throws (39 of 73) for 470 yards with a touchdown and 4 interceptions for a 55.2 passer rating.        
Manuel, perhaps in a sign of how quickly he recognizes defenses and processes information, has been sacked just once so far, for a loss of 9 yards. Smith has been sacked nine times, for 67 yards in losses.        
Manuel, in an interview during training camp in Pittsford, N.Y., said of the challenge of righting a team that finished at the bottom of the A.F.C. East with a 6-10 record last season: “I look forward to it. I don’t necessarily see myself as a savior or anything. I just want to come in and help.”        
Manuel is doing that. He finished an 80-yard, nine-play drive with a 2-yard touchdown toss to Stevie Johnson with two seconds remaining when rallying the Bills to a 24-23 victory at home against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.        
He made it sound routine, too.        
“We knew the situation; I didn’t feel nervous or anything like that,” Manuel said after the game. “We’ve practiced it time and time again. I’ve been in two-minute situations before, not just in the N.F.L. in practice, but in college, and we’ve won games like that before.”        
Although Manuel completed 27 of 39 passes for 296 yards with one touchdown and one interception against Carolina, Doug Marrone, the Bills’ first-year coach, said: “There’s a lot of things that we have to clean up with him. There are a lot of mistakes that are out there that he committed that we don’t expect him to make.”        
According to Marrone, Manuel welcomed his criticism.        
“The one thing about E J is he’s hard on himself,” Marrone said. “We like that in our players.”        
Doug Whaley, in his first year as the Bills’ general manager, was drawn to Manuel by that quality and others that cannot be measured by a stopwatch or a scale. “He has a presence about him,” he said. “Most successful quarterbacks in the N.F.L. have a presence about them.”        
Whaley added, “Not only has he validated that point, but he’s shown us this isn’t too big for him, being the face and future of the franchise.”        



 



"
RealEstate,"










After Lauren Strachan graduated from Rutgers University, where she studied acting, she rented briefly in New York. She waited tables, auditioned and “basically lived the life of a starving artist,” she said.        


Some friends of her parents mentioned a curious job that seemed right for her — a kind of “shopping host” on a cruise ship. The topic arose several times. “All these people talked about a job I had never heard of that they thought I would be good at,” Ms. Strachan said. “I had never set foot on a ship in my entire life.”        
She landed the job, which entailed promoting retailers in the various ports of call. Once her seasickness passed, she loved it.        
Home was a private cabin that was so tiny she could extend her arms and touch both walls. After almost four years, one of the companies she promoted, Diamonds International, offered her a stateside job as director of public relations and communications.        
So, two years ago, she returned to New York, sharing a two-bedroom rental in Astoria, Queens, with a good friend. She paid $1,000 a month. She traveled often, dreading the fourth-floor climb with heavy luggage. And the location near the elevated Astoria Boulevard station meant inescapable subway noise.        
Ms. Strachan, now 31, was eager to buy an apartment in Manhattan. Last winter, she attended an open house in a small elevator co-op building in Chelsea. The alcove studio was listed for $434,000, with monthly maintenance in the mid-$800s. A skylight and an exposed brick wall caught her eye.        
But “the bed was literally in the foyer,” a kind of windowless sleeping area near the door, she said. “It was scary to see what the real estate market was like.”        
At the open house she met Gabriela Vatamanu, an agent at the Corcoran Group. Ms. Strachan enlisted her help in hunting for a one-bedroom.        
She was ambivalent about new condominiums, soon realizing she disliked the typical condo layout, with a rectangle for a living room and a square for a bedroom. “There were no hallways, no nooks and crannies,” she said. “It was boring to me.”        
As for duplexes, “I couldn’t deal with the curly stairs — they were the worst,” she said. Sometimes an apartment was great, but the building seemed dim or dingy.        
The first place Ms. Strachan really liked was a one-bedroom in a prewar co-op building on Park Avenue in the 30s. The price was $499,000, with monthly maintenance in the low $1,500s. She loved the elegant old-school feel of the lobby.        
“I understood what I was looking for after I saw this apartment,” she said. It had high beamed ceilings and a fireplace. But the living room was dark, the kitchen tiny and the neighborhood mostly office buildings. She kept looking.        
As time passed, Ms. Strachan’s budget rose. Initially, she thought $400,000 would be adequate. After all, her friends in other cities had enormous houses for less.        
“All of a sudden, I was at $600,000 and O.K. with it,” she said. Her savings were sufficient — at sea, she had paid no room and board, so her expenses had been low.        
“She raised her price to $700,000 and that’s where we started to see more of what she liked,” said Ms. Vatamanu, who suspected what she wanted was likely to be found on the Upper East Side.        
Ms. Strachan liked quite a few places there, including one on East 79th Street with a floor plan that included a foyer and even a couple of short hallways. The price was $599,000, with monthly maintenance in the mid $1,300s. Alas, it required more renovating than she was up for.        
She immediately loved an apartment in a charming prewar co-op building nearby.The doorman ran the elevator. “When I saw the old elevator being operated, that was such a nice touch,” she said. “I was getting excited just in the hallway.”        
This apartment, with its many built-in bookshelves, lived up to its building. Ms. Strachan was especially pleased by the floor plan, which had a large foyer that branched out “like a T or a cross,” she said. “You can walk into any room and circle around. You could Hava Nagila in the apartment.”        
Both bathroom and kitchen had windows. “I never thought I would like yellow in a kitchen, but this is the cutest I’ve ever seen,” she said. Though the view, out the back, wasn’t especially sunny, “it was quintessentially so New York,” with brick walls and fire escapes.        
However, there were other apartments on her list to check out. A one-bedroom on East 86th Street also had built-in bookshelves, as well as a washer-dryer in the kitchen. The price was $675,000 with monthly maintenance in the mid-$1,300s. The subway was just downstairs.        
But the immediate neighborhood seemed too commercial, with big-box retailers on the block. “The hustle and bustle of the Best Buy was way too much for me,” she said. “I wanted to walk out of the building and feel peaceful.”        
So it was back to the one-bedroom in the 70s, which she bought for $631,000 after splitting the 2 percent flip tax with the seller. She arrived early in summer, thrilled at her landing spot. “I have been struggling to have New York feel like my home,” she said. “Finally, I feel like I belong in New York.”        
Next year, the building intends to automate the elevator, a change that is fine with her. She plans to add brighter lighting in the bedroom.        
When “all the lights are off in the middle of the day, you would never know the sun is shining beautifully,” Ms. Strachan said. But she is philosophical: “You take what you take. When you find the one you fall in love with, you also have to accept the things that don’t quite make you happy. You accept those little aspects of people and of apartments.”

                            Before Ronan Noone’s play “The Compass Rose” begins, you wait to see if life will subtly transform into theater. You look around the bar that is its site-specific setting and take note of the details. Will the bartender who can flip a shot glass in the air and catch it behind his back become a character? Will the atmosphere in the room shift from cozily humdrum to ritually charged?        


                            Alas, no such magic occurs. “The Compass Rose,” a disappointing two-character drama that is part of the annual 1st Irish Festival, starts as plays do, with a warning about cellphones. Then there’s a harsh change in lighting, and we’re off.        

                            David Mitchell plays Donal, an Irish immigrant and a bartender. (Good thing he’s not a butcher or a sanitation worker.) And Olivia Horton is Tiffany, the spoiled American who invites him along for a cross-country car trip. They squabble and flirt and fall in improbable love before she abandons him in Las Vegas. Ten years later, when she shows up in his bar, he’s still pining for her.        

                            On Sunday night Mr. Mitchell and Ms. Horton never seemed particularly comfortable roaming the bar-cum-theater (Ryan’s Daughter on East 85th Street). Sometimes they were very close to audience members — during one scene my view was of the thin wales on the seat of Mr. Mitchell’s corduroys — but their self-consciousness was infectious. People tended to look away when the action was too near them, as if they didn’t want to intrude on actors acting.        

                            Not that “The Compass Rose,” directed by David Sullivan, would be much better on a traditional stage. It has a hole where its emotional heart should be. The main problem is Tiffany — Tiffany Jones, no less — a teasingly inaccessible and self-satisfied princess. Perhaps to Donal she’s as much a vision of America — attractive, callow, materialistic — as she is a person.        

                            Either way, his interplay with her is unconvincing and their romance hard to credit. The tone of wistful mourning — for lost love, lost illusions — never jells. All you can think is, Donal, you dodged a bullet.

Pandora Media won a battle in its continuing war with the music industry over royalties when a federal judge ruled on Tuesday that the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, which represents thousands of members, cannot prevent Pandora from licensing all the songs in its catalog.        


The ruling, by Judge Denise L. Cote of United States District Court in Manhattan, is a blow to music publishers, who have tried to get the best royalty rates for digital music by limiting the extent that performing rights societies like Ascap and Broadcast Music Incorporated represent their songs. The ruling could also hurt the societies themselves if they are perceived as preventing the publishers from getting higher rates.        
Two years ago, the industry’s biggest publishers began withdrawing digital rights to their music from Ascap and BMI, forcing companies like Pandora to negotiate directly for a license to stream the music.        
Sony/ATV, the world’s largest publisher, has said it received a 25 percent higher rate by licensing its songs to Pandora directly.        
Pandora argued in a motion for summary judgment that allowing publishers to withdraw their digital rights violated Ascap’s longtime consent decree, which says that the organization must license its songs to any service that asks. The judge agreed, saying that Ascap must make all the songs in its catalog available to Pandora through 2015, when its current licensing terms with Internet radio provider expire. If Ascap licenses a song for some purposes, the judge ruled, it must for others – like streaming — as well.        
“ 'All’ means all,” Judge Cote wrote in her decision. The ruling precedes a larger rate-setting trial between Pandora and Ascap, which will begin on Dec. 4.        
In a statement, Christopher Harrison, Pandora’s assistant general counsel, said, “We hope this will put an end to the attempt by certain Ascap-member publishers to unfairly and selectively withhold their catalogs from Pandora.”        
John LoFrumento, Ascap’s chief executive, said he looked forward to the trial. “The court’s decision to grant summary judgment on this matter has no impact on our fundamental position in this case that songwriters deserve fair pay for their work, an issue that the court has not yet decided.”        
The larger effect of the ruling is unclear. On Wednesday, a spokesman for Sony/ATV said he expected that the terms of the deal would not change because of Judge Cote’s ruling.        
BMI, which like Ascap represents a huge portion of the music available in the United States, operates under its own consent decree, and is governed by a different federal rate court. BMI sued Pandora in June over rates, a few days after Pandora said it would buy a small radio station in South Dakota to qualify for rates enjoyed by terrestrial broadcasters. Ascap has also asked the Federal Communications Commission to block that sale.        
Pandora, which has more than 70 million regular users, was once the darling of the music world. But over the last year it has become one of industry’s biggest opponents as it pushes for lower royalty rates. Last year, it heavily promoted the Internet Radio Fairness Act, a failed bill in Congress that could have reduced what services like Pandora pay record companies and performing artists.        
Pandora’s efforts to reduce costs and increase its advertising revenue have helped push the company’s stock higher; by Wednesday afternoon, shares were up about 2 percent.

TOUCH-SCREEN phones have become so astonishingly good at some tasks they have all but replaced landline phones, pocket cameras and printed maps. But there is one feature that they still struggle to get right — the keyboard. The flexibility of the full touch screen has won out over tactile, physical buttons, leaving us with a keyboard that is just an image on glass and small keys that sometimes get cranky around big thumbs.         
Still, users don’t have to settle for the default keyboard on their smartphone. The advantage to virtual keyboards is just that — they are virtual — and can be easily swapped or altered for one you like better. Sometimes all it takes is a change in your settings. At most, it requires buying an app.        
Here’s a sampling of tips and apps to help improve your typing experience on Apple iOS and Android, the two most popular operating systems for smartphones.        
FEWER TAPS Many smartphone users make the mistake of tapping out whole words one letter at a time. A quick way to speed up typing on almost all phones is through predictive text. Once the feature is turned on, the device will predict what word you are typing after filling in only a letter or two. Choosing the full word takes just a single tap.        
To turn on predictive text, you’ll have to dig through the menus, under settings. Look for the keyboard options and select “auto correction,” or whatever the similar name is on your phone. Then start typing, and when the complete word appears, usually in a list just above the keyboard, tap it. The best part is, the predictions usually improve over time, as the device learns which words you prefer. So the more you use it, the more time it will save you.        
Another option is using a nonstandard keyboard layout, like the one provided by Fast Keyboard, a free app for Apple products. With the app, you won’t need to keep switching the keyboard from letters to numbers — they all appear on the same screen. Symbol keys like hashtags appear on the screen, too, and cut, copy and other functions are also within reach.        
The downside of the app (and other auxiliary keyboards for Apple products) is that it doesn’t completely replace the default keyboard. It can be used for certain apps, like e-mail, text messaging and social media. Android replacement keyboards can work with all of its functions and apps.        
Fleksy, a free iPhone app meant to help the visually impaired, can help you type without looking at all. Just approximate tapping where you think letters belong on a keyboard. When you have completed a word, flick the screen to the right. Fleksy will read its guess aloud. Flick down for it to guess similar words. The sloppier you are the better it seems to work. But as with other auxiliary iPhone keyboards, it can’t completely replace the standard keyboard.        
HANDY CODE If you find yourself repeatedly using the same phrases over and over — and who doesn’t? — so-called typing expansion programs are for you.        
When using these programs, you assign an abbreviation like “omw” to automatically turn into “I’m on my way home, honey, need anything?”        
Typing expansion is built into Apple products and the free Android app Google Keyboard. For Apple products, go to Settings, then select General and then Keyboard. Click Add a New Shortcut, then enter the abbreviation and phrase you want it to become.        
In Google Keyboard, open the app and go to Personal Dictionary. Touch the plus sign and then add your abbreviation and phrase. Press done and the back button.        
One tip for all the devices: Make sure your shortcuts use unusual letter combinations so you don’t activate phrases at unwanted times.        
GESTURES Gesture keyboards figure out what you mean to type as you to trace your finger loosely over the keys. It is faster than single-letter typing, but before it becomes really accurate, it has to learn your patterns. Sometimes, the process can be exasperating. One keyboard developer said it takes at least 50 messages for these programs to learn your patterns.        
Swiftkey, a $4 app for Android, has an additional way to increase accuracy right off the bat. Give the app access to your Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail accounts and it will observe your vocabulary to better anticipate words you are likely to use. It has recently added a cloud backup service that saves your personal dictionary of often-used phrases in case your device is lost or dies. It also searches the Web for phrases coming into heavy use (like “sarin,” “twerking” or “Middleton”) to better guess what you are typing.        
Swype, a popular $1 gesture-based keyboard app for Android, can also check your Facebook, Twitter and Gmail accounts to improve accuracy, but it has long had a feature called “living language.” Activate it to anonymously collect new and unfamiliar words from across the Web and add them to the dictionary.        
Many phones already have gesture typing if you look in the settings. Usually it is under a heading like “Language and Keyboard” or “Language and Input.”        
For Apple products there are Swiftkey and Swype imitators but, like the previously mentioned Fleksy, they can be used only for writing text.        
PRIVACY SETTINGS There is a potentially alarming side to predictive technology. It is possible for an app to collect data that you would not want it to. Here is a warning that appeared when installing Google Keyboard: “This input method may be able to collect all of the text you type, including personal data like passwords and credit card numbers. It comes from the app Google Keyboard. Use this input method?”        
While reputable developers will tell you in their privacy policies that they don’t collect credit cards and passwords, you can take steps on your own.        
Turning off the option that shares to the cloud will increase your security (at the sacrifice of some accuracy), by keeping your personal dictionary on your phone only. Then be sure to lock your phone.

LOS ANGELES — “Salinger,” Shane Salerno’s documentary about the secret life of J. D. Salinger, is set to reveal some more secrets.         
The Weinstein Company on Wednesday said that it planned to release a “special edition” of the film on Sept. 20, with additional material about the author and “his complex relationships with young women.”        
The film, which opened in New York and Los Angeles on Sept. 6, included some details of Salinger’s relationships with young women, including an account of his long-running involvement with Jean Miller, whom he met when she was 14 and he was 30.        
But the documentary drew some criticism for failing to tell more about his attraction to and correspondence with teenage girls. Notably, Joyce Maynard, who had a relationship with the author when she was in her teens, wrote that the film underplayed the emotional damage to herself and others.        
On Wednesday, Weinstein also said it had agreed to develop a dramatic film about Salinger, focusing on the period between his service in World War II and the publication of “The Catcher in the Rye.”        
The script is to be written by Mr. Salerno, Weinstein said.

The latest designer store to join the bustling retail scene that surrounds Howard Street in SoHo, an area pioneered by Opening Ceremony, is around the corner at 148 Lafayette Street. If the address rings a bell, that is because it has appeared for 17 years on the label of one of fashion’s quietest success stories.        


Lafayette 148, as the company is known, is so quiet that you will not even notice the store from the street: it is on the eighth floor, and as yet there is no sign.        
Though it started with several stores in the New York area in the late 1990s, the company, known primarily for career-oriented sportswear that was originally manufactured at its SoHo headquarters, has focused for the last decade on its department-store business and its own online and catalog sales. Now it has 1,500 employees and a state-of-the-art factory in Shantou, China. Over the last two years, three stores have opened in China (with a fourth opening next week).         
But still customers showed up at the offices on Lafayette Street, looking for a store.        
“So it all pointed in one direction,” said Deirdre Quinn, the chief executive and a founder of Lafayette 148 with Shun Yen Siu, her partner in China.        
Earlier this year, as floors became available in the building, Lafayette 148, which maintains its showroom, administrative offices and sample-making facilities there, expanded. The eighth floor was chosen for the store, Ms. Quinn said, to reflect its symbolism for luck in Chinese culture. (It is for the same reason that the prices of all of its designs end in an eight.)        
And with 4,000 square feet, the company was able to create the kind of environment that is not possible in a traditional department store, with a full range of sizes, including petites and plus sizes, categories that have largely been dropped by Manhattan retailers.        
The store, which is open to the public on weekdays beginning this week and also by appointment, is an experiment for customers as much as it is a showcase for the retailers who shop the line there. In this setting, Lafayette 148 can present the line as it would want, showing luxury items and jewelry and calfskin totes, even custom evening dresses, not just the $248 white shirts in stretch cotton for which it is known. Of its more than 100,000 online customers, about 10 percent live in the metropolitan region, but many of them still want to try on clothes before buying.        
“Rather than opening in every mall in America, we wanted to find our own path,” said Paul Lechlinski, the company’s vice president for retail services.        
The elevators open onto a bright floor with windows facing east and west, just above the rooftops of neighboring buildings. A spiraling silver sculpture, chosen because it resembles a figure eight, sits on a table, near abstract black-and-white paintings by the company’s longtime design director, Edward Wilkerson. At the front of one rack is a rich burgundy calfskin jacket with laser-cut edges, for $1,998; in another display, a camel-to-citron, double-face cashmere jacket with leather trim for $698. There is also some serious statement jewelry, like an 18-karat gold-plated brass necklace that resembles a sea anemone.        
A department store might be nervous about ordering many of these designs, but the company can still produce them in limited quantities in as little as three weeks.        
While there is an obvious risk that no one will recognize there is a store upstairs, Ms. Quinn said there were other advantages to being in the same building in which the product is designed. Alterations, for example, can be handled by the original patternmaker downstairs. And if customers want a sneak preview of spring, they can always stop by the showroom on 2.

Brilliant or foolhardy? There were times during Tuesday night’s fabulously entertaining New York Philharmonic concert at Avery Fisher Hall when I found myself debating the pros and cons of the conceit behind “Hitchcock!,” the first of two programs in “The Art of the Score: Film Week at the Philharmonic.”        


Under the direction of Constantine Kitsopoulos, the Philharmonic performed extracts of scores to Hitchcock classics, including “Vertigo,” “North by Northwest” and “Strangers on a Train,” as scenes from the films played on a large screen above. From the side of the stage, the actor Alec Baldwin provided introductions and insightful commentary.        
If the plan was to attract large numbers of Philharmonic newbies with a combination of contemporary celebrity sparkle and old Hollywood polish, it worked: The hall was packed and the crowd as diverse as any I’ve seen at Lincoln Center. Presented a week before the official opening of the season, “Film Week” — which also includes performances of Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” — is like a platter of delicious amuse-bouches designed to drive traffic to the more substantial fare.        
But with Alfred Hitchcock’s genius competing for attention, was anyone really listening to the orchestra? As Cary Grant, in a scene from “To Catch a Thief,” streaked over the roof with catlike grace while French detectives roared through the countryside in hot pursuit of a car that — sacré bleu! — carried only the housekeeper, did anyone pay attention to the rhythmical verve and biting humor of Lyn Murray’s score?        
When Grace Kelly wrestled with the nighttime attacker sent to strangle her in “Dial M for Murder,” did anyone notice the orchestra’s glorious sound in Dimitri Tiomkin’s dark and powerful score with its allusion to the coronation scene from Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov”?        
As Mr. Baldwin pointed out, Hitchcock was deeply serious about music in his films, recognizing its power to express characters’ hidden desires and weaving it into a movie so skillfully that it became “ingrained in the visual fabric.” The scores to his films also became important marketing tools. A symphonic suite based on the score of “Rebecca” was widely toured after the movie’s release; in the case of “Spellbound,” the score, in a recording conducted by Leopold Stokowski, was broadcast on the radio even before the film’s release.        
One of the most fruitful collaborations was that between Hitchcock and the composer Bernard Herrmann, who composed scores for seven Hitchcock films, including “Psycho,” “North by Northwest” and “Vertigo.” In the last film especially, Herrmann’s music establishes a vocabulary of psychological states that is then used to underscore or undermine the characters’ actions: the dizzying triplets denoting vertigo; the screeching dissonant chord expressing the terror as the protagonist, dangling from a tall building, peers down into the abyss; the luscious, sighing strings that accompany the obsessive love story.        
The Philharmonic played the score to the “Vertigo” hotel scene with Wagnerian urgency. The strings produced a gorgeous rich sound that cooled into a lighter, queasy timbre as James Stewart stood at the window, bathed in green neon light. At that moment the concert felt like more than a case of luxury casting and became a vindication of the always self-effacing but often brilliant work of film composers.        



 
“2001: A Space Odyssey” will be presented with live music from the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Alan Gilbert, on Friday and Saturday at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org.

Styles,"










LONDON — This week, Tom Ford opened his 89th store, in London, where his company has its headquarters. “We’re in Baku,” he said, as he reeled off cities that, presumably, will carry his mirror-spangled dresses next spring. For its show, Burberry invited the impossibly cute Harry Styles of One Direction and the It girl Suki Waterhouse.        


England is home to some world-conquering fashion brands that derive a lot of their success from retail expertise and so-called entry-point products like perfumes and sunglasses. As it happens, both Mr. Ford and Christopher Bailey of Burberry made strong statements on their runways. In fact, Mr. Ford said he was really into an athletic-looking woman — hence the exaggerated shoulders of his leather outfits, the tapered waists and the leggy skirts.        
“I wasn’t thinking about ’80s supermodels,” he said.        
Poured into evening outfits that looked as if they were shot out of a can of black Silly String and then seemingly baked with a girdle of foil, his models definitely were more molten than glamorous. Mr. Ford’s spring daywear, such as it was, consisted of buckled-tight brown or white leather jackets, cinched black pantsuits and a slinky leather mesh tank top with a black-and-white leather skirt in a bubble pattern. Those outfits echoed his days at Gucci.        
But the evening clothes were in new territory, both in terms of style and technique. The ones paved with glittering fragments are a bit Elvis, or Rihanna, but they dissolve conventional lines between dressing up and performance. That’s not trivial when you consider how dull most red carpet fashion is. Mr. Ford said he got the idea for the mad squiggles and broken bits from the work of artists he admires, like José Parla and Mark Bradford. You’ll have to take his word for it that getting into a cobweb is a cinch.        
Mr. Bailey’s collection was more accessible. For starters, he called it “English Rose.” Aside from the pink and custard tones, the clothes nicely combined tradition and modern styling; lace for pencil skirts was produced in Nottingham, England. He showed them with shirts or plain cashmere sweaters. And instead of reinventing the trench coat in a gazillion fabrics, as he has done before, he gave the audience a breather — with soft, roomy coats in all those melting English colors.        
Of course, many people count on London for more than a garden party. Yet this was a tough season for young designers who once had a novel idea, like the ecstatic prints of Mary Katrantzou, and now seem to be toiling in the same path. Ms. Katrantzou created prints from blown-up images of shoes, but her fussy shapes held her back. I kept wondering why she didn’t try softer things like pajama pants and tunics. Erdem was another label determined to make a shrine out of couture; too many veiled garments.        
As I went around London, to places and streets filled with ordinary people, I had the sense, more than ever, that fashion here was taking place in vacuum. Do they care about Christopher Kane’s naïve drapes and twisted flower dresses? Or J. W. Anderson’s broken-down skirts or dresses with panels arrayed with rows of what resembled tiny takeout boxes in fabric — what he called “avant-bland”? If the public doesn’t appear to be even remotely listening, whom are we talking to?        
I actually blame the young stars. They are not being as innovative as they need to be. It’s that simple. You can fool the fashion press with a gimmick or a cool bit of styling, but you can’t fool ordinary people. And the public always recognizes heart-stopping fashion, as it did for designers from Chanel to McQueen.        
Mr. Kane had some lovely things: pleated skirts in delicate, slightly shimmery fabrics, a black pantsuit and some pastel dresses with petal-shaped cutouts rimmed in silver. But he spread himself too thin. He showed sweatshirts with feminine skirts, a style similar to ones he has done in the past. Last year, it was a Frankenstein T-shirt with a lace skirt. But since Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy made a big statement for fall with the same sweatshirt look, maybe Mr. Kane should have moved on.        
When I look back over his last four or five collections, there’s a clear, evolving body of design. This time, I saw too many tricks, like dresses with cord-suspended draping. He showed some shifts crowded with abstract flower appliqués and lace arrows. He has worked with lace and appliqué before. But again, is he advancing the idea or merely amplifying it? In May, Raf Simons created a Dior resort collection with floral embroidered lace.        
Mr. Anderson owes a clear debt to the Japanese designers of the ’80s. And it’s O.K. to be inspired by them — who hasn’t been? — but he runs the risk of serving up avant-garde lite. Also, based on things I see of his in stores, he is quite a clever designer, so I don’t understand the need for all the runway craftiness, unless it’s just to get media attention.        
Thomas Tait, by contrast, did a lot with a little. He used white leather, superfine knits, some feathers and athletic nylon, and created an elegant, thoroughly unpretentious collection. Though the fabrics are mostly practical, they’re beautifully cut. He, too, likes a skirt and a top, maybe with a lightweight coat, but he bends the look to his aesthetic. It’s not a ’50s pencil skirt; it’s loose, almost runny. If I saw a woman in these clothes, I’d be curious.        
Also worth paying attention to next spring is Simone Rocha for her pretty, full-skirted dresses traced with pearls; Jonathan Saunders for a broader use of sporty separates, like boyish, tricolor suede jackets and satin shorts; and Paula Gerbase of the minimalist label 1205, who has an implacable eye for proportion. The Meadham Kirchhoff designers get a little kitschy with their Europa fairy tale, but they make gingham and white eyelet skirts look tempting. Their jackets are handsome, too.        
Rounding out the shows was L’Wren Scott’s use of Tagasode (“Whose sleeves?”), 16th-century Japanese screens depicting garments draped on stands, as if waiting for their occupant to return. Well, there’s a sorcery quality in her femininity, too, and she brings it out with vivid reds, fan-patterned black lace and a crisp silhouette for daytime tweeds and cotton.

Culture,"










Bill Callahan may be easiest to describe by what he isn’t quite: a folkie; a country singer; a cloistered, primitivist weirdo with a four-track recorder; a poet or some other kind of words-only artist. Over the last 23 years, on a string of records made almost exclusively for the Chicago label Drag City, you sense that he’s walked past those doors, revising his ideas, waiting, looking for something.        


He’s found it. Listen through his astonishing new album, “Dream River,” and you will hear, lined up neatly, his trademarks. They’ve been floating around in his work recently, though perhaps not so deliberately; they didn’t seem like trademarks until now. But “Dream River” is evidence of a system, a working formula.        
Here is Mr. Callahan’s baritone voice, floating lightly in middle range and making quick and confident deep dives, putting strange bends on a phrase. Here is an image of a man alone in a hotel room; images of eagles and water — in fact, of an eagle flying over water, “alive and enjoying the ride.” (The idea of motion for its own sake is another Callahan trademark.) A rippling phase effect on Mr. Callahan’s rhythm-guitar strumming, like Waylon Jennings had in the mid-’70s. A small band with minimal percussion — sometimes only congas and clave sticks — playing spacious and ominous live arrangements in waltz or habanera, through songs that pause and turn in strange places. Words or expressions ritually expressed in twos or threes. And a narrative action first described and then imitated, like this, from the album’s first track, “The Sing”:        
The only words I’ve said today are beer and thank you        
Beer.../Thank you/Beer...        
Thank you        
Beer...        
Mr. Callahan is now 47 and has been based in Austin, Tex., for almost a decade. In the frequently scrappy or bitter music he made under the name Smog beginning in 1990, and then since he started using his own name on records in 2007, he’s been changing ensembles, sounds and strategies, making his work more country or less, more minimal or less, more disruptive or less. His work has suggested a great struggle to make songs that are both emotionally affecting and explosions of implied meaning: a kind of semantic-epistemological-metaphysical event. He seems to want to put everything in them now: love, death, fear, patience, transfiguration. He just doesn’t want to say any of it outright.        
This level of subtlety is not common in pop. Plenty of songwriters are oblique, but Mr. Callahan wants to connect. His records are literary without having a lot of words; they’re methodical slow drips of charged ideas that settle in the brain like a long poem or a novel. This one in particular is almost transparent: a wind blows through it. With a group of Austin musicians that has become more stable over the last few albums, he’s made a complex procedure sound easy.        
Mr. Callahan’s introverted voice, refined as it has become over the years, may never lose its essential awkwardness; he can still use it perversely. (This record’s final song, “Winter Road,” has a smash closer on paper: “I have learned when things are beautiful/ to just keep on.” Yet he stretches out “are” and “just,” the two dullest words of the couplet, into long froggy croaks over an F-minor chord; it’s a weirdly flat-footed move at an important moment.) He has a unified band sound now, and has let his lead-line instrumental players take major roles in it: Beth Galiger on flute brings a hopeful sound to a heavy-hearted scene, and Matt Kinsey, on electric guitar, is miraculous. Using echo and delay pedals and a tremolo bar, Mr. Kinsey keeps creeping in, bursting like a pink sky, and slipping away. His work on this record feels like one continuous performance, and one of the best by anyone I have heard this year.        
Mr. Callahan has said that he cares about putting a kind of buried story line in his records, from song to song. I don’t know about that, but there is a single consciousness that holds together “Dream River.” There’s always a force threatening to drag the narrator under in these songs: an icy road, a storm, a mate’s deep sleep, gravity. His characters are confused without admitting it, and they’re infantile around love, abjectly grateful for its power, seeking or offering it impulsively. On “Javelin Unlanding” he sings:        
Don’t die just yet        
And leave me        
Alone alone alone        
On this journey        
’round the sun        
Love is central to the record anyway, through all the subterfuge and indirection. This is an album in which a song that’s actually about flying (“Small Plane”) is, one level deeper, about a trusting relationship, and possibly an even better song about sex. Yet the next song, “Spring,” is explicitly about sex (the key couplet is “All I want to do is to make love to you/ in the fertile dirt”), but points to something else, something bigger and darker.        
What is it? Disappointment, decay. “We call it spring, though things are dying,” he sings. Then he rights himself: “The true spring is in you/ the true spring is in you.”        



 



"
Business,"










When the stock market prognosticator Joseph E. Granville talked, his subscribers listened.        


In early 1981, for instance, the Dow Jones industrial average dived 2.4 percent, on what was then the heaviest trading day in history, after Mr. Granville urged his newsletter followers to “sell everything and go short.” It rebounded in the following weeks before tumbling more than 20 percent over the next 15 months.        
Mr. Granville, who died on Sept. 7 at 90, was perhaps the most famous of a generation of market seers who made their own fortunes in the less risky venue of the newsletter business, in his case The Granville Market Letter, which he began publishing in 1963.        
“I’m paid to put you in at the bottom and take you out at the top,” he declared as he barnstormed the country with a showman’s flair, drumming up subscribers at investment seminars choreographed like Broadway shows.        
He once slid to the stage on a 100-foot-long wire wearing his standard After Six tuxedo. He used puppets and clown outfits. He often played a blues song on the piano with lyrics that underscored his contention that Wall Street brokerages were just out to make money off their customers.        
Mr. Granville wrote a daily market letter for E. F. Hutton & Company before striking out on his own. At its peak, in the early 1980s, his near-weekly newsletter had 13,000 subscribers. They paid $250 a year — and $500 more for urgent alerts by phone and Telex — as Mr. Granville sought to time the biggest gyrations in the markets.        
Louis R. Rukeyser, who often had Mr. Granville on his PBS program, “Wall Street Week,” told People magazine in 1981 that Mr. Granville was “the most controversial man in American finance.”        
But while Mr. Granville correctly called a bear market in the late 1970s and the implosion of technology stocks in 2000, he missed other major turns, like the start of an epic bull run in 1982.        
And like many other market forecasters, his overall performance was “very poor” compared with that of basic stock index funds, said Mark Hulbert, editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, which has tracked the performance of investment advisory newsletters since 1980.        
Mr. Hulbert said that from 1980 through January 2005, Mr. Granville’s stock tips for investors lost 0.5 percent on an annualized basis, compared with an 11.9 percent average yearly gain for a general stock index. Mr. Granville’s tips for more aggressive traders lost an average 10 percent a year over that period, Mr. Hulbert said.        
Mr. Granville, who continued to produce the newsletter until his death, did not provide enough trading details after January 2005 to track his performance as precisely. But he got enough of the broad turns in the market right, Mr. Hulbert said, that if investors had ignored his stock picks and bought or sold an index fund with each major call, they would have earned 8.5 percent a year since 1980.        
“He deserves some credit for insight into the market,” Mr. Hulbert said, adding that Mr. Granville created technical indicators still used by many market analysts.        
He died in a hospice in Kansas City, Mo., where he was being treated for pneumonia, his wife, Karen E. Granville, said.        
Mr. Granville reveled in all the attention his bold calls received, she said. “He loved that,” Mrs. Granville said in an interview. “It was almost like he was on stage all the time.”        
Joseph Ensign Granville was born on Aug. 20, 1923, in Yonkers. In “The Book of Granville: Reflections of a Stock Market Prophet,” published in 1984, Mr. Granville recalled that his father had lost $30,000 in the stock market crash of 1929 and “at least twice as much more that he borrowed from Grandma Buck and Auntie Blanche.”        
He wrote that his family survived only because his relatives “were comfortable enough to write off their losses and aid us in recovering.”        
Mr. Granville studied economics at Duke University and graduated in 1948. He also wrote books on bingo and investing in stamps. He was married three times.        
Beside his wife, the former Karen Erickson, whom he married in 1981, he is survived by six children from his second marriage, to the former Paulina Delp — John, Blanchard, Leslie, Leona Weissman, Mary Beth and Johanna — as well as 15 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

“An Appetite for Wonder” is only the first half of Richard Dawkins’s projected two-volume memoir about his life in science. With typical unsentimental pragmatism, he notes that “the companion volume should follow in two years — if I am not carried off by the unpredictable equivalent of a sneeze.” No one will ever accuse this highly opinionated ethologist and evolutionary biologist, whose books include “The Selfish Gene” and “The God Delusion,” of a rosy attitude.        


This first installment reads like the work of a man who has already written abundantly about himself. He often tells stories that, he acknowledges, he has told before. He includes the texts of speeches he has made. And he puts particular emphasis on the evolution — yes, he’d approve of that word — of “The Selfish Gene,” the 1976 genetics book that established his reputation (and put the word “meme” on the map).        
With the benefit of hindsight, and with a dearth of other compelling material, he wonders if “The Immortal Gene,” a title suggested to him by a London publisher, might have been better than the one he used. “I can’t now remember why I didn’t follow his advice,” he writes. “I think I should have done.”        
Anyone expecting an incisive account of Mr. Dawkins’s growth as a scientist may be surprised by the meandering path he takes here. True, his lineage is impressive, and his boyhood was uncommonly adventurous, so both warrant attention. He takes his time explaining that his great-great-great-grandparents eloped more cleverly than most couples do. Henry Dawkins and Augusta Clinton made their getaway in a coach, but not before the groom-to-be had planted half a dozen decoy coaches near Augusta’s home so that her father, Sir Henry Clinton, could not prevent the marriage. As the British commander in chief in America, he could not win the Revolutionary War, either.        
The family history also includes Clinton George Augustus Dawkins, son of the eloped couple, who earned his place in family lore during the Austrian bombardment of rebel Venice in 1849, when a cannonball hit his bed.        
“A cannonball penetrated the bed covers and passed between his legs, but happily did him no more than superficial damage,” reads the inscription that accompanies a cannonball in Mr. Dawkins’s possession. The story may not be 100 percent true, but it does underscore this family’s staying power.        
Mr. Dawkins’s forebears had scientific leanings of all kinds. Since many were posted to remote corners of the British Empire, those leanings are more exotic than most. One cousin wrote major books about the birds of Burma and Borneo. Other relatives held the post of chief conservator of the forests in India and Nepal. Another relative is credited with persuading Aldous Huxley to take mescaline and open the doors of perception. As Mr. Dawkins has already written in a brief and more obscure memoir: “For generations, sun-browned Dawkins legs have been striding in khaki shorts through the jungles of Empire.”        
He himself was born in 1941 in Nairobi, Kenya. Growing up in Nyasaland (now Malawi), he led what sounds like a charmed early life. This book includes a lovely, whimsical painting, made by his mother, illustrating the family’s idyllic-looking African life, which included a pet chameleon and a pet bush baby, a squirrel-size, big-eyed mammal. Mr. Dawkins recalls his father’s bedtime stories (“often featuring a ‘Broncosaurus,’ which said ‘Tiddly-widdly-widdly’ in a high falsetto voice”) and reading about Doctor Dolittle, whose love of animals made him one of the great fairy tale naturalists.        
But the tone turns sharper once this budding atheist is sent to a school where the pupils are compelled to say a good-night prayer. He says this was learned in “parrot fashion” and evolved into “garbled meaninglessness,” then adds tartly, “Quite an interesting test case in meme theory, if you happen to be interested in such things — if you are not, and don’t know what I’m talking about, skip to the next paragraph.” This is not a book that runs on charm.        
The second half of “An Appetite for Wonder” follows Mr. Dawkins back to England, and into an educational system that he harshly denounces. He writes about bullying, mortifying embarrassment, sadistic punishment and an absence of critical thinking, which, by his lights, is worst of all. He still bristles at having unimaginatively been called “a very inky little boy” when forced to have an open ink pot on his desk and keep dipping a pen into it.        
Mr. Dawkins’s memories briefly take him to Berkeley, Calif., where he lived long enough to protest American involvement in the Vietnam War. They finally arrive at Oxford, and to the beginning of his serious career in science. He presents detailed descriptions of some of his early experiments in animal behavior, like an analysis of newborn chicks’ pecking patterns.        
Then he moves on to what appeared to be his calling, computer science and the creation of computer language. He sought computer-based methods of analyzing hierarchical patterns in nature, and the specifics of such material, like his Mutual Replaceability Cluster Analysis Program, are not for amateurs. We’re a long way from the sun-browned little boy who caught butterflies.        
Mr. Dawkins treats the publication of “The Selfish Gene” as the dividing line between the first and second installments of this memoir. It’s a good place to pause, and it suggests strongly that the second volume will be heftier and more focused than this one. Mr. Dawkins’s memory for his work is much more vivid than his more personal stories. And the work has been far-ranging enough to support autobiographical study.        
But, for now, we have the kindling of Mr. Dawkins’s curiosity, the basis for his unconventionality and some very odd glimpses of professorial behavior. Mr. Dawkins describes one teacher who would begin by saying, “Oh, dear” and “I can’t hold it” and “I’m going to lose my temper,” before warning his students to hide under their desks. And then the ink pots flew.        
“He was a kind gentleman provoked beyond endurance — as who would not be in his profession?” writes Mr. Dawkins, himself no stranger to provocation. “Who would not be in mine?”

This week I discovered the best new performance space in New York. It isn’t in a downtown basement or a converted factory by the Gowanus Canal. It goes by a pretty banal name: Gallery 634.        


But when you walk in the door, you’ll know what I mean. To those familiar with the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s astonishing reinstallation of its European paintings collection, 634 is sacred space: the display of Dutch old masters assembled by the department store magnate Benjamin Altman.        
You probably can’t rent it for your next solo recital, but on Tuesday evening it was the site of a hearty concert by the early-music brass and wind ensemble Dark Horse Consort. The audience took in the program of 16th-century music from the Low Countries alongside the timeless faces hanging on the walls, both the somber ones painted by Rembrandt and Frans Hals’s grinning, red-faced partyers.        
Dark Horse’s performance, never better than in its rendition of Orlande de Lassus’s resplendent “Justorum animae,” was not the only occupation of a Met gallery on Tuesday. The evening was an occasion for the Grand Tour, perhaps the most perfect realization yet of the mission of Met Museum Presents, the institution’s revamped concert and lecture series.        
That mission is clear: tie the Met’s musical offerings to its exhibitions and collections.        
Well, the Grand Tour was nothing if not securely tied. In addition to the Dark Horse Consort, the event brought the vocal ensemble Tenet, the chamber ensemble Quicksilver and the harpsichordist Jory Vinikour, each to a different European gallery, to perform 20 minutes of music of the period reflected in the paintings.        
Ticket holders were divided into four groups, each on a different rotation through the cycle. Mine encountered Mr. Vinikour first, in one of the 18th-century French galleries.        
Here, too, the portraits seemed to stop and listen. The blushing young lady of Fragonard’s “Love Letter” turned from her correspondence to hear Mr. Vinikour’s gallant, flexibly phrased accounts of three movements by Louis Couperin. Couperin’s nephew, the great François, was represented by three extraordinary pieces: the rustic “Moissonneurs” (“Harvesters”); “Les Bergéries” (“The Sheepfold”), a pastoral twinkle, its melody immaculate in a thicket of ornaments; and “Les Barricades Mystérieuses” (“The Mysterious Barricades”), with a swing almost like pop music.        
Surrounded by 16th-century Venetian pictures by Veronese, Titian and others, Tenet, able to make soaring lines uncannily conversational, sang madrigals by Monteverdi, Luca Marenzio and Giaches de Wert. The group’s artistic director, the soprano Jolle Greenleaf, provided a luminous start in Marenzio’s “Quando sorge l’aurora” and a downward run of crystalline lucidity in Monteverdi’s “Dolcissimo uscignolo.”        
Quicksilver includes four of the finest early-music players in the city: the violinists Robert Mealy and Julie Andrijeski, the harpsichordist Avi Stein and the theorbo and guitar player Charles Weaver. The group’s performance amid Italian Baroque paintings featured little-heard sonatas by Dario Castello, Giovanni Battista Fontana and Johann Kaspar Kerll.        
These works turn on a dime: slow lines of aching lyricism tumble into joyous movement. I was facing Luca Giordano’s “Annunciation” as I listened, and I’d rarely seen that same mixture of lyricism and movement more clearly.

“No drama.” That’s how Jedediah Wheeler, the executive director of Peak Performances at Montclair State University in New Jersey, describes working with Liz Gerring, the on-the-rise choreographer he has chosen to open his fall series on Thursday. “Without drama” is how Ms. Gerring has described her own athletic, abstract dances. In both statements, the lack was meant as a positive.        


It has not always been so. Ms. Gerring, 48, has been making dances since the mid-1990s, but for the first 10 years she received almost no recognition. When critics did start paying attention, they wrote about ideas not coming to life. “Disturbingly bloodless” is how Jennifer Dunning characterized Ms. Gerring’s work in The New York Times in 2006, complaining that it was “only 42 minutes long, but 42 minutes has seldom passed so slowly.”        
What a change in 2010, when Alastair Macaulay reviewed Ms. Gerring’s “Lichtung/Clearing” as “a major achievement” and wrote in The Times about watching it with his heart in his mouth. He wasn’t the only critic to sense the opening of a new perspective, and the change wasn’t only in the view from the outside. Ms. Gerring herself felt that “Lichtung” had achieved a clarity missing from her earlier work, a communication of emotion and meaning through abstraction.        
“Lichtung,” performed in one of the Baryshnikov Arts Center’s black box theaters, attracted the notice of Mr. Wheeler. With its proscenium format and five times the seating capacity of Ms. Gerring’s usual spaces, the Montclair theater offers her the chance to reach a larger audience and the challenge of not losing her newfound clarity while scaling up. The title of the new work, at an hour her longest, is “Glacier.”        
Part of Mr. Wheeler’s strategy for helping Ms. Gerring manage the transition was a two-week residency in the theater in June. During a run-through, her commentary was almost reflexively sardonic. She laughed at her dance, mocked its seriousness. Later in the summer, talking over coffee, she treated her career similarly. Moments of drama were immediately undercut by small, mildly derisive voices coming out of the side of her mouth.        
But self-deprecation could not entirely disguise a long struggle. Ms. Gerring grew up in Sherman Oaks, Calif. — a few Valley Girl locutions still cling to her speech — and got into dance because she didn’t make the gymnastics team. At 13, she started ballet late, a devoted student never quite good enough to consider a career. When she was in 11th grade, her family moved to Seattle, where she channeled unhappiness into modern dance classes at the Cornish College of the Arts.        
Next came four tough years at Juilliard. The composition teacher Doris Rudko encouraged her, and in dancing works by Kazuko Hirabayashi she fell in love with abstraction, using the technique she excelled at without the acting that made her uncomfortable.        
After graduation she was at loose ends. Her boyfriend was a cyclist, so she became one. “I spent five years as this amateur racer,” she said, “staying at Super 8s with four of us in the room and doing these little races in Vermont in the rain.”        
“Well, that was a waste, I thought when I finished,” she added, but now she views that period as a stage of unlearning that became useful as she started over as a dancer, in a studio by herself, developing her own style. It’s easy to see the link to her athleticism — “I was trying to find same sense of pushing myself physically, as I had in cycling,” she said — but perhaps the unlearning after a solid dance education is connected to what Mr. Macaulay would praise, in 2011, as her dancers’ unschooled precision and her newly forged quality.        
For years Ms. Gerring’s choreographic career was sporadic, with time off for the births of her three children. Her productions fell beneath most reviewers’ radar, yet as soon as she began using bodies other than her own, she insisted upon dancers of first-class ability. Though her work is now often likened to Merce Cunningham’s and though she considers him a major influence, she has taken perhaps one class in Cunningham technique. Cunningham classes, though, are where she’s found many of her dancers.        
She also acknowledges the other influence that critics identify — that of the postmodernist Trisha Brown — and though Ms. Gerring never studied with her, the two became friends. It was Ms. Brown who helped Ms. Gerring weather that withering review in 2006.        
“That review forced me to take responsibility,” Ms. Gerring said. “I turned a page and started over again, but it was all those years that led to ‘Lichtung’ working out.”        
One continuity between Ms. Gerring’s early work, “Lichtung” and her new “Glacier” is the composer Michael J. Schumacher, whom she met at Juilliard. She usually choreographs before a score is written, often while improvising to other music, like pop. Yet the dance and the sound in her pieces aren’t entirely independent; there are sync points, cues, correspondences. “We’re not dancing to music,” she said, “but when it’s not there, it’s like we aren’t able to dance.”        
The music for “Glacier” came first, a composition Mr. Schumacher built from field recordings at Glacier Lake in Colorado. Ms. Gerring didn’t listen to that score while creating, but the natural sounds were in her mind. The choreography is more gestural than her recent work.        
“I’m trying to tell my tale a bit,” she said. “Maybe I have the confidence now not to have everyone onstage thrashing around. I tried to keep it stripped down for as long as I felt I could.”        
Recognizing Ms. Gerring’s attention to delicate relations between dancers, the designer Robert Wierzel has placed horizontal panels at the rear of the stage, using air and volume to focus attention on the cast. The panels are as blank as movie screens. All the drama is in the dancing.

Business,"












Walt Disney Studios on Wednesday announced a flurry of movie release date changes prompted by delays on “The Good Dinosaur” from Pixar, a movie originally scheduled to arrive in theaters in May.        
The upshot: For the first time in nine years, the Walt Disney Company will not release its annual Pixar movie.        
Pixar has been performing triage on “The Good Dinosaur” since removing its director last month. The film, about dinosaurs who become farmers, will now be released in November 2015.        
That sent a line of dominoes falling on Disney’s release schedule. “Maleficent,” a live-action film about the evil sorcerer from “Sleeping Beauty,” will move from July 2014 to May — the old “Good Dinosaur” date. And “Finding Dory” will move from November 2015 to June 2016.

Hair today, gone tomorrow? During the most recent New York Fashion Week, Justin Bieber showed up in the front row of several shows, including Opening Ceremony (below), with an unexpected accessory: a wispy smudge above his upper lip that sharp-eyed observers eventually identified as a mustache. A few days later, in an expression, perhaps, of boredom (or even defeat), the 19-year-old pop star had shaved off all trace of facial hair, returning to the baby-face visage that has a place of honor on the bedroom walls of preteen girls around the world. The dabbling with adulthood (like his earlier public barings of surprisingly well-defined pecs) did not go unnoticed on Twitter.

Who is Roberto Bolle? Indubitably, he is a handsome man, an exemplary ballet dancer. In his home country of Italy, he is a celebrity bordering on national hero. As a member of American Ballet Theater, he is a reliable leading man and a sterling partner. Since 2000 he has also been something of an impresario, organizing all-star performances under the title “Roberto Bolle and Friends.” On Tuesday at City Center, he showed one to New York.        


The gala evening, presented as part of the 2013 Year of Italian Culture in the United States, began with Mr. Bolle and the Mariinsky Ballet’s Alina Somova in a pas de deux from “Excelsior,” a landmark Italian extravaganza originally choreographed by Luigi Manzotti that hasn’t been seen in New York for a century. Performed without scenery — as were all but one of the program’s selections — the dance seemed unremarkable and not especially Italian, unless the exposure of Mr. Bolle’s leanly muscled physique counts.        
The duet could have been titled “Gala Pas de Deux.” There were nine of those on the program, followed by two solos. The monotony of format was leavened by a high ratio of choices unfamiliar to New York balletgoers. And even several of the more familiar items were welcome, particularly Herman Cornejo and Luciana Paris in Twyla Tharp’s “Sinatra Suite” and Mr. Cornejo and Maria Kochetkova in George Balanchine’s “Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux.”        
In several ways, Mr. Cornejo is Mr. Bolle’s opposite: small, explosive. It was a sign of Mr. Bolle’s modest generosity that he invited Mr. Cornejo, a dancer sure to outshine him in virtuosity and verve. (The other men, Jason Reilly of Stuttgart Ballet and Mikhail Kaniskin of Berlin State Ballet, were good but less contrastive.) Another sign, and the evening’s greatest merit, was Mr. Bolle’s inclusion of ballerinas rarely or never before seen in New York.        
Elisa Carrillo Cabrera, a Mexican-born dancer with Berlin State Ballet, brought a strikingly clean exactitude to Uwe Scholz’s generic “Jeunehomme” and some psychological complexity to Mauro Bigonzetti’s “Kazimir’s Colors.” Alicia Amatriain, a Spaniard with Stuttgart Ballet, was a chameleon: sweet and lovely in John Cranko’s choppy “Romeo and Juliet,” sexy and dangerous in Itzik Galili’s vulgar “Mono Lisa.”        
In between, in Christian Spuck’s “Le Grand Pas de Deux,” Ms. Amatriain revealed herself as a superb comedian, a distracted ballerina in glasses made dizzy by her fouetté turns. In that piece, a redeemingly funny sendup of ballet gala duets, Mr. Bolle played the straight man, a role to which he is suited.        
In Roland Petit’s “L’Arlésienne,” opposite the adorable, talented young Italian ballerina Erika Gaudenzi, Mr. Bolle’s character falls into a zombielike catatonia. This Mr. Bolle can do; the abandon of the piece’s mad scene is beyond his control. He’s so careful, you might almost call him a ballet machine. Remarkably, that’s what the program’s final work did.        
Through computer graphics, Massimiliano Volpini’s “Prototype” presents the manufacture of a ballet dancer: Mr. Bolle in the flesh. Video behind him points out the real perfection of his form. The background shifts to story-ballet scenes and multiplying video-game replications of the star. Is this how Mr. Bolle views himself? Is it a comment on his image? Who is this man?

MUMBAI, India — As this year’s monsoon season receded, onions were selling for an eye-popping 58 cents a pound, and inflation had accelerated to a six-month high. It has been a period of belt-tightening in India’s financial capital, a slow but sure blunting of hopes.        


But you would hardly have known that if you were standing under a 25-foot, gemstone-encrusted statue of the elephant-headed god Ganesh, who is believed to have the power to remove obstacles.        
The idol, necklaces cascading from its neck, was unloaded at the edge of the Arabian Sea on Wednesday to be submerged in the water alongside its brethren: the Ganesh laden with 145 pounds of gold ornaments; the Ganesh that was fitted with a new satin loincloth each day of the 10-day festival marking his birthday; the Ganesh lounging under strobe lights and crystal chandeliers, one plump foot resting on a gold-dusted globe.        
This year’s crop of Ganeshes — about 13,000 of them, according to the evening news — stood out for its gaudiness.        
Narendra Dahibawkar, who heads an umbrella organization overseeing the city’s idol-producing groups, said spending on this year’s Ganeshes was up 10 percent over 2012. The number of visitors during the festival had reportedly risen between 10 percent and 30 percent across the city, with five- and six-hour waits to make a wish. Mr. Dahibawkar said he thought the underlying reason was worry.        
“People are coming because they are insecure — about rising prices, about the way ladies are treated,” Mr. Dahibawkar said. “The government is not just to them. Only God.”        
At midafternoon, the idols began trundling past the graceful, derelict facades of Marine Drive, past the King of Kings Printers, to the edge of the sea. Prancing beside them were men and women dusted with vermilion powder, so they looked like red ghosts.        
Nikita Trevedi, 27, a pharmacist, watched dreamily as boys poled a raft heavy with idols out to the open sea and slid them below the surface of the water. It was a grander display than she had seen growing up in the 1980s.        
“Belief is growing,” she said happily. “It’s like going back in time.”        
The annual immersion of Ganesh became popular in the early 20th century as part of the Indian independence movement. It provided a way to bridge the gap between castes, and it served as a pretext for gathering without the interference of British forces.        
But in recent years, with corporate sponsors offering huge donations, Mumbai’s mandals — neighborhood organizations that sponsor and build idols — began a competition in grandiosity. City authorities had to set a 25-foot height limit, lest the idols slam into bridges and overpasses on their way to the ocean.        
Equally lavish are the offerings left for idols by wealthy devotees, typically out of gratitude that a wish has been fulfilled — a gold cradle, a gold soccer ball, a gold house. One year, a diamond-encrusted cellphone. In most cases, offerings to idols go to the mandal to be used for construction of the next year’s idol, though a portion is used to finance social programs.        
Social scientists have criticized lavish spending on temple rituals, arguing that a relatively small percentage of donations reach the truly needy.        
Nandini Sardesai, a sociology professor who grew up in Mumbai, said she had watched the gathering turn gradually from “private feast” into a public display of wealth that demands offerings from “people who can barely say where their next meal is coming from.”        
Still, the streets of Mumbai were thronged and joyful on Wednesday night, and many on the beach said the ritual offered a respite during uncertain times.        
Prakash Kumar, a pharmacy branch manager, said he had traveled almost 400 miles with his wife and baby to see an idol called Lalbaugcha Raja. With the arrival of Western culture in India, Mr. Kumar said, “physical things are more with us.” Events like Wednesday’s immersion, he said, offered him some freedom from the relentless pressure to earn.        
“Everyone is looking for peace now,” he said.        
Atam Mukhaya, 53, who works at a metal factory, said he would wish to be free from financial anxiety. “The government doesn’t care about the common man,” he said. “Onions cost 80 rupees a kilogram. How can I afford a good meal? Even God can’t do anything about it.”        
A Popsicle in his hand was dripping in the heat, and he glared at it. “All he can do is give me ice cream,” he said.        
Dinesh Sundakar, 44, sat with his family as they burned incense in a brass dish. He looked sour. His embroidery business had lost four big clients, he said, and he had spent the last year idle.        
“Ganesh doesn’t sort anything out for you, in my personal experience,” he said. “Last year, I didn’t bring an idol, and I had a good job. This year, I brought an idol and I am unemployed.” A relative intervened, pointing out that he had had too much to drink to draw such conclusions, but Mr. Sundakar went on.        
“I don’t like Ganesh,” he said. “Maybe it’s random chance. But I think he is bad luck for me.”

Nets point guard Deron Williams sprained his right ankle and bruised a bone while working out in Utah, the team said Wednesday, hardly the kind of news the Nets wanted to announce with the start of training camp on Oct. 1.        
The 29-year-old Williams, who suffered with ankle problems last season, is now in a walking boot, the team said, but is expected to be ready to participate when training camp begins at Duke University.        
Or at least the Nets hope he will be. Last season, ankle problems definitely impacted Williams’s performance on the court. “I can’t dunk, I can’t jump,” he said at one point.        
He had a series of cortisone shots to address his ankle issues, as well as plasma therapy, and he did play significantly better in the latter part of the season, when he more closely resembled the point guard considered one of the best in the league. Over all, he averaged 18.9 points and 7.7 assists in 78 games.

When the costume designer Mandi Line was interviewing for a job on the ABC Family show “Pretty Little Liars,” she had a case to make. “I said, “If you let me make fashion the fifth character on this show, people will watch it just for the clothes,’ ” she said.        


Ms. Line was hired, and the characters’ signature looks — stripes, leather jackets, trench coats — have been the subject of much discussion ever since, with blogs devoted to what the characters wear. “Every single day I get tweets, Facebook messages and Instagrams from girls who line up their clothes next to photos of the characters,” said Ms. Line, who also believes that “Pretty Little Liars” is influencing retail. “I have seen feather earrings and black-and-white-stripe dresses in stores.”        
But Ms. Line has bigger ambitions than just glimpsing her influence while shopping. “I’m a Leo, I’m 6 feet tall, I love being in front of the camera,” she said. “I’m a vegan and do charity work and mentor kids. I am destined for something.”        
“Ultimately, I want to do a fitness line,” she said. “I want a book and a show.”        
Years ago, if costume designers were known at all, they worked in movies. Think of studio powerhouses like Adrian, who worked on MGM productions like “The Wizard of Oz” and “The Philadelphia Story,” or Edith Head, of Paramount and later Universal, who designed costumes for Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn.        
Today, even successful movie costume designers like Catherine Martin, who did the designs for “The Great Gatsby,” and Trish Summerville who is doing the next “Hunger Games” movie and will sell a line, Capitol Couture by Trish Summerville, on Net-a-Porter, don’t exactly cut outsize figures.        
But as television has gained more respect as a medium, there has been a coattail effect on some of its costume designers, who say that their work there gives them greater opportunity than current cinema to influence the culture at large.        
“The movie genres popular right now have to do with designing vampires and superheroes,” said Rebecca Hofherr, the costume designer for “Elementary” on CBS. “TV deals with more realistic issues and more realistic clothing.”        
And some, like Janie Bryant of “Mad Men” on AMC, whose revival of midcentury styles is now a frequent reference on high-fashion runways, are practically becoming brands unto themselves.        
Over the last three years Ms. Bryant, who is writing a book and developing a reality-TV competition with the working title “Janie Bryant’s Hollywood,” has struck deals with Maidenform, Hearts on Fire Diamonds (for which she is also a model), Banana Republic and Cosmopolitan Russia. When Ms. Bryant designed a suit for Brooks Brothers based on Don Draper’s look, it sold out of all stores and the Web within 10 days, said Arthur Wayne, the vice president for global public relations for the store, adding, “These types of collaborations help the consumers think of us differently.”        
Thanks to a new division at the Matchbook Company, an agency in a town house on a leafy block of Murray Hill that is currently managing the careers of Ms. Bryant and Ms. Line, consumers may also soon be thinking of television costume designers differently.        
“We want the public to recognize them as people, not just behind the scenes,” said Linda Kearns, the vice president for brand development at Matchbook, which also represents the costume designers Tom Broecker (House of Cards”), Dan Lawson (“The Good Wife”), Jenn Rogien (“Girls,” “Orange Is the New Black”) and Lyn Paolo (“Shameless,” “Scandal,”), as well as athletes, models and speakers. “We are focusing on the TV designers because there’s a bigger attachment when the characters of the show enter your home and life each week.”        
Although she would like to represent the designers for the shows “Downton Abbey” and “Nashville,” Ms. Kearns said she has turned down plenty of potential clients.        
She met Ms. Bryant after Ms. Kearns’s business partner, Kristi McCormick, booked her for an appearance at Nordstrom in Seattle, sponsored by Joseph Abboud, offering style tips to men. “I just had this sense she could be so much more,” Ms. Kearns said.        
Ms. Bryant pointed out that her field amounts to a comprehensive course in clothing design. “It’s so vast and so varied,” she said while attending New York Fashion Week with Ms. Paolo. “It’s not only limited to women’s wear, it’s men’s wear, children, all socioeconomic backgrounds, all different bodies.”        
Television has certainly had its share of memorable fashion moments, from Mary Ann’s red-and-white gingham dress to Bill Cosby’s sweaters. But few of its designers are widely remembered, other than the late Nolan Miller, for “Dynasty,” and Patricia Field, for “Sex and the City.”        
“The buzz started towards the end of the first season, and by the beginning of the second, it just exploded,” Ms. Field said of the latter show, on HBO. “It was like sitting at the bottom of an atom bomb.”        
Her mix of high and low price points, designer and street wear, was new on screen, and “Sex and the City” was credited with starting crazes for nameplate necklaces, Manolo Blahnik shoes, flower corsages and visible bra straps. Ms. Field designed collections for Payless Shoes and HSN and was approached to do a reality show (she also recently worked on costumes for “The Other Woman,” a movie starring Cameron Diaz). “It was a lot of fun to be acknowledged, actually,” she said. “I was recognized on the street.”        
Eric Daman, who did work for “Sex and the City” and went on to the CW show “Gossip Girl,” said that by the latter show’s sixth season, it was “getting one-of-a-kind couture from Paris.”        
“They wanted their wares on Blake Lively,” he said.

When the ambitious refurbishing of the landmark Park Avenue Armory is complete, New York will have an alternative arts center unlike any in the world: a national treasure that carefully weaves together historical and new design while encompassing industrial austerity and Belle Époque excess.        


The arduous transformation involves the totality of the armory’s immense, celebrated structure, which was built from 1877 to 1881 by the Seventh National Guard Regiment, the state’s wealthiest and most blue-blooded; it sometimes functioned a bit as an upper-class men’s club.        
Architecturally, it was, and remains, a fabulously hybrid creation: its baronial Head House looms over Park Avenue between 66th and 67th Streets; behind it lies the soaring, stripped-down industrial shed of the Wade Thompson Drill Hall. The hall’s 55,000 column-free square feet seem tailor-made for oversize works of performance and installation art — impossible for any other institution in the city to accommodate.        
Performances began mere months after the nonprofit Park Avenue Conservancy, led by Rebecca Robertson, its president and executive producer, signed a 99-year lease with the state late in 2006 to restore the building and operate it as an arts center, and have continued, nearly uninterrupted, throughout the renovation.        
The armory restoration, budgeted at $200 million, with $120 million spent, is being led by the innovative Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of Herzog & de Meuron, best known for converting a sprawling London power station into the Tate Modern. They and their team have been either studying or working on the building for seven years, and plans call for a 2018 completion. It is not easy to turn a grand but crumbling pile that descended to the World Monuments Fund’s list of the world’s 100 most endangered structures in 2000, into a fully functioning cultural entity that also reveals a good bit of its own physical history.        
The nature — and fruits — of the carefully devised renovation process will become much more apparent on Sept. 29, with the inauguration of the armory’s newly restored Board of Officers Room as an intimate hall for music and dance recitals, plays and performance art.        
It is one of the 18 rooms in the Head House, and their renovation is especially complicated. Commissioned by either the regiment or its individual companies, they were done to a fare-thee-well of Gilded Age sumptuousness by the leading interior decorators and furniture makers of the day: Louis Comfort Tiffany, Stanford White, Pottier & Stymus and the Herter Brothers.        
Over the decades, they were repeatedly redone and updated as styles changed or new technologies (like electricity) arrived. Walls were repainted, ceilings redecorated, new floors laid. Paneling was added or changed.        
The current restoration is being overseen by Ascan Mergenthaler, a Herzog & de Meuron partner, in concert with the New York architect Charles Platt, of Platt Bayard Dovell White Architects; the Conservancy staff; and an extensive team of restorers and skilled artisans. Until now, the improvements have been elaborate yet largely invisible upgrades to the Drill Hall, including air-conditioning, new windows, increased electrical power and reinforced structural support.        
The Board of Officers Room was created by Herter Brothers, among the great design firms of the late-19th-century American Aesthetic Movement. Its reopening, with a recital by the baritone Christian Gerhaher, accompanied on the piano by Gerold Huber, will be something of milestone: It will bring the restoration process more fully into public view, illuminating a preservation philosophy that accepts flaws, embraces signs of age and focuses more on subtractions than additions, all of which must be visible as such.        
The imposing Officers Room, most recently used primarily as a coat check room, has been returned to something remarkably close to its original glory, but not quite. It doesn’t hurt the cause that this chamber is one of the few surviving Herter interiors, showing the firm’s work at its most original, and that it is, with the Silver Room at the far end of the broad first floor hall — designed by Tiffany and restored in the 1980s — probably the most important and stunning interior in the Head House. It also has an austerity that falls somewhere between the starkness of the Drill Hall and the other busier Head House rooms.        
Its walls and ceilings are decorated with different patterns stenciled onto solid backgrounds — an economical imitation of wallpaper used throughout the Head House — that have been scrupulously cleaned and repaired. Its rich mahogany wainscoting, pocket doors and monumental fireplace, relieved of layers of grime and varnish, once again exude a startlingly bright shade of lustrous red. R. Mark Adams, a Herter specialist who is in charge of the meticulous restoration of the armory’s miles of woodwork, said that the shade might be unique in the Herter oeuvre and that it was achieved using madder root.          
The main approach in the Head House is a process that Mr. Herzog and Mr. de Meuron call “delayering.” This means the removal of subsequent alterations and additions where possible, figuring out what was done and when, how much of the original decorations lurk beneath more recent layers and which treatment along a given room’s timeline should be emphasized.

ON A DAMP AFTERNOON in the second-tier dressing room of the new Badgley Mischka boutique, I happened upon a clear cellophane packet containing perhaps the most brilliant retail innovation since the escalator: the Disposable Fashion Mask. Manufactured by a company called True Fit Try On, which also does a brisk business in “hygienic liners” for bathing suits, this translucent mask, sort of a Ped for the face, with holes only for the eyes, enables the wearer to try on expensive clothing without worrying that her makeup will soil the neckline.        


It also lends even the most conventional of garments a transgressive “Bring Out the Gimp” frisson, surely unanticipated by Messrs. Badgley (Mark) and Mischka (James): Parsons graduates, partners in work and life and reliable purveyors of ye olde Hollywood glamour since 1988. In this period they have expanded from frocks into shoes, bathing suits, coats, jewelry and glasses, all tastefully spangled, never screeching into Dolly Parton territory.        
I think of these guys as the genial Emperors of Embellishment, riding out several boom-and-bust cycles, not to mention waves of minimalism, with their bottomless sacks of sequins and bugle beads.        
But they have never before had a store in Manhattan, perhaps because even in the best of economic times the city’s jittery energy is more hospitable to the avant-garde than the “timeless.” A resident is just as likely to express status wearing shredded-neck Yohji Yamamoto that makes her look like Kermit the Frog in mourning as with basic signifiers like satin and sparkle.        
Badgley Mischka, however, steadfastly refuses to compromise the Southern-belle aesthetic that has made the label a mainstay of red carpets, bridal aisles and charity benefits. The tone is set at the entrance with a large chandelier dripping with crystals. The floors are reclaimed wood: white and lightly battered. The rooms are unnervingly spacious. And the help is unfailingly gracious.        
On my first visit, searching for a nice formal to wear to the Emmys rather than my typical vintage freak show, I was quizzed about budget by Marcus, a clerk on loan from the Beverly Hills store, and shunted quickly to the “collection” area, where there’s a small selection of gowns straight from the MGM playbook.        
A single-strapped number with goddess draping ($740, less on eBay) recalled the one in that famous publicity still from “The Killers” with Ava Gardner posing on a table under a hanging lamp. In the movie, she wears it at a party while singing “The More I Know of Love,” and Burt Lancaster’s character is immediately a goner. Or, as his date says in resigned voice-over, “Right then I knew the boat had sailed, and I just got my things and went home.”        
The only color in stock was purple, though, which made me look less like Ava in her prime than an uncooked late-summer eggplant.        
“We can order it in sapphire,” Marcus assured, futzing with the bodice. “We can take it in here, and here, and” — giving my chassis a quick once-over — “Spanx. God’s gift to man. To woman!”        
I was curious about the room on the far end of the store where the four-figure “couture” frocks are kept, their spirits doubtless freshened by a view of a lovely garden, but Marcus waved me away with a well-meaning “don’t even go there” sort of motion. (There is also a V.I.P. room upstairs; bridal is subterranean, swallowing a parade of modern Persephones.)        
I went there again with a vengeance last Saturday, when the place was deserted, probably because it was Yom Kippur. Joan Rivers, a congregant at Temple Emanu-El a block away, caused a great ruckus when she swanned through Badgley Mischka’s fall show last year, and I imagined the Fashion Police would have no problems with the silver-and-gold strapless “mermaid deco” ball gown ($6,875) into which I was ever so cautiously ushered by a pair of saleswomen, Norvys and Angeline. Why was I swimming in a size two smaller than my usual? “That’s couture!” Norvys said with a twinkle. I gathered that when you are paying as much as a used car for a dress, a little ego-stroking is part of the deal. Any bourgeois concept of privacy also flies out the window.        
“And here are the boobies,” Angeline said, hustling inside the (first-tier, plush-carpeted) dressing room with a pair of foam bust boosters known in the industry as “chicken cutlets,” and plunging her hands into the corset area with the enthusiasm of a teenage boy.        
“When you get dressed for the evening, you shouldn’t have to work hard for it,” Mr. Badgley told People magazine in 1996. If I had invested in Apple stock then, I might have been able to spring for the next dress I tried, a backless Geoffrey Beene-esque gray flannel column with rhinestones at the collar and bobbing down the back of the neck ($4,495), obviating the need for a Harry Winston loaner. Instead I just got my things and went home.

LYON, France — The buzz around Benjamin Millepied’s L.A. Dance Project is undoubtedly fueled by an aura of glamour that emanates from Mr. Millepied — former New York City Ballet principal, future artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet, sought-after choreographer and husband of Natalie Portman. Only one year old, the L.A. Dance Project has already found international success, and on Tuesday night the troupe opened the Maison de la Danse’s season, filling every one of its 1,160 seats.        


No one could accuse Mr. Millepied of coasting. As well as a recent piece of his own, there were premieres from the City Ballet dancer Justin Peck and by the Israeli choreographer Emanuel Gat. It was a riveting, rich evening of dance, tightly packed with a range of movement styles and influences, superbly performed by the small ensemble: Aaron Carr, Julia Eichten, Charlie Hodges, Morgan Lugo, Nathan Makolandra and Rachelle Rafailedes.        
Mr. Peck has made three much-praised works for his home company in the last two years; a fourth will have its premiere on Thursday night at City Ballet’s fall gala at Lincoln Center. (As will a work by Mr. Millepied.) You don’t want to think about Mr. Peck’s travel schedule.        
“Murder Ballads,” set to a quirky score of the same name by Bryce Dessner, shows what the fuss is about. It is Mr. Peck’s first piece for a contemporary dance ensemble, and he makes this immediately explicit as the curtain rises on a stage dotted by sneakers. Ms. Eichten runs on first and dons her pair, quickly followed by five more dancers in casual, bright clothes.        
The mood is insouciant, recalling Jerome Robbins ballets like “Interplay” and “Moves.” Later there are echoes of “West Side Story” in the simultaneously approaching and retreating lines with which Mr. Peck ends the third section, and reminders of Robbins’s “Dances at a Gathering” in the way social groups form, occasionally excluding, then reabsorbing, a lone figure. There are other influences too: William Forsythe in the counterbalanced weighting of the partnering; even Pina Bausch, in a cumulatively urgent, thrilling series of solos toward the end.        
But Mr. Peck’s own voice emerges clearly in his gift for structure and patterning, in the dynamic contrasts of the movement and in his ability to surprise, both choreographically and psychologically. In the first minutes of the piece, dancers surround an immobile woman, their palms held up to (but not touching) her body, as a man walks away, lights darken and a siren wails. (Murder?) A later pas de deux ends with a man dropping his prone partner’s hand as the lights fade. These moments of drama and inexplicable emotional currents are mere hints; Mr. Peck has the great gift of knowing how to subtract.        
Mr. Gat’s “Morgan’s Last Chug” is a far less resolved work, but it has its own gloomy allure, a darker European nature set against the brighter American vision of Mr. Peck’s piece. The dance unfolds independently, in flurries of rapid, dislocated gestures, against an aural backdrop of recordings of Purcell’s march from “Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary,” Glenn Gould playing Bach’s “Suite Française” and Jim Norton in Beckett’s “Krapp’s Last Tape.” The structure of the work often feels arbitrary, but Mr. Gat’s compositional layerings of bodies in space, their apparently accidental refractions, remain in the mind’s eye.        
So does Mr. Millepied’s “Reflections,” with its eye-popping white-letters-on-red-backdrop (“stay” and, later, “go”) by Barbara Kruger in the artist’s signature graphic style. On the floor, in the same color scheme, is written: “thinking of you thinking of me.” Against this, five dancers wearing gray-toned, simple costumes perform a series of duets, solos and trios to a wide-ranging piano score (minimalist, atonal, melodic in turn) by David Lang. The movement is fleet and fluid, reminiscent of Mr. Forsythe’s “Quintett” in the way it both skims the floor yet is weighted by gravity.        
Two duets, one adagio, one allegro, for Ms. Rafailedes and Mr. Makolandra, are full of movement invention and beautifully danced; more conventional but perfectly detailed is a sparkling balletic solo for the extraordinary Mr. Hodges, who later moves alongside Mr. Lugo, both low to the ground, in a duo of catlike stealth.        
“Reflections,” created in May, is long (38 minutes) and can feel slightly desultory at moments. But what we see, hearteningly, in this and the other works on the program, are men and women in complex, adult encounters. There is no central male-female pas de deux, that structural fallback of every neo-Classical ballet. Life, these choreographers suggest, is more complicated and interesting than that.

When the nine-time Emmy nominee and widely acknowledged dreamboat Jon Hamm sails down the red carpet on Sunday, chances are you will notice his date’s dress, makeup and hairstyle more than the particulars of his appearance.        


But Mr. Hamm will have had his hair carefully styled to look looser than the tightly combed businessman’s coif for which he’s known on “Mad Men.”        
“I work with Jon when he’s Jon Hamm,” said his groomer, Diana Schmidtke. “I don’t work with Don Draper. So for me it’s always about making him not look too Don Draper. Almost like he just ran his fingers through his hair. Very natural.”        
Though some men, famous or not, have been boldly stepping out with “guyliner” and nail polish, we are not quite at the point where Hollywood makeup artists are taking credit for it as they do with women.        
Ms. Schmidtke, 38, is one of a handful of male celebrity groomers there, a term little heard of 15 years ago (when, she said, photographers would ask her, “What is that, like dog grooming?”) but increasingly bandied about in a world of high-definition cameras and metrosexuality. She has tended to the floppy forelocks and five o’clock shadows of not just Mr. Hamm but Clint Eastwood, George Clooney, Jimmy Fallon, Viggo Mortensen and Chris Hemsworth, making sure they look like the best versions of themselves for magazine covers, press junkets and award shows.        
This summer, Ms. Schmidtke was in New Mexico, working on her first film, the comedy “A Million Ways to Die in the West,” directed by and starring Seth MacFarlane, whom she started working with two years ago and groomed for the Academy Awards in February.        
Reviews of Mr. MacFarlane’s Oscars hosting stint were mixed, but thanks to the Peter Thomas Roth anti-shine gel Ms. Schmidtke smeared on his T-zone, no one could say he was shiny. On a typical celebrity booking, Ms. Schmidtke starts with an old-fashioned barber shave. Next come the eyebrows, a potential minefield. “The quickest way to feminize a man’s face is to over-groom the eyebrow,” she said. “You can do above the brow, but when you start to take too much underneath or create any type of arch, boom, he starts to look like a girl.” She prefers plucking the brow to waxing, which she said removes too much, and also uses tweezers to tackle stray nose and ear hairs.        
Then she applies concealer (no Pan-Cake, please!) and mattifying lotion — more guy-friendly than powder puffs, she said — as needed.        
In fact, Ms. Schmidtke is sensitive to all sorts of macho preferences. For example, she’ll boil down beauty lingo into action words. “Pre-shave oil” may not register with guys, but “if you say it helps the glide of the blade, ding ding ding, they understand what it means,” she said.        
Within the industry, Ms. Schmidtke is praised as much for her demeanor as for any specific ministrations. “I always trust that Diana will make my clients looks and feel their best,” said Robin Baum, a Hollywood publicist who has worked with Mr. Hemsworth, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and James Franco. “She has great energy.”        
The photographer Mark Seliger, who has worked with Ms. Schmidtke for 14 years on shoots for Mr. MacFarlane, Will Ferrell and others, praised Ms. Schmidtke’s “fun and positivity.”        
But the groomer characterized her rapport with A-list actors another way: “I’m a little crass at times,” she said.        
Ms. Schmidtke became interested in hairdressing after modeling for Nexxus at age 16, attended Pivot Point beauty school in Chicago and moved west in 1997, working for a pricey Beverly Hills salon. “I wasn’t used to that type of clientele,” she said. “Everything was so shiny and new, the beautiful people and the cars. I failed.”        
But an apprenticeship with Marvin Lynch, then a successful hairstylist, led to representation by the Celestine Agency (she has since moved to the Wall Group), which booked her on music shoots.        
“I had every intention to do girl hair, but it just wouldn’t click with actresses,” Ms. Schmidtke said.        
In 1999, after an assigned groomer didn’t show, she was pulled into a shoot with David Boreanaz of “Angel.” In thanks for the favor, Mr. Boreanaz’s publicist next called on Ms. Schmidtke to groom Chris Klein for his “American Pie” press tour.        
“Then all the mayhem started,” she said. “I loved it. I was young and my job was making hot guys hotter.”        
She studied the history of shaving and stays current by reading men’s fashion and grooming blogs. Though Ms. Schmidtke’s work sometimes involves the more traditional process of putting a client into character, as she did with Mr. Clooney for a Cary Grant-style Vanity Fair shoot, she also enjoys watching the application of television trends to real life (the “Boardwalk Empire,” shaved close with an undercut while leaving a floppy 4 to 5 inches on top, was popular this summer, she said).        
And while her work revolves around famous faces, Ms. Schmidtke is pleased to see companies making more grooming solutions for everyday Joes. (One of her career high points, she said, was in 2009 when she made over husbands on “The Oprah Winfrey Show.”)        
But getting a man, even one who banks on his image, to change his regimen is almost always an uphill battle, Ms. Schmidtke said. “With guys, you have to keep it simple.”

The New York City Ballet production of “Swan Lake,” shaped by the company’s artistic director, Peter Martins, in the 1990s, is no simple experience. Especially as performed on Tuesday, it keeps tugging its audience in different directions. The designs by Per Kirkeby turn it into a pencil cartoon sketch of “The ‘Swan Lake’ Show” that’s then been daubed by a paint-by-numbers beginners’ class: the prince is all blue, the villagers are green, the jester orange and so on. Tchaikovsky’s tempos are taken at a terrific lick: no Romantic lingerings here. Often the music — Andrews Sill conducted the company’s orchestra on Tuesday — rushes past without deepening the action; yet in some central passages we’re swept urgently into its vortex.        


The secondary characters are tiresome. Queen Victoria complained of Gladstone, as prime minister, “He speaks to me as if I were a public meeting”; here, however, the Queen (Gwyneth Muller on Tuesday) in vast mime gestures that suggests she thinks he is a very public meeting indeed. The Jester (Daniel Ulbricht), though a prodigy of speed, is completely unfunny. The evil sorcerer von Rotbart (Silas Farley), who controls the enchanted swan-maidens and their queen, Odette, is an absurd caricature devil; the lining of his cloak — the brightest fabric of the whole show — is hell-flame orange.        
The dancing falls into two main categories — brisk, efficient but flippantly inconsequential or brisk, impetuous, eloquent and compelling. Fortunately, Sara Mearns is rivetingly immediate as both the heroine Odette and the look-alike antiheroine Odile. She dances the role as if living the story for the first time, and, as she burns her way through it, you can’t take your eyes off her. As each phrase of her music arrives, she’s already there on top of it — as if it illustrates her rather than the reverse. In the first lakeside scene, the corps of swan-maidens dances that way too: firm and highly three-dimensional.        
While Jared Angle, as Prince Siegfried, dances in a simpler style, it’s elegant and full. The carriage of his head, the focus of his address to other characters, the firmness of his phrasing all give the drama real seriousness; and he’s a superb partner.        
But when Erica Pereira, Brittany Pollack and Anthony Huxley rattle their way nimbly through the steps of the Act I pas de trois (an over-embellished version of Marius Petipa’s 1895 St. Petersburg version), and when Megan Fairchild, Tiler Peck, Abi Stafford and Joaquin de Luz prattle through the top-speed nonsense of Mr. Martins’s Act II palace pas de quatre, it’s like hearing Gilbert & Sullivan patter songs without the humor. Only Mr. Huxley and, especially, Mr. de Luz manage to retain elegance; the women are made to look accomplished and silly at the same time. The waste of the phenomenal Ms. Peck in this taxing but trifling role is especially disgraceful; yet hers is merely the worst case of Mr. Martins’s fondness for trivializing women with obstacle-course choreography.        
Thus aspects of the “Swan Lake” story are turned inside-out. In the traditional version, the still part-adolescent Siegfried rebels against the constrictions of grown-up court decorum; here Mr. Angle seems the only reasonable and three-dimensional adult onstage until he meets Ms. Mearns by the lakeside. Back in the palace, his dreadful mother tries to fob him off with a choice of six uniformly vapid but pushy princesses; when Ms. Mearns turns up, this time in a black tutu, his attraction to her seems entirely a meeting of serious minds amid a gathering of ninnies.        
This really isn’t the fault of any dancer. City Ballet’s performers on Tuesday made the best case for this problematic production that I’ve experienced; their alertness of rhythm was a special pleasure. But most of what they’re dancing is Martins choreography, which squanders them. When the women of the first court scene extend arms and one leg behind them in arabesque, the image has no linear point.        
Then, when Ms. Mearns dances — most of her choreography is by Petipa, Lev Ivanov and George Balanchine — the line of each outstretched limb knows precisely which star in the firmament it will reach. Simply, inevitably, her dancing shows us the full amplitude of ballet; and the art form again becomes something of great consequence. In the palace ballroom it was good to see a few dancers — notably the ever-improving Savannah Lowery in the Hungarian Dance — bring real force to their material.        
As the heartbroken Odette in the final scene, Ms. Mearns even reveals value in Mr. Martins’s choreography. The vulnerability with which she returns to folded-over swan imagery, as if returning to her nest, and the tragic poignancy with which she invests each phrase are both superb.        
Still, Mr. Martins wrecks the start of this scene by giving us irrelevant pranks by the Jester. And in the conclusion, Odette and Siegfried defeat von Rotbart without themselves meeting death. But then Odette still withdraws forever from Siegfried because he broke his vow to her. Perhaps Balanchine might have brought this off; but he would have done so with a piercing image of dance-drama. The astounding end of his “Divertimento From ‘Le Baiser de la Fée’ ” comes to mind. Mr. Martins, instead, reverts to mere Romantic-ballet formula, with the corps screening Odette’s exit and barring Siegfried’s effort to pursue her.        
That isn’t this production’s only lame episode. The palace scene features a foolish dance (to the start of this ballet’s mazurka) while Siegfried plots his betrothal to the wrong heroine, Odile; then, clumsily, the score cuts to the last section of Tchaikovsky’s action music.        
Is it just stubbornness that makes Mr. Martins keep reviving his “Swan Lake” without trying to improve its more obviously weak patches? He knows well how Balanchine went on reworking ballets. And Mr. Martins’s dogged persistence in making no changes to flawed productions keeps his whole company in a state of perpetually interrupted development.

In the basement of Galerie Perrotin, a powerhouse gallery from Paris that opened in New York on Tuesday night, a dollar bill shot out of a towering blue box and drifted onto a floor littered with bills and coins. A sign explained the work by Paola Pivi, an Italian artist: “Caution: Money is spit out everywhere.”        


It seemed appropriate given today’s art market, not to mention the throngs of well-heeled collectors who came to inspect the city’s newest mega-luxe gallery, which occupies the lower floors of a landmark building at the corner of East 73rd Street and Madison Avenue.        
“The whole neighborhood is a money machine,” said Ingrid Sischy, the Vanity Fair contributor.        
Art world wheeler-dealers like Peter Brant, Simon de Pury, Jeffrey Deitch, Mike Ovitz, Beth Rudin DeWoody and Knight Landesman mingled on the first floor, under Ms. Pivi’s life-size garishly colorful polar bear sculptures. They were joined by a notably younger crew, artists like KAWS, J.R. and Max Snow, as well as the fashion designers Olivier Theyskens, Carly Cushnie and Michelle Ochs.        
“The art world is the new music world,” said Swizz Beatz, the musician and artist, who wore sunglasses and a black T-shirt by YSL. He greeted Pharrell Williams, the writer of the summer’s two biggest dance hits, “Get Lucky” by Daft Punk and “Blurred Lines” by Robin Thicke.        
“The art world is always super inspiring,” said Mr. Williams, who also makes sculptures. “All these super creative kinds know how to take it to the next level.”        
For Emmanuel Perrotin, the young gallerist and circus master of the evening, the next level meant over the top. For the post-opening dinner and after-party, he took over all four floors of the Russian Tea Room for a 1,000-person party that would make a New York power bar mitzvah look modest. Dinner (Lobster and caviar canapés, anyone?) was served on the first two floors, music and dancing on the third. And on the fourth? A carnival, with games and prizes that only art insiders could appreciate.        
“Our collectors are in the center of the art world, and you always have to surprise them,” said Mr. Perrotin, who wore a glittery Lanvin blazer, as he made sure the Ruinart Champagne kept flowing. “People need pleasure.”        
Clutching cartons of popcorn and jabbing with the sharp elbows of the entitled, guests threw balls to win miniature sculptures by KAWS, tossed rings to win plaster facsimiles of gadgets by Daniel Arsham and used metal claws to grab plushy toys by Takashi Murakami.        
With the greedy eyes of speculators at auctions, they screamed and cheered for artist-made tattoos, photos of themselves and a Damien Hirst spin-art booth.        
Never mind that it was an event that seemed more appropriate for underprivileged children than overprivileged adults.        
“If it’s not fun in this town, why get out of bed?” said RoseLee Goldberg, the founder of Performa, the performance art organization.        
Only for a deal, a buck or some swag, it would seem.

Two years ago the Swedish D.J., producer and denim model Avicii released “Levels,” a clangorous and joyful club anthem that was a global hit so vast that it reinforced the fact that the United States isn’t really the center of global pop, at least not the way it once was.        


America has no real radio infrastructure for dance music, which means even a song like “Levels” has little hope of moving beyond the Electric Daisy Carnival circuit and into the broader pop consciousness, although everywhere else that’s exactly where it resided. At least in this country, American sonic imperialism still works.        
But a lot has changed since “Levels.” Dance music is becoming normalized, even here, and has been seeping into other genres, from traditional pop to R&B. D.J.-producers like Calvin Harris, by working with superstars like Rihanna, are beginning to gain a dollop of the respect they garner elsewhere.        
Into that environment arrives Avicii’s full-length debut album, “True” (PRMD/Island), which, thanks to the success of “Levels,” has the whiff of a fait accompli about it. At least it did until the Ultra Music Festival in March, when Avicii turned his high-profile set into a roots jam session, to the befuddlement of almost everyone, and the outright anger of many. I’m sure someone would have screamed “Judas!” if they’d gotten the joke.        
“Hey, you got your bluegrass in my techno!” is a perfectly valid complaint most of the time. And yes, on a few songs on “True,” with the help of the bluegrass stalwart Dan Tyminski and the longtime country songwriter Mac Davis, that is more or less what Avicii attempts.        
But don’t see “True” as the album in which dance music imports the sounds of the American heartland into the club in hopes of digging up new audiences, or even new ideas; see it as the one in which country takes its place front and center in global pop.        
That is the subtext of the guitar-laden stomper “Wake Me Up,” already another huge hit that undermines American centrality in global pop, and especially the unexpectedly lovely “Hey Brother,” which features the keening vocals of Mr. Tyminski. (How much of a risk is it to use the main voice from an album, the “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” soundtrack, that has sold over seven million copies in the United States?)        
Even though they’re unexpected twists in Avicii’s otherwise clean ascent, these songs don’t arrive in a vacuum. They sit comfortably next to the king-size crossover country and folk of recent years — think Mumford & Sons, or the dubstep song on the last Taylor Swift album. Even Keith Urban has a fake club song on his new album. And that’s to say nothing of the emergent trend of club remixes of country hits by the likes of Dee Jay Silver and DJ DU. (And yes, there was disco-country in the 1970s, for what it’s worth.)        
Marry that to the recent impulse among a certain more classicist stripe of dance-music act to bring the genre back to organic roots — Daft Punk’s last album repudiates the last couple of decades of computer music — and Avicii’s musical choices feel savvy and timely. (Along with the selections of his manager, Ash Pournouri, who receives a writing credit on almost every song on this album.)        
That Avicii is testing himself, and his public, is clear. “Heart Upon My Sleeve,” which features vocals from Dan Reynolds of the alt-rock preservers Imagine Dragons, opens up like an acoustic Queensryche song. “Shame on Me” is swing music, more or less, and a less successful hybrid than Avicii’s roots experiments.        
Compared with “Wake Me Up” and “Hey Brother,” the rest of “True” doesn’t offer much challenge, even if it is thoroughly effective in places. “Dear Boy” is completely straightforward electro-infused house, and it’s sharp. “Lay Me Down,” produced in part by Nile Rodgers, who is having a banner year, and featuring a bracing vocal by Adam Lambert, is completely valid modern disco, faithful to the genre as it once was but not a slavish throwback. It’s another escape into yesteryear by an artist carrying today — and tomorrow — on his shoulders.

The world championships are under way in Bali, Indonesia. There are 22 teams in each of the three events: the Venice Cup, Bermuda Bowl and d’Orsi Senior Trophy. After a round robin of 16-board matches, eight will qualify for the knockout matches, which begin on Tuesday.        


After two days, the Venice Cup teams are well placed, USA-2 being third and USA-1 fourth. In the d’Orsi Senior Trophy, USA-2 was ninth and USA-1 tenth, close behind eighth. The two Bermuda Bowl teams, though, are doing badly, with USA-1 15th and USA-2 20th. (All team rosters and results are at worldbridge.org.)        
The first round contained many exciting boards. USA-2 in the Bermuda Bowl lost to Argentina. Slams were bid on three deals, and Argentina gained a huge 42 international match points on those boards. The diagramed deal was one of the American highlights, when Chip Martel (East) defended better than his opposite number.        
Both Souths ended in four spades doubled, sacrificing over four hearts (a contract that would have been touch-and-go). In the given auction, Martel’s one-no-trump response was semiforcing. He had planned to rebid three hearts, showing game-invitational values and three-card support.        
In four spades, South had three top losers: two hearts and one club. So he couldn’t afford to concede a spade trick.        
Each West led a low heart. How should East have defended?        
At the first table, Gabino Alujas (East) won with his ace and shifted to the diamond six. Mike Kamil (South) ruffed and would have done best to play a club. Instead, he led a heart, giving the defenders a second chance. East took the trick, but returned the diamond queen.        
Now declarer played perfectly. He discarded a club and won with dummy’s ace, led a spade to his nine, played a club to dummy’s king, finessed his spade ten, led a club to the queen, trumped a diamond in his hand and ruffed his last heart. With eight tricks in, South led a diamond and had to score two more trump tricks with his queen and ace.        
At the other table, Martel won the first trick with his heart queen, cashed the heart ace and played a third heart. When that was ruffed in the dummy, declarer could no longer take three spade finesses.        
Hector Camberos (South) ruffed a diamond with his spade eight, played a club to dummy’s king and ran first the spade jack (dropping his nine), then the spade seven (underplaying his deuce). Now declarer ruffed a diamond to reduce his trump length to two (the same as East) and led a club. But Zia Mahmood (West) defended accurately. He won with his ace and led his last heart, on which East discarded his remaining club. South had to lose a trump trick for down one.        
Plus 590 and plus 100 gave 12 imps to USA-2.

Britt Levine, 33, who lives in Los Angeles and works in media sales for Clear Channel, has a 2-month-old baby boy and says that the colorful blankets she uses to wrap him, made by a company based there named Munchkin, are a way to extend her love of fashion to her newborn. Her regular afternoon promenades with her son at the Grove, an upscale mall, are a sea of strollers with colorful swaddle blankets draped over them.        


“It’s become a thing where moms are checking out what swaddle blankets other moms have,” Ms. Levine said. “The ones I have with their catchy prints is my way to make a statement.”        
There are designer diaper bags and “it” strollers, but until recently the swaddle blanket, used since ancient times to wrap babies tightly and give them a sense of security, has floated above trends.        
That has started changing, most notably in July, when Kate Middleton and Prince William stood on the steps of St. Mary’s Hospital in London to introduce their son, Prince George Alexander Louis. The royal newborn was swathed in a white muslin blanket adorned with green birds from Aden + Anais, a Brooklyn brand. The four-pack Jungle Jam set that included it immediately sold out, said the company’s founder, Raegan Moya-Jones, and sales of all of its swaddles over the next month increased almost 200 percent from the same time period the previous year.        
Ms. Moya-Jones started Aden + Anais after she moved to the United States from Australia, gave birth to her daughter (Anais), and couldn’t find the wraps made from loosely woven cotton muslin that were a staple back home. “In Australia, you would buy muslin wraps in four packs of white, but I wanted something with more of a design element,” she said.        
Weeks after she introduced two patterns in 2006, Adam Sandler was pictured in US Weekly walking with his wife on the beach with their baby draped in one of her swaddles, which cost around $20 each and are sold at Neiman Marcus and Kitson.        
Sandra Bullock, Beyoncé and Hilary Duff are also fans. “Once Luca was too big to be swaddled, we used them at the park or draped them over his stroller for shade,” Ms. Duff wrote in an e-mail.        
Other companies have followed. Little Giraffe, a blanket company based in Van Nuys, Calif., has patterned swaddles in jacquard dot, links, stripes and zigzag made from sandwashed muslin ($48 for a package of two).        
Munchkin’s swaddles ($50 for a package of 2) are made from rayon derived from bamboo pulp, and include batiks, oversize florals and diamond patterns.        
And Summer Infant, a Woonsocket, R.I., brand known for its high-tech monitors, ventured into swaddling in 2009 with its SwaddleMe wraps (starting at $13.99). At first there were only solid colors, but the company soon hired a fashion director who has a background in textile design, Richard Graumann, and there are now 150 options with new ones added regularly.        
“I get the inspiration for my patterns straight from the runways,” Mr. Graumann said. “The wraps with the animal-skin prints and ones in bright oranges and yellows, for example, mimicked the trends from last season.”        
Sarah Demarest, 36, a stay-at-home mom in Washington, likes the SwaddleMe wraps so much she used a leopard-printed one for the birth announcement picture of her two-month-old daughter, which Ms. Demarest said won raves from family and friends.        
“We take so many photos of her, and I want to look back on them and like the way she is dressed, and an attractive swaddle is key to that,” she said.

CHICAGO — At a time of rapid change in the gay-rights movement, from marriage to the military, the purpose of a strictly gay theater company isn’t the same as it was 10 years ago. Andrew Volkoff, now in his fourth month as the artistic director of About Face Theater, is about to discover what it might turn out to be.        


He’s doing so in a highly competitive theater market where “Angels in America” — Tony Kushner’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “gay fantasia on national themes” — is more likely to be mounted by a general-interest company than in his own auditorium.        
His answer so far: Stick with us.        
“There’s always going to be somebody’s first year coming out,” said Mr. Volkoff, 45, in an recent interview in the lobby of the Biograph Theater on the North Side here. “There are always going to be men in their 30s or 40s divorcing their wives because they are comfortable enough to come out, or women leaving their husbands because they’re in love with other women. You’re always going to have people at different points in their lives who need to hear these stories.”        
That Mr. Volkoff was speaking in the lobby of a theater where About Face rents space, however, points to the challenges ahead — as does his first full season, announced last week. It marks a carefully shaped but scaled-back lineup that includes “Brahman/i,” a solo show about an Indian intersex person, as well as a youth theater play, readings and a holiday musical.        
“For us to stay healthy enough to continue to make art in the future requires us to — and I hate this word —  right-size the budget,” he said. “We really took a close look at the last two seasons in terms of budgeting and wanted to make sure that we were able to deliver something that satisfied audiences and made sense financially.” Part of that means keeping cast sizes small and theater rental costs low.        
Founded in 1995 by Kyle Hall and Eric Rosen, About Face is a relative newcomer to the gay theater world. Troupes that formed in the years after the 1969 Stonewall uprising, like Theater Rhinoceros in San Francisco and the Other Side of Silence in New York, celebrated sexual difference, challenged gender roles and rallied the political troops. When AIDS surfaced in the 1980s gay companies offered rage and solace with polemical plays.        
Over time, gay-themed works broke into the mainstream, including Broadway. While the Tony-winning “Torch Song Trilogy,” had its roots at La MaMa E.T.C., a gay-friendly downtown Manhattan space, many other popular gay shows were not nurtured at gay theaters. “Angels in America” first emerged at two nongay theaters, through a commission by the Eureka Theater in San Francisco, and with further development at the Center Theater Group in Los Angeles.        
“What was a very clear genre of gay play — one that had a clear message of we’re here and we deserve our rights — I think we’ve moved on from that,” said the playwright Jonathan Tolins, whose comedy “Buyer & Cellar,” about a gay man who works for Barbra Streisand, is having a successful commercial Off Broadway run at the Barrow Street Theater in New York. “I think everyone knows we’re here now.”        
Yet gay theaters helped launch the careers of writers who were not quickly championed otherwise.        
Christopher Shinn had his first full-length play produced in the United States in 2000 when About Face mounted his drama “Four,” which had been staged in London two years earlier. (It played New York in 2001.) What sets gay theaters apart, Mr. Shinn said, is their eagerness “to explore things that are difficult.”        
“There may be elements of gay experience, no matter how integrated gay people get, that remain different, that don’t have enough mainstream appeal to be programmed at regular nonprofit theaters,” he said.        
But like other playwrights, he is glad to see his work reach the widest possible audience. The Goodman Theater here produced his latest play, the gay-bullying-themed “Teddy Ferrara,” earlier this year. “I think a lot of people felt there was a validation of the queer experience to be at a big mainstream theater, and to be dealing with those issues,” he said.        
Now the artistic director of Kansas City Repertory Theater in Missouri (a general-interest theater), Mr. Rosen remembers the early days of About Face as “largely the community talking to itself about itself in a safe space.” The first productions “weren’t for a larger audience,” he said, “but they stood metaphorically for the larger world.”        
Since then the theater has mounted widely done works by Neil LaBute (“Bash”) and Richard Greenberg (“Take Me Out”) as well as first-time and teen playwrights. About Face’s 2012-13 season ended this summer with an extended run of “The Pride,” Alexi Kaye Campbell’s era-jumping drama about sexual identity and infidelity. (The show played Off Broadway in 2010 with a cast that included Hugh Dancy and Ben Whishaw.)        
The financial health of About Face, which like many theaters has suffered in the economic downturn, offers a snapshot of the challenges ahead for gay theaters. Attendance in the last five years has fluctuated, from a low of about 5,600 when it presented only two main stage shows, to a high of almost 25,000 last season, when it partnered with commercial producers to mount Paul Oakley Stovall’s gay drama “Immediate Family” in costly rented space at the Goodman.        
The company’s current budget is down from a high of $1.2 million in the early 2000s, but at $700,000 is up 9 percent over the year before. While About Face has been in the black the last two years, Mr. Volkoff attributed its budget decline to “a shrinking of donor bases, individual giving, foundations and grant makers, corporate giving and giving, period.”        
He succeeded Bonnie Metzgar, who during her five-year tenure initiated a strategic planning and rebranding effort that included a search for a permanent home.  The company has been itinerant since it was kicked out of its first and only home in 2002, when a gym moved into the building. Mr. Volkoff said he hoped to “put down roots” in three years.        
“Audiences need to know where to find you,” he said.        
That includes straight attendees, too. John Alexander, the executive director of San Diego’s gay Diversionary Theater, said 45 percent of its roughly 475 subscribers do not identify as gay. The way to reach a wider audience, he said, is to “not just do the same old white gay coming-out story anymore.”        
And when in doubt, camp sells. Diversionary’s new season includes “She-Rantulas From Outer Space” and the cross-dressing Christmas show “Scrooge in Rouge.”        
It’s a lesson Mr. Volkoff has learned quickly.  In November About Face will remount last year’s holiday hit “We Three Lizas.”        
“Doing lighter fare allows us to attract an audience that will see the strength of our work,” he said. “It’s a gateway drug to more challenging fare. Both are what keep us going.”

Shortly after a downpour hit Manhattan last Thursday, Zachary Quinto abandoned his car and driver to the gridlock on Madison Avenue and walked up to the Hotel Elysée on East 54th Street. As he apologized for being late, the actor looked up at the red and gold flag emblazoned with the name of the hotel, took out his iPhone and snapped a shot.        


“Wow,” Mr. Quinto said. “Can we go see the room where Tennessee died?”        
“Tennessee” is the playwright Tennessee Williams, who lived and worked in the hotel for about 20 years until his death in 1983, reportedly after choking on a plastic bottle cap. The visit was something of a pilgrimage for Mr. Quinto, who is making his Broadway debut later this month in “The Glass Menagerie,” Williams’s first Broadway production.        
Mr. Quinto, 36, was obliging a request to be interviewed at the Monkey Bar, off the lobby of the Elysée. It was a favorite, convenient bar for the playwright.        
“I was reading about the hotel in anticipation of coming here,” Mr. Quinto said. “Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy and Marlon Brando and Lillian Gish, all of these amazing luminaries of the theater spent time in this place.”        
Seated at a corner red banquette, the actor — dressed in a mauve T-shirt, jeans and high-top sneakers he admitted had been appropriated from a friend — spotted a depiction of Tennessee Williams behind him in the famous Edward Sorel mural that wraps around the restaurant. He attempted to move a lamp for a better look. It was bolted down.        
“Unreal. Unreal,” he said. “It’s a huge thing for me.”        
The day before, Mr. Quinto had appeared at a Cantor Fitzgerald 9/11 benefit held at BGC Partners (its trading floor reminding him of the set of his 2011 movie “Margin Call”), appeared in matinee and evening performances of “Menagerie” and made it to the Standard, High Line hotel for a New York Fashion Week party. He said he was asleep by 3 a.m. “I’m good on six hours,” he said.        
The play, which also stars Cherry Jones, is in previews and is to open Sept. 26. In a glowing review of the Boston production earlier this year, Ben Brantley of The New York Times wrote: “Mr. Quinto, best known for his screen work, is the finest Tom I’ve ever seen, a defensive romantic, sardonically in love with his own lush powers of description.”        
Mr. Quinto, who studied acting at Carnegie Mellon, talked about developing the character of Tom, Williams’s given name.        
“Tom is the most autobiographical character in his canon, so it became clear to me right away that, as the point of entry, the more I could learn about Tennessee and understand what he was trying to capture, and the same time what he wanted to run away from, the better off I’d be,” he said.        
Mr. Quinto started with a biography by Lyle Leverich, “Tom: The Unknown Tennessee Williams,” concentrating on the family dynamics depicted in the play among the aging mother and her two adult, unmarried children.        
“There is no shortage of works about the life of Tennessee, or works by Tennessee or both,” he said with a laugh and a slight eye roll.        
He moved on to the playwright’s memoirs, the first MGM screenplay of “Menagerie” and all the versions of the short story that morphed into the play.        
“In the screenplay, there’s actually a scene where Tom goes to the movies and meets a young girl and has a quixotic interaction with her,” he said in his deep baritone. “It informs my understanding how Tom fills his time not in the apartment. All of that is really exciting.”        
Lunch — tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich — arrived. (Perfect on a rainy day, Mr. Quinto said.)        
It got him talking about a scene in which the cast mimes the act of having dinner (sans tableware and food) and yet communicates the bond of that experience.        
“The feeling of what it is to eat, the emotional relationships you have with the people you are eating with, these are the things that are important,” he said, “and the things that Tennessee was trying to convey.”        
In researching the character, Mr. Quinto, who came out as gay in 2011, considered the struggles Williams had with his own sexuality.        
“I think it is something that plagued Tennessee his whole life, something he really wrestled with,” he said. “I don’t think it ever fully resolved for him. I feel much more resolved in my own life.”        
And, not surprisingly, Mr. Quinto considered how sexuality informed the character he plays.        
“I think Tom knows that his relationship to alcohol and his constant seeking of adventure, as he calls it in the play, belies a kind of desire that he is not able to fully embrace,” he said.        
After lunch, John Avina, the general manager of the Elysée, took Mr. Quinto on a quick tour of the Tennessee Williams Suite, which is not the playwright’s old rooms but the apartment of the former owner of the property. There were plays on the bookshelves, photographs and a framed letter from Williams to a friend who was to visit, which gave the name and address of the hotel. Mr. Quinto read aloud: “I’ll probably still be alone as my friend is having a vacation in Veracruz, Mexico. He is attracted to sinister places.”        
The actor politely asked to see the rooms where the writer had spent his final days, but was told they were occupied. Mr. Avina handed him a card, and said he would arrange for him to visit or stay on a night when the play was dark.        
“Thanks, man,” Mr. Quinto said, heading to rehearsals. “I’ll definitely be in touch.”

Sports,"










GOTHENBURG, Sweden — Last month, I lay in bed in Sweden with my computer tuned to the inaugural championship game of the National Women’s Soccer League. It was 2 a.m., and through sleepy eyes I watched the starting lineups walk out in Sahlen’s Stadium in Rochester. I couldn’t help but reminisce about my last professional game in the United States — played in that same stadium — the 2011 championship game of Women’s Professional Soccer.        


As the Portland Thorns celebrated the championship, I watched on the screen from a different place — literally (across the world in Europe) and mentally — than when I celebrated on that field in 2011 with the Western New York Flash. Since then, I have played for three different clubs: one in Russia, a W-League team in New Jersey and now for Kopparbergs/Goteborg in Sweden. All of a sudden, the new American league seemed foreign to me.        
As an outside observer, the coverage of the N.W.S.L. has been excellent. The games have all been available for me to follow, although I have only caught a handful because of the time difference. As much as I do know about the league, I’ve realized there are a lot of areas in which I am out of the loop. Many of the players I know well and have played with over the years, but there were also some unfamiliar faces. Since I played in the U.S., there are also two new franchises — the Thorns and the Seattle Reign.        
Playing in W.P.S. was my first professional experience, so I didn’t have much with which to compare. Now, as a slightly more experienced professional, my observations of the N.W.S.L. are influenced by my feel for European women’s soccer and how the game is growing globally, in addition to in the U.S.        
In Sweden, while there is fantastic support for the women’s game, there is a different emphasis on marketing and attendance. Damallsvenskan (the Swedish women’s league) games have much smaller turnouts than the numbers I was seeing in N.W.S.L. game reports, but, for the most part, the teams here do not rely on ticket sales as a source of income. Most clubs have a number of local and corporate sponsors who support the team regardless. Hence the extreme number of logos on most Swedish team uniforms, sometimes including ones on the posterior of the shorts.        
I am hoping to watch the N.W.S.L. sustain itself and flourish over the coming years. Playing in Europe has opened my eyes to how the plans need to be long-term. Teams in Sweden and in Europe have gradually developed a culture, style and system of play. It’s something I really appreciate about playing abroad and hope to see take place in the U.S. In Sweden, there is a promotion-relegation system with a second league, Champions League spots to aim for and the Swedish Cup. Every team has something to fight for, regardless of its standing in the 12-team first division. This has taken time to evolve, but I’d love to see professional women’s soccer in the U.S. reach that point down the road.        
Seeing the photos of the Portland Thorns celebrating their title took me back to 2011, but also took me forward in time with hopes that the league will continue to provide playing opportunities for American, Canadian and Mexican players, and also begin to expand to attract players from elsewhere in the world.        
It is an impressive league with wonderful talent and dedicated fans. With my added perspective from playing in Europe, I realize how much N.W.S.L. is truly in its infancy. As Americans, we always look to quickly make things bigger, better and more successful. Like most invested followers and participants, I think there should be some tweaks made to the N.W.S.L. to continue to improve from season to season. After playing elsewhere, however, and seeing that even the leagues with great history and parity are not perfect, I have come to the conclusion that the N.W.S.L.'s opening season was a success.

They are three of Norman Rockwell’s best-known paintings of homey, small-town America published on the covers of The Saturday Evening Post — “Saying Grace,” “The Gossips” and “Walking to Church.”        


But the decision to auction them at Sotheby’s in December will signify the end of a decade of unhomey legal squabbling among the heirs of the art director who gave Rockwell his assignments from World War II to the eve of the Vietnam War.        
“It’s time to move forward,” said Jonathan Stuart, a son of the artworks’ original owner, Kenneth J. Stuart, who was the longtime art director of The Saturday Evening Post.        
Of Rockwell’s 322 covers for The Post, the three images were particularly popular. “Saying Grace” — a crowded restaurant with a boy and an old woman bowing their heads in prayer — was considered Rockwell’s masterpiece, topping a readers’ poll in 1955. “The Gossips” was a finger-wagging montage of friends, neighbors and even the artist himself. “Walking to Church” was another timeless favorite.        
Some scholars of American art predict that the sale of these paintings on Dec. 4 could become — given their caliber, celebrity and condition — the auction of the year in an area of the art market that has not bounced back since the collapse of the world financial markets in 2008. Experts say that two have a chance of topping the record price for Rockwell at auction, $15.4 million, which was set in 2006 for “Breaking Home Ties,” an image of a fresh-faced boy leaving home for the first time.        
“They are iconic images of 20th-century American culture, all three of them,” said Virginia M. Mecklenburg, chief curator of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, who organized a blockbuster Rockwell show there in 2010.        
“Each one of these paintings is just as relevant now as when they were made,” she added.        
For the sons of Kenneth J. Stuart, though, the story behind the sale is not so cozy.        
Curtis Publishing, which owned The Saturday Evening Post, tried, unsuccessfully, to claim ownership of the paintings. (The company does have reproduction rights to the images on countless objects, including mugs and mouse pads, porcelains and playing cards.)        
Heirs of Kenneth Stuart were embroiled in their own legal battles, too, when he died in 1993. He left his entire estate to his three sons — Ken Jr., William and Jonathan — in equal shares. But shortly after his death William and Jonathan sued their older brother, Ken Jr., claiming that he had taken advantage of their ailing father, forcing him to sign papers to gain control of the fortune, and contending that Ken Jr. had used estate assets for his own expenses. Only recently did the brothers settle out of court.        
“It’s been a long road,” said Jonathan Stuart, the youngest brother, in an interview.        
The value of the three paintings was next to nothing when they were produced in the late 1940s and early ’50s, but Mr. Stuart now called them “precious heirlooms” — so precious, in fact, that he and his brothers simply could no longer afford the insurance and upkeep.        
Sotheby’s estimates that “Saying Grace,” on the cover of the Nov. 24, 1951, issue, could bring at least $15 million to $20 million. The painting hung in Kenneth J. Stuart’s office at The Saturday Evening Post and later in his family’s living room in Wilton, Conn. “Walking to Church,” thought to bring between $3 million to $5 million, was in the bedroom of his wife, Katharine.        
“Dad never hung ‘Gossips,’ ” Jonathan Stuart said. “None of us could figure out why.” That painting is expected to fetch $6 million to $9 million.        
Mr. Stuart, 67, who lives in Manhattan and owns a record company, recalled that when he was a teenager his parents often left him at the Rockwell home in Stockbridge, Mass., where the artist lived from 1953 until his death in 1978.        
“I wish I’d known when I was hanging out in his studio and he was teaching me how to draw a horse how famous he’d become,” Mr. Stuart said. “I would have gotten him to sign one of his teaching sketches.”        
He described his father and Rockwell as “best friends.” The elder Kenneth Stuart also created covers for The Saturday Evening Post before becoming the magazine’s art director.        
“As an artist Ken Stuart knew how to talk to Rockwell,” said Elizabeth Goldberg, director of American art at Sotheby’s. “But he also had an uncanny commercial sense.”

PARIS — Early on the morning of Sept. 11, a 67-year-old jeweler in Nice, France, raised his unlicensed semiautomatic pistol and shot a teenager in the back as he and an accomplice sped away on a motor scooter with gems they had stolen at gunpoint, prosecutors said. The body of the youth, Anthony Asli, 19, was discovered on a nearby street lined with small grocery markets; the jeweler, Stephan Turk, was arrested last week and charged with murder.        


The case has set off a national debate in France about how to define self-defense, and about the decision to charge Mr. Turk. Many have rallied behind the jeweler, lauding him as a hero who was protecting his life and property, while others have accused him of being a reckless and unfeeling vigilante.        
The far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen said he “would have done the same” as Mr. Turk, and a Facebook page created to support Mr. Turk by an anonymous author has attracted about 1.6 million “likes” — a figure so high that some social-network experts have challenged its veracity.        
At first Mr. Turk was held in police custody, but after a public outcry, he was moved to an undisclosed location under house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor. Mr. Asli’s sister, Alexandra Asli, said Mr. Turk deserved prison for shooting her brother in the back. Mr. Asli’s father said his son had been shot “like a pigeon.”        
The killing has also prompted a loud national discussion about rising crime rates.        
While gun violence in France is relatively rare, thefts are on the rise, and commentators and lawyers said Mr. Turk had become a potent symbol for French people frustrated with being robbed. According to data from the National Observatory on Delinquency, which monitors crime, there is one theft every 90 seconds on average in France, and petty crimes like purse snatching have jumped 17 percent compared with last year.        
The narrative embraced by Mr. Turk’s supporters pits Mr. Asli, a onetime horticulture student with a love of motorcycles and a string of previous convictions for assault, theft and driving offenses, against Mr. Turk, a prosperous business owner in a city where 400 jewelry robberies occurred last year.        
Under French law, a person who kills in self-defense when threatened with imminent bodily harm is not guilty of murder. But prosecutors said Mr. Turk would have a hard time proving that he had been fighting for his life because Mr. Asli was shot in the back. Mr. Turk may instead be convicted of manslaughter, which would carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.        
Eric Morain, an expert on criminal law in Paris who defends people in self-defense cases, said the Nice case had spurred a national reflex of empathy for Mr. Turk, whom many saw as the underdog because he was the victim of a crime before he shot Mr. Asli.        
“The case has created a passionate debate and split the country in two, as many people identify with Mr. Turk,” Mr. Morain said.        
After the left-wing newspaper Libération lamented on Monday that the support on Facebook for Mr. Turk was “worrying” and “unprecedented,” a reader using the name Rantamplan insisted that the wellspring of admiration for Mr. Turk showed that France was dominated by reactionary right-wingers. “Some people feel that property is worth more than a life,” the reader wrote online in the comments section.        
Eric Bedos, a Nice prosecutor, told reporters that Mr. Turk was held up at gunpoint by two young men as he opened for business on Sept. 11, and that security-camera video showed him being punched and kicked, and then opening his safe.        
In a statement to French television after he was charged on Friday, Mr. Turk said of Mr. Asli: “I regret what happened; I regret that he is dead. But he decided to do what he did. It is normal that I would defend myself.”        
French news reports said that Mr. Asli, who was brought up in Carros, a village in southeastern France, had a long record of arrests and convictions and had most recently left prison in April.        
Even so, the father of Mr. Asli said, he did not deserve what happened to him, the newspaper Nice-Matin reported. “He was a little delinquent, a scooter thief,” the newspaper quoted the father as saying. “But he had the face of a child, and no child should have to die like that.”        
The charges against Mr. Turk tapped a spring of anger in Nice, where jewelers closed their stores for 15 minutes on Monday and hundreds of people gathered in one of the city’s main squares to protest. The French interior minister, Manuel Valls, visited the city on Tuesday.        
President François Hollande said in an interview on the French channel TF1 on Sunday that he recognized the “exasperation and anger” in the case, but that “it’s up to the justice system to do justice, and no one else.”

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg does not want to talk about the race to succeed him. He does not want to talk about his legacy. And, thanks very much, he is not particularly impressed with those questions.        


At a news conference on Wednesday on the Lower East Side, Mr. Bloomberg snapped at several reporters who wanted to hear his thoughts about the end of the Bloomberg era and the start of New York City’s next chapter.        
When one reporter suggested that a mixed-use development he was announcing might be one of his last such initiatives as mayor, he looked at her as though she were a lobotomy patient.        
“I hope not,” he said. “We’ve got 104 days, and you can rest assured we’ll be working as hard as we can. Why do you assume that?”        
Before she could answer, he went on: “You probably wrote that after the second term we wouldn’t do anything. And I think we’ve done more in the third term than any administration’s ever done — certainly more than we did in the first and second term.”        
When the reporter asked him to reflect on his development legacy, he sniffed, “I’m not sure what the word even means.”        
In fairness, Mr. Bloomberg has plenty to be annoyed about these days. In the race to succeed him, the candidate who has been his sharpest critic, Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, is leading the Republican nominee, Joseph J. Lhota, by 43 points, according to the latest WNBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll.        
Mr. Lhota is generally more positive about Mr. Bloomberg’s tenure, but even he is emphasizing his differences from the mayor on the campaign trail.        
Campaign rhetoric is not the only irritant for Mr. Bloomberg these days.        
On Tuesday, a federal judge rejected the city’s request to stay her order for changes to the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practice.        
When a reporter asked about Judge Shira A. Scheindlin’s decision, saying that the judge had “ruled against you on the appeal,” the mayor interrupted.        
“No, no, she didn’t rule against me — she ruled against the people of the city,” he said.        
Saying that the ruling had been expected, Mr. Bloomberg continued, “I don’t know why it’s even newsworthy, and I don’t know that anybody even covered it other than a tiny bit.”        
Another reporter asked what the mayor thought of the many voters in the primary who said in exit polls that they wanted to see the city move in a new direction.        
Why did he think that was the case?        
“I don’t know, that’s up to your job to find out,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “I really have no idea. All I can do is tell you what we’ve done. If you want to write that, or if you want to make up some stuff, that’s totally up to you. I have no idea.”        
Finally, a reporter asked whether a poll released on Tuesday evening, which showed Mr. de Blasio leading Mr. Lhota 65 to 22 among likely voters, amounted to a repudiation of his mayoralty.        
“I haven’t read last night’s polls, I don’t know what they say,” he said brusquely.        
“Why would you repudiate — I don’t understand the question,” he went on. “We’re supposed to do the best job we can, and pretty hard to argue most people aren’t happy with the city and the way it goes.” Then, referring to his press secretary, Marc LaVorgna, he added, “Marc told me there’s even polls out that say I’m popular.”        
In a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted late last month, 44 percent of city voters approved of Mayor Bloomberg’s job performance, and the same percentage disapproved. Eleven percent had no opinion.          
In any case, not all is going badly for the mayor. According to the latest Forbes 400 list, released Wednesday, his estimated net worth has risen to $31 billion, up $4 billion since March, enabling him to retain his place as the nation’s 10th richest person.

When Keehnan Konyha, a 32-year-old Brooklyn designer, surveys the landscape of bedding, he sees “a lot of florals” and “a lot of birds,” he said, but not much that appeals to young men with the least bit of urban in their souls. Into this void Mr. Konyha has dropped black-and-white bedding, the inaugural collection from his new company, Safe House USA. The duvet sets and throw pillows have windowpane grids, flecks lifted from the covers of composition notebooks and even the look of marble (shown, $35). The demands of printing these patterns required Mr. Konyha to use synthetic fabric (he chose a soft polyester poplin), but the upside is that the bedding is a dream to clean. “I just came from a photo shoot where somebody spilled split pea soup on a pillow,” he said. “A little soap and water and it came right off.” Information: safehouseusa.com.

Q. There’s a dining alcove off the kitchen in my one-bedroom apartment. Should I turn it into a second bedroom? 


A.“When someone can see that the dining area can become a second bedroom, it’s a plus for resale,” said Mady Faber, an associate real estate broker with Town Residential in Manhattan. “For a growing family or a couple, being able to buy a one-bedroom that can be converted to a two-bedroom means they can stay there for many more years if they have a baby or need to work at home.”        
The mere potential for this kind of conversion, she added, will generally make the apartment worth more money than a straight one-bedroom that cannot be converted.        
And moving ahead with the conversion before listing the property can make the home even more appealing. Just make sure you really do have enough space, she said, because “aesthetically, if the living room is small and you cut off the dining area to create a second bedroom, it might seem cramped.” And that could turn off potential buyers.        
The kitchen should also have a separate entrance that isn’t through the new bedroom, so the flow of space doesn’t feel awkward.        
There are several other basic requirements the space must meet to be considered a true second bedroom, said James Ramsey, owner of the New York design firm RAAD. The first is “adequate light and air,” he said, meaning the space needs a window. “And there’s a minimum dimension of eight feet that you need for the width of your bedroom,” he said.        
In his SoHo apartment, Mr. Ramsey recently transformed a dining nook into a bedroom for his year-old son. “It’s basically a room that’s calculated to be the minimum size you need for a twin-size bed, a crib and a set of dressers that you can change the baby on top of,” he said. (Mr. Ramsey suggested that anyone considering this should first “reverse engineer” the room based on the furniture that will go in it, to avoid a post-construction surprise.)        
If your space meets the minimum requirements, a second bedroom can often be created with the addition of a single new wall. A permanent wall is one option, Mr. Ramsey noted, but a pressurized wall (a temporary partition that isn’t permanently fastened to structural members, so it can be more easily removed in the future) would also work. Either way, he recommended a pocket door, rather than a swing door, because it’s a space saver.        
And for a more elegant solution, Mr. Ramsey suggested installing sliding partitions or glass doors on tracks, so the room can be opened wide when not in use. “That’s obviously a greater expense,” he said. “But it gives you more light and the illusion of more space.”

In many bathrooms, the tub seems like an afterthought, a soulless scoop of white-enameled cast-iron or acrylic. Stephan Jaklitsch thinks that’s a missed opportunity. A more-interesting tub, he said, could “make your bathroom feel a little more special, and like a real retreat.”        


Mr. Jaklitsch, 45, is a principal of Jaklitsch/Gardner Architects in New York with a number of international projects, including several Marc Jacobs stores. When he travels abroad on business, he often chooses his hotel based on the bathtub. “I’ve been traveling to places like Japan, Norway and London,” he said, where it’s not unusual to find tubs designed with long, deep soaking sessions in mind. “Especially in cold, wet climates, there’s a history of cultures using heated water to heat themselves.”        
For a similarly appealing bathtub at home, he suggested unexpected materials like lightweight concrete, wood, zinc, copper and carved stone. And if you want it to make a sculptural statement, he said, consider a free-standing tub rather than a built-in model.        
“Even though New York apartments are very small,” he said, “there’s this whole trend toward free-standing bathtubs.”        
At AF New York in the Flatiron district, Mr. Jaklitsch admired the Ofuro larch wood soaking tub by Rapsel. “I do like a wood tub, because it echoes the Japanese onsen soaking experience,” he said, referring to the country’s hot springs.        
The wood is sealed for easy maintenance, he said, and “will feel softer and a little bit warmer” than many other tubs.        
He also liked the Spoon XL by Agape, made from a material called Cristalplant, in a large egglike form.        
“It has a very comfortable backrest,” he said. And even better, “it can accommodate two people.”        
For a tub with a more traditional look, he pointed out the Kallista for Town tub by Michael S. Smith at Ann Sacks. “It’s a classic New York tub,” he said, inspecting the beefy, rounded rim. “I could see it in a historic town house.” And the 20-inch depth, he added, is a luxury.        
At Simon’s Hardware and Bath, he found a boxy tub called Cube, from Wetstyle. “It would work free-standing or in an alcove,” he said, “in a space-challenged bathroom” or “against a wall of glass.”        
So what kind of tub did Mr. Jaklitsch choose for the bathroom in his West Village home?        
“I have a 1930s cast-iron tub that’s extra-long” that came with the apartment, he said. “I renovated the bathroom, but kept the tub.”

Virginia DiSciascio Antique Textiles was a fixture on the Upper East Side for more than a quarter-century, until Ms. DiSciascio retired last year. Six months later, Ms. DiSciascio’s daughter, Audrey, and her assistant designer, Perla Nuñez, bought the inventory and added to it. They traveled to estate sales, auction houses and private collections in Europe and bought 17th-century Italian vestments, Ottoman Empire robes decorated with needlepoint, and Japanese ikat. In January, they opened their own shop, Antique Textiles Collection, where their clients include the interior designers David Easton and Michael Smith. An 18th-century Italian chandelier from a Paris flea market is the centerpiece of the 400-square-foot boutique. In addition to selling rare fabrics, the women use them to make room dividers and sofa cushions. A pillow starts at $800. The shop is at 32 East 68th Street, Suite A, (212) 535-0055.

A meander through a small, precious setting describes the experience of visiting the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. And now Michael Van Valkenburgh, the landscape architect, has replicated that experience in a pocket-size garden next to the original museum building and near its new Renzo Piano-designed addition.        
No one is certain why this meditative patch is called the Monks Garden, but it has existed from the time Mrs. Gardner founded the museum in 1903 and undergone a few renovations since then. Mr. Van Valkenburgh introduced a sinuous path that draws out one’s experience of the 0.2-acre garden. And to offset the feeling of enclosure created by a surrounding brick wall, he filled it with a “miniature forest of flowers and trees,” he said. Maple, birch and stewartia provide the canopy, while some 7,000 plants, including hellebore and ferns, carpet the ground. Information: (617) 566-1401 or gardnermuseum.org.

PARIS — Facing growing fears of “hypersexual” young girls, the French upper house of Parliament voted Wednesday to end beauty pageants for those younger than 16.        


The Senate passed the new ban 197-to-146 as an amendment to a larger bill aimed at increasing gender equality. The measure now goes to the lower house, the National Assembly, for discussion and a vote.        
Pageants are popular in smaller towns across France, though far less frequent and less intense than in the United States. And France has no equivalent of American reality shows like “Toddlers & Tiaras” and its spinoff, “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo,” that feature very young contestants.        
Still, the intense focus on beauty here, combined with a surge of images of sexualized, prepubescent girls, has raised fears that the pageants could take on the over-the-top quality of American contests.        
“It is extremely destructive for a girl between the age of 6 and 12 to hear her mother say that what’s important for her is to be beautiful,” Chantal Jouanno, the ban’s champion, said Wednesday. “We are fighting to say: What counts is what they have in their brains.”        
Ms. Jouanno, a former junior minister for environment and a senator representing Paris from the center-right party U.D.I., wrote a report on the “hypersexualization” of children in 2011. The report was commissioned by the health minister in response to public outrage over a photo display in Paris Vogue that featured under-age girls in sexy clothes and postures, with high heels, makeup and painted fingernails. The episode drew attention to the increasing use of very young girls in fashion photography and advertisements.        
France has a number of contests that parents can enroll their children in online. Two, Mini Miss and Graines de Miss (Miss in the Making), have annual beauty pageants of more than 20 contestants, ages 6 to 13, in various cities.        
The French pageants do have some sense of restraint. Some prohibit bathing suit competitions and advertise the contests with photos of little girls dressed up more like fairy-tale princesses than as youthful femmes fatales.        
The 2011 winner of Mini Miss, Océane Scharre, appeared in a white gown, but with her crown askew and little obvious makeup. However, her long sparkling earrings seemed rather too large for the slender little girl.        
Opponents protested that the penalties were too severe: up to two years in prison and a $40,000 fine for anyone who “helps, encourages or tolerates” children’s participation in the contests.        
Some pageant organizers said they were frustrated by the suggestion that they were corrupting girls. Maud Chevalier, who started Graines de Miss in 2001, barred young candidates from wearing heels over 1.4 inches high, short dresses, wigs, makeup and swimsuits.        
“I wanted to organize a contest which respected the child,” Mrs. Chevalier said in an interview. She said the ban showed how “misinformed people are about beauty contests.”        
“They look at beauty contests on TV and in the U.S. where contests aren’t adapted to children,” she said. “They think that children parade on a stage to look like a Barbie.”        
Her own interpretation is quite different. “Children fight against stage fright by wearing a princess dress,” she said.        
“In our contests,” she also said, “girls are princesses for a day, they make friends with others.”

Sebastian Conran, the elder son of the British designer and retailer Sir Terence Conran, has created award-winning housewares for almost three decades. And although he introduced a few of those pieces under his own name, Mr. Conran, who is 57, never had what he calls a “real complete collection where I take full responsibility for the design choices” until now. Universal Expert, a 78-piece range of small kitchen appliances and tabletop accessories, will be introduced at West Elm next week. They are products, Mr. Conran said, “that do more than one job, and do the job better.” His favorites include the stainless steel Box Grater, which folds flat for storage ($30) and the wood-and-stainless Step-Up storage stool ($80). “I’ve always wanted to be a foot taller,” Mr. Conran said of the stool. The pepper and salt mills, shown, are $70 for the set. Information: (888) 922-4119 or westelmmarket.com.

THE recent agreement between the United States and Russia on Syria’s chemical weapons made clear what should have been obvious long ago: President Obama’s effort to uphold international norms against weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East will entangle the United States in a diplomatic and strategic maze that is about much more than Syria’s chemical arsenal.         
President Bashar al-Assad of Syria insists that the purpose of his chemical arsenal was always to deter Israel’s nuclear weapons. If Syria actually disarms, what about Egypt and Israel? Egypt (about whose chemical weapons the United States has been strangely silent) points to Israel. And Israel of course has its own chemical weapons to deter Syria’s and Egypt’s, and it is not about to give them up. A headline in the Israeli daily Haaretz a few days ago stated: “Israel adamant it won’t ratify chemical arms treaty before hostile neighbors.”        
These three countries have not adhered to the Biological Weapons Convention either. And Israel is not a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, despite having developed a formidable nuclear arsenal of its own, which will soon become the central fact in this drama, whether the United States likes it or not.        
An obstacle of America’s own making has long prevented comprehensive negotiations over weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. While the world endlessly discusses Iran’s nuclear capabilities and the likelihood that it will succeed in developing an atomic arsenal, hardly anyone in the United States ever mentions Israel’s nuclear weapons.        
Mr. Obama, like his predecessors, pretends that he doesn’t know anything about them. This taboo impedes discussions within Washington and internationally. It has kept America from pressing Egypt and Syria to ratify the chemical and biological weapons conventions. Doing so would have brought immediate objections about American acceptance of Israel’s nuclear weapons.        
What sustains this pretense is the myth that America is locked into covering up Israeli nuclear bombs because of a 1969 agreement between President Richard M. Nixon and Israel’s prime minister, Golda Meir. For Mr. Nixon, it was mainly about gaining Israeli support in the cold war. He and Mrs. Meir understood the need to discourage the Soviets from providing their Arab allies with nuclear weapons. A declared Israeli nuclear arsenal would have led to pressure for Moscow to do so. But such cold war reasons for America to stay mum evaporated decades ago. Everyone knows the Israelis have nuclear bombs. Today, the main effect of the ambiguity is to prevent serious regional arms-control negotiations.        
All other countries in the region are members of the nonproliferation treaty, but there are still unresolved issues. Syria was caught building an illicit nuclear reactor in 2007, which Israel swiftly bombed. Mr. Assad still has not allowed international inspectors to fully investigate that obliterated reactor site. And Syria’s ally Iran is suspected of trying to assemble its own weapons program to challenge Israel’s nuclear monopoly. Indeed, many analysts believed that Mr. Obama’s decision to issue a “red line” barring the use of chemical weapons in Syria was in fact driven by the perceived need to demonstrate that he was prepared to use force against Iran if it moved further toward nuclear weapons.        
This witches’ brew was supposed to become the subject of an international conference, mandated in 2010 by the unanimous vote of the members of the nonproliferation treaty, including the United States. But that conference hasn’t happened, in part because of White House ambivalence about how it might affect Israel.        
In April, the American assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation, Thomas M. Countryman, expressed hope that the conference would be held by this fall. And earlier this month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, urged all parties to set a conference date “as quickly as possible.” He also argued that it should include Israel and Iran. Russia attempted to include the conference in last week’s agreement, but Secretary of State John Kerry resisted. It is not going to go away.        
If Washington wants negotiations over weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East to work — or even just to avoid making America appear ridiculous — Mr. Obama should begin by being candid. He cannot expect the countries participating in a conference to take America seriously if the White House continues to pretend that we don’t know whether Israel has nuclear weapons, or for that matter whether Egypt and Israel have chemical or biological ones.        
And if Israel’s policy on the subject is so frozen that it is unable to come clean, Mr. Obama must let the United States government be honest about Israel’s arsenal and act on those facts, for both America’s good and Israel’s.

A roundup of products for tans, teeth and talons.  


Bronze Aid 
It’s going to take a few more weeks for summer’s tan lines to fade. Tanee (thetanee.com), a new tan-line corrector pen, may help ease the transition. The featured ingredient is DHA (dihydroxyacetone), a colorless sugar that reacts with amino acids on the skin’s surface. A colleague who had just returned from vacation recently tried it out, and gave the pen a positive review. Although press materials say the shading lasts for a week, our guinea pig reported that the color faded after one shower, but she was still quite pleased with the results. ($5.99, Walgreens.com and other retailers.)        
Breath Blitz 
These mints are like Pop Rocks for grown-ups. Developed by Dr. Thomas P. Connelly, a cosmetic dentist, the 32 Effervescent Breath Treatment with IsoVoxy is available in a 60-packet box for $29.50 featuring four flavors, honey mint, spearmint, lemon mint and the original peppermint. The sugar-free crystals, which you pour onto your tongue to produce the crackling effect, are made with toothpaste additives and zinc in addition to carbon dioxide, the ingredient that creates the party in your mouth (32oc.com).  
Gleam On 
Nail art refuses to die. For the do-it-yourselfers out there, NYX has a new nail jewelry line called Precious Pearls. Available in black, white and opal, each kit comes with a funnel for pouring the tiny “jewels” onto painted nails to produce a 3-D effect ($9.99, nyxcosmetics.com).

Neal Schwartz, a San Francisco architect, is eager to share what he has learned about how to get the look for less.        


Want a sleek, minimalist kitchen? He recommends putting in a glass backsplash and installing open shelving instead of upper cabinets.        
If you’re considering a poured-concrete floor, he suggests adding a small amount (what amounts to few pennies’ worth) of a pigment known as lampblack to make it a chic dark gray, instead of using expensive colored concrete.        
And as an architect, he is always looking for ways to enhance a home’s sense of expansiveness. “You can use all the things on hand that are free — the light, the views — to add value to whatever financial resources you bring,” he said.        
Mr. Schwartz, who teaches at the California College of the Arts and owns a firm called Schwartz and Architecture, is used to counseling anxious city dwellers trying to squeeze more room out of small houses. But after watching several clients get in a knot over whether to go with prefabricated or custom construction, he designed a house of his own to prove a point: that custom design doesn’t have to cost much more, and it has all the advantages that come from a bespoke fit.        
“I just want to push back against the idea that prefab is the only way to get good design at a good price,” he said, “and that custom means fancy.”        
Mr. Schwartz envisioned the low-slung, two-bedroom, two-bath structure, which he called Hydeaway House, as a weekend retreat for himself; his spouse, Ron Flynn; and their two Spinone Italianos, Florence and Aldo. But with the idea that he and Mr. Flynn would eventually retire there (they are both 51), he also designed it with handicapped accessibility in mind.        
The total cost of the 2,000-square-foot home was $720,000, or $360 a square foot. That’s not cheap, but neither is high-quality prefabricated construction, which can cost nearly as much per square foot. (And high-end residential construction in the area is even costlier: typically about $450 a square foot, not including costs like permits, and engineering and design fees.)        
“The biggest strategy to save money is to create a really efficient floor plan that puts the space where it’s going to be felt the most,” Mr. Schwartz said. “I see so many homes where space just seems to be wasted.”        
Accordingly, the L-shaped layout he created — with the kitchen and living area in the center, and identical bedroom suites on either end — wraps around one corner of the site, maximizing open space on the one-acre lot and blocking out views of the neighbors.        
From the outside, the house is unassuming, clad in inexpensive cedar siding. But passing through the front door is like opening a clothbound book and seeing full-color illustrations inside.        
Expanses of glass (which Mr. Schwartz didn’t stint on) take in the view: endless lines of grapevines framed by gnarled California valley oaks. And visual tricks like exterior walls of glass in the showers and windows precisely positioned to look onto particular views help foster the impression of endless space.        
To furnish the house, Mr. Schwartz sought out pieces that would be interesting and durable, but at a comfortable price. “I started at Room & Board to figure out what I wanted, because they have pretty nice stuff,” he said. “And then looked for how to get it some other way.”        
The coffee tables he made from slices of white cypress, with casters so they could be easily moved. The light fixtures in the living room were based on D.I.Y. plans supplied by Lindsey Adelman, the Brooklyn lighting designer, and made with inexpensive parts from the hardware store. And in an effort to get some art up quickly, Mr. Schwartz took an X-acto knife to a book of bird photographs by Andrew Zuckerman.        
The bathroom sconces, from Schoolhouse Electric, were trickier. “I had a few false starts,” Mr. Schwartz said. “I’d open the box, and Ron would say, ‘What were you thinking?’ ”        
He added a little ruefully: “I was trying to save money.”

Those who remember Donny Osmond singing “You Are My Sunshine” on the Andy Williams show in 1963 have probably become so inured to life’s little curve balls that they won’t be surprised to learn that the popular entertainer, now 55 and a grandfather several times over, is about to release a housewares collection with his wife, Debbie. Everyone else, take a moment to compose yourself.        


Donny Osmond Home will kick off in January with 1,000 items, including furniture, lights, rugs, bedding, dinnerware, bath accessories and home-improvement tools. Some of the goods will be available through online retailers later this year; a list will be posted on donnyosmond.com starting on Sept. 24.        
Mr. Osmond discussed his new business from Las Vegas, where he and his sister, Marie, have been performing a long-running nightclub act at the Flamingo Hotel. This interview was edited and condensed.        
Q. Last month, you blogged about a recent operation. How are you?  
A. I knew that would be the first question. It’s a real bummer, let’s put it that way. As Marie said on stage, I broke my butt. I tore the tendon from the gluteus medius muscle right off the bone as I was dancing, but I finished the show in that condition.        
I imagine you’ve found housewares easier on the muscles, but still I wonder what made you veer into design.  
This is something that is more organic than one would imagine. For 35 years now, Debbie and I have been married and she’s always created this wonderful atmosphere at home for me, because my world, as you can imagine, is crazy, with the touring and traveling. Now that we’re getting older, it’s something she and I can do for the rest of our lives together. Because you know the term “family” is pretty synonymous with the term “Osmond.”        
How would you describe the collection? 
I wish Debbie was on the phone, too. There’s going to be — I’m leaning these different types of phraseology because it’s such a new business to me — but it’s more of a transitional style, if that makes any sense. It’s kind of eclectic with a kind of a modern flair. The same way as I’ve handled my career for 50 years, you have to learn to adapt and change. We’re told by our marketing team that honeycomb and the color gray are trending right now, so Debbie and I these last couple of days have sat with our design team, through the computer. We approved certain styles, and it’s perfectly in line with what she and I like.        
I caught glimpses of your Utah home in an interview you did some years ago with Kathie Lee Gifford. It seemed comfortable and traditional. Would you say that sums up the style of Donny Osmond Home? 
Keep in mind that’s the only time we’ve ever opened up our home for an interview, and probably the last. We maintain that our home is very private, even though we’re opening up our style. I think a very comfortable, very homey atmosphere is a nice guideline. But there might be something a little more elegant or a little more transitional. It really depends on the taste of the buyers.        
Having partnered for many decades with your sister, what is it like to work with your wife? Is this your first partnership? 
Yes, it’s the first. No! For 35 years she’s been my partner.        
What does each of you bring to the table?  
I bring the support. She’s got the eye for this. What’s really interesting, over the years our tastes have actually become one. I remember when we first got married in 1978, I was more modern and she was more traditional. But in 1978 the styles were so different, so you’re constantly evolving. That’s what we want to bring to the public: all different kinds of things available at different prices. A lot of people can afford these things.        
Each phase in your career has brought a different relationship to your audience. Who do you hope to connect to with this collection?  
Fantastic question. Let me tell you a story: I look out at the audience every night in Vegas. Right after I won “Dancing With the Stars,” there was a little 10-year-old kid who had watched every week. He was dressed in this suit and he had a tie on and he was with his mom and dad. He was watching me intently through the entire show. Afterward we did a meet-and-greet. I saw this little kid in line, and the closer he got the more excited he got. He came up and shook my hand. He said, “Mr. Osmond, I didn’t know you could sing, too.”        
Here’s another little story: Last year, I had a meeting over at one of the hotels here in Vegas. As I was coming up to give them my car in the parking structure, I heard the song I did for the Disney movie “Mulan.” I followed the sound and came to a van, and all these U.C.L.A. students were in there, half-asleep because they were up all night either gambling or partying. They were on their way back to L.A. I knocked on the window, and the driver rolled down the window and turned the music down. He said, “Can I help you?” I said, “That song you’re listening to. That’s me.” He said: “Are you Donny Osmond? This is our theme song when we have tests and exams.” It starts out, “Let’s get down to business.”        
So now I’ve got fans that are 10-year-olds, college students, parents and grandparents. So here’s the answer to your question: I don’t know. How do you appeal to that wide a demographic? You’ve got to be eclectic. You’ve got to be broad-based.        
You’re probably short on time, but I have another story.        
Do please tell it. 
Last night at the meet-and-greet, this lady comes up to me and she says, “My 5-year-old daughter listens to you all the time.” I said, “Oh, that’s so sweet.” She said, “She keeps asking for ‘Anaconda, Anaconda.’ And we finally realized she was asking for “and they called it ... puppy love.” Now I’ve got a 5-year-old fan.        
What was your home like growing up?  
Which hotel would you really like to refer to? I was always on the road. But seriously, my home, when we did come home from a tour, was a big Spanish house in San Fernando Valley, Calif. It wasn’t elegant, it wasn’t a mansion. We didn’t drive fancy cars. That’s one thing my father and mother taught us: Live within your means. If you have means, don’t flaunt it.        
In your book “Life Is Just What You Make It,” you said that at a low career point you thought of tossing it all in and starting a home security business. Why home security? 
Yeah, it was 1988 and just before “Soldier of Love” hit in 1989, and I had tried so hard to get back out on the charts and couldn’t do it, even with Peter Gabriel’s help. The reason I liked home security is because I was always interested in electronics. I don’t think it had anything to do with my own security. I’m just an electronics geek. I had pretty much lost everything in the early 1980s and I had to rebuild. In 1988, I had three children and I thought, “How am I going to support a family?” That was an alternative, and thank goodness it didn’t go that way.        
If you could relive any decade of your life, which would it be? 
Well, I’ve got to be honest. The ’70s were amazing, even through the purple socks and the “Puppy Love.” Yeah, I enjoyed it but I wished I enjoyed it a little bit more. I’m reading a great book called “The Power of Now.” I’m learning how to enjoy the moment.        
But I have to be honest: I’m enjoying this moment more than any in my life because I really don’t have to prove anything anymore. I’m never going to be in coasting mode. I’m always going to be climbing some kind of mountain. But it’s such an enjoyable time in my life with my wife and kids and grandbabies. And we’re trying to open up that joy we’ve had in our home and make it accessible to other people. That’s the message: Create an atmosphere of love and peace and refuel at home. JULIE LASKY

Giving Them the Hot Shoulder 


A take-away from the streets of New York Fashion Week: Miley wasn’t as off-base as we all thought. We saw shrinking crop tops, loads of bra tops, even an editor in chief baring her midriff. (Eva Chen, we’re looking at you.) Add to that the many women at the shows, as well as on the film festival circuit, flagrantly flaunting their clavicles. No surprise, off-the-shoulder is a good look, a more coy kind of sexy than the cutouts we’ve grown accustomed to. There was the director Gia Coppola, in black velvet Christopher Kane in Venice; Alexa Chung, effortless as she can be, in lace Carven at her “It” book party in London; and on the street in New York, Yasmin Sewell in Isa Arfen and Giovanna Battaglia in one of Prada’s many fall dresses that slip from the shoulder. The Kane and Prada dresses are in stores now, as are other stunners from Alexander McQueen andOscar de la Renta.

NEWPORT, R.I. — The house formerly known as Belcourt Castle now has a Twitter account, a Facebook page and an American flag planted on its meticulously restored Pennsylvania slate roof. Gone are the sidewalk placards announcing the ghost and murder-mystery tours. These are some of the most visible signs that the once-derelict, nearly 40,000-square-foot folly designed by Richard Morris Hunt is under new management.        


One blustery afternoon, water gushed from a sump pump deep in Belcourt’s bowels while its contractor, Joe Triangelo, sunburned and dusty but wearing a proud smile, interrupted his inspection of the reinforced front doorway and its 500-pound oak doors to sweep up a scattering of wood shavings. (Belcourt may be the tidiest construction site in town.)        
“Here’s a funny thing,” Mr. Triangelo said. “If Carolyn hasn’t been here for a few weeks, I get nervous.”        
It was almost a year ago that Carolyn Rafaelian, the 46-year-old founder of Alex and Ani, a rapidly growing, wildly successful New Age jewelry line (think bangles with inspirational charms, now sported by Olympic athletes, the Dalai Lama and millions of teenage girls), and a daughter of Cranston, R.I., bought the house for $3.6 million. It was a rather low price, except when you consider how many millions of dollars may be required to rehabilitate it.        
“My dream was to own a Newport mansion: that’s what I always wrote in the comment books,” she said, recalling how she would tour the houses here when she was a student at the University of Rhode Island. Ms. Rafaelian, who is now divorced, was married at Beechwood, another former tour property. “Be careful what you wish for,” she said. “But Joe was my insurance. He gave me the confidence.”        
When embarking on a renovation, it’s always nice to have a good relationship with a contractor. Mr. Triangelo, 49, and Ms. Rafaelian fell in love three years ago, locking eyes in a Providence, R.I., restaurant.        
“This is the coolest thing,” Mr. Triangelo said. “Carolyn was just a regular gal then.”        
In 2010, the year he and Ms. Rafaelian met, her company, which she had named for two of her three daughters and had started in a corner of her father’s costume jewelry plant in Cranston six years earlier, recorded revenues of $4.6 million. Last year, that figure had swelled to more than $79 million. Ms. Rafaelian credits her new chief executive, Giovanni Feroce, a former military officer and combat veteran whom she met at a college reunion.        
This year, the company is projecting revenues of $200 million, and Ms. Rafaelian aims to turn Alex and Ani into a lifestyle brand, with candles, home goods and furniture, and is looking for all sorts of brand synergies. In 2012, she opened a string of cafes called Tea and Java. And late last year, a month after closing on Belcourt, she bought Sakonnet Vineyards, a winery in Little Compton, R.I.        
Her plan for Belcourt, which she has renamed Belcourt of Newport, is to open it next summer as a tour house, art gallery and event space. She has already begun using it as a backdrop for her advertising. There has been talk of a reality TV series as well, she said.        
Neighbors are wary but supportive, said Robert Beaver, a chairman of the Bellevue Ochre Point Neighborhood Association.        
“Our No. 1 concern is that it not be a function hall,” he said.        
He described a local zoning scenario that allowed properties like Belcourt, which is zoned as a museum, to operate under certain grandfathered rights, which in Belcourt’s case include 12 events a year, each of which has to be approved by the City Council.        
There has been tension over the house’s use in the past, as in the infamous no-underwear party of 1999, whose 800-plus guests, according to news reports, were required to attend commando-style.        
Ms. Rafaelian’s stewardship marks a new chapter in Belcourt’s somewhat bizarre history. The house was built in the last half of the 19th century for Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont, the son of the financier August Belmont and an eccentric who apparently really loved his horses (some sources note he liked to dress them up, changing their costumes several times a day). It was designed in the style of a French hunting lodge and emblazoned with much hunting insignia.

Eight days after the primary for mayor of New York City, the Board of Elections released updated results on Wednesday that showed Bill de Blasio remaining above the threshold that would prompt a runoff election.        


Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, won 40.88 percent of the votes cast on lever voting machines and with the paper ballots that were given to voters in instances when the machines broke down, according to the board.        
Mr. de Blasio’s total now appears to be slightly higher than the 40.3 percent reflected in election night returns, but the board has yet to finish counting tens of thousands of other paper ballots.        
A runoff will be held Oct. 1 if no candidate receives 40 percent of the vote. But the second-place finisher in the Democratic primary, William C. Thompson Jr., a former city comptroller, conceded the race on Monday, leaving Mr. de Blasio, the public advocate, as the de facto nominee.        
The latest vote totals were the result of a re-examination of the voting machines that began on Friday. According to the new count, Mr. Thompson had 26.25 percent.        
The results still do not include absentee, affidavit and military ballots, which the Board of Elections began counting on Monday, according to a spokeswoman for the board. The board has not said when it expects to complete counting the remaining paper ballots.        
The city will hold a runoff election on Oct. 1 in another race, for public advocate, because neither of the top two candidates, Letitia James, a City Council member from Brooklyn, and State Senator Daniel L. Squadron of Brooklyn, received 40 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary.

WASHINGTON — Builders began construction of single-family homes at a faster pace in August, and building permits for construction hit a five-year high, pointing to resilience in the housing market recovery in the face of higher mortgage rates.        


The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that construction starts on single-family homes surged 7 percent to an annual rate of 628,000 units last month, the highest level in six months. Single-family homes are by far the largest segment of the market.        
Groundbreaking in the volatile apartment and condominium sector tumbled 11.1 percent. That limited the rise in overall housing starts to an 891,000-unit annual rate, much smaller than the 917,000-unit rate economists had expected.        
While higher mortgage rates have slowed home sales, demand for homes, as the rate of household formation rises, is expected to bolster residential construction.        
“Home building seems to be holding up decently in the higher mortgage rate environment, probably due to the support of strong underlying fundamentals — thin inventories and steady household formation,” Guy Berger, an economist, said.        
Mortgage rates have risen in recent months in anticipation that the Federal Reserve was ready to reduce its $85 billion monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, which it has been buying to keep interest rates low and stimulate the economy. The Fed, however, surprised the financial markets on Wednesday by maintaining its bond-buying program and not cutting back. That move could ease mortgage rates.        
In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for home loans rose last week as mortgage rates eased off recent highs. Since early May, rates on 30-year mortgages have risen more than 1 percentage point to about 4.5 percent.        
Still, mortgage rates remain historically low, and economists do not expect the increase to throw the housing recovery off track. Home building is expected to slow a bit this quarter from the second quarter, but still contribute to growth this year.        
Though residential construction accounts for only 3.1 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product, economists estimate that for every single-family home built, three jobs that last for a year are created.        
Last month, building permits for single-family homes rose 3 percent to their highest since May 2008.        
A survey on Tuesday showed that confidence among builders of single-family houses remained near an eight-year high in September, with builders upbeat about prospective buyer traffic.        
“We expect to see a more meaningful rebound in construction activity in the coming months,” said Millan Mulraine, senior economist at TD Securities.        
Building permits for multifamily homes, however, dropped 15.7 percent last month, pushing down overall permits 3.8 percent to an annual rate of 918,000 units.        
The drop in multifamily housing starts and building permits suggested that the higher mortgage rates could be making developers cautious about taking on new projects. Builders have also been complaining about expensive materials and a shortage of labor.

LONDON — Brix Smith-Start was trailed through her store by a mother-daughter fashion duo.        


“They’re ex-models for Mulberry,” she said. “Gladys did runway and Pixie did print.” Pixie snorted like a hog.        
Gladys and Pixie are pugs and lend their names to the line Ms. Smith-Start designs for the Start shops she owns with her husband, Philip Start. The patrons aren’t just customers seeking Rick Owens, Kenzo and Erdem. Many come because of the peculiar celebrity of Ms. Smith-Start, a renown that spans fashion and music.        
The two stages of her life rarely intersect. An exception was when the Fall’s 1984 punk stomper “Copped It” played at the Marc Jacobs spring 2013 runway show. Ms. Smith-Start played guitar on the track and is the ex-wife of the band’s mercurial visionary, Mark E. Smith.        
“Your average Brit knows her as a TV fashion expert,” said Penny Martin, the editor in chief of The Gentlewoman, the British fashion magazine. “Your industry insider recognizes her as the woman that runs Shoreditch’s premier boutique and who can fit your jeans by means of the naked eye. That’s the girls. Boys of a certain age, however, remember her as Brix from the Fall.”        
Ms. Smith-Start, who on this day wore Comme des Garçons drop-crotch trousers and a black voile shirt, is 50, but in her pep and garrulousness is more akin to a chipper teenager. She has lived mostly in England since 1983 but has held on to her American accent. When she slips, it’s charming and natural, not like someone who did junior year abroad and came back Cockney.        
She is the host of “Ultimate Shopper” (now called “Shopaholic Showdown” in Britain), a fashion challenge that is broadcast on TLC in 150 countries (although not in the United States). When not filming, she can be found in her shop helping customers.        
Before she became Brix, she was born Laura Elisse Salenger in Los Angeles. Her single mother, Lucy, was a model turned television producer. “Cher was my baby sitter although I didn’t know her,” Ms. Smith-Start said. “My mom worked at CBS and would put me in the audience of ‘Sonny and Cher,’ and I’d sit for hours while they rehearsed.”        
Lucy married a University of Chicago professor and became director of the Illinois Film Commission. Brix took up the guitar in high school, which is where she got her nickname. Her friends were the punks. “I had an obsession with the Clash,” she said. “My favorite song was ‘Guns of Brixton.’ ” She went to Bennington College, where the freshman class was rife with luminaries.        
“She was already a star,” the writer Jonathan Lethem said. “At Bennington in the early ’80s there were a lot of weirdly ready-for-prime-time teenagers. It was like going to college in Warhol’s Factory. Brix was in the manner of Bret Easton Ellis or some of the painters who were ready for their first show. We were friends but also in her fan club.”        
Mr. Ellis remembers her well. “A lot of people stood out because of bohemian singularities,” he said. “She stood out much more. She had very dramatic makeup and a punk haircut and an attitude. To have the kind of confidence she had at 18 was unusual.”        
She had a simple mantra. “Fake it until you make it,” Ms. Smith-Start said. “I’ve lived my life like that. I said I’m going to look and act like I’m in a band.” With her roommate, Lisa Feder, she formed Banda Dratsing, the name cribbed from “A Clockwork Orange.”        
“They had a fast thrash drone sound,” Mr. Lethem said, “and wore miniskirts under plaid shirts.” In 1983, after her freshman year, she and Ms. Feder took a semester off to pursue music in Chicago. One night they went to see the Fall play. The band, formed in 1976 in Manchester, was a post-punk underground legend in Britain.        
Brix met Mr. Smith at the bar after the show. “He asked me to go to a party,” she said. “I was 19 and carried a cassette with me because I wanted to be a rock star. He put it in the car and said who wrote this and I said I did and he said you’re a genius.”

Mendocino County, Calif. — Twenty years after they embarked on an experiment in communal living, the members of Cheesecake gathered for an anniversary celebration over Labor Day weekend. Nearly 100 people — the seven who live here full time, six who are here part time, and assorted children, grandchildren and friends, including Laura Hartman, one of the architects who designed the complex — spent two days barbecuing, talking, hiking through the redwoods and competing to see who could bake the best cheesecake. (The competition was in honor of the community’s name, which is derived from a loose translation of Casada, the surname of the family who owned the 20-acre property at the turn of the 19th century.)        


The younger and more adventurous among them slept in tents or tepees in the meadow (Ms. Hartman brought her own pup tent), while older visitors bunked together in the residential buildings or stayed in hotels nearby.        
It was a fittingly multigenerational celebration for an idea inspired by the parents of some of the original members, who became increasingly isolated with age: no one should have to grow old alone.        
In 1994, The New York Times reported on how those members, or “partners,” as they called themselves, had settled into their first year of life as a community (“Retirement? For 11 Friends, It’s Off to Camp”). It was one of a number of such experiments, known as cohousing communities, that were springing up around the country at the time, based on a Danish model developed in the 1960s.        
The original group of 11 included four married couples and three women, all in their 50s and 60s, each of whom agreed to pay a monthly fee for the mortgage, taxes and insurance on the 6,000-square-foot complex, as well as a small daily usage charge for utilities whenever they were in residence (food and phone bills were handled individually). Bedrooms and some bathrooms were private, but nearly everything else was shared, an arrangement that seemed feasible given the longstanding friendships of most of the members, who had started a cooperative nursery school for their children when they lived in Southern California in the 1960s. Still, there were three buildings in the complex (two that contained common areas and private apartments and one where residents could pursue their hobbies), because, as Ms. Hartman said in the 1994 article, “Everyone under one roof made people nervous.”        
How did the experiment turn out? On the 20th anniversary, the consensus was generally positive.        
As Helen Papke, 84, observed, it has been a lesson in patience. “When it’s good, it’s so good,” she said. “And when it’s bad, it’s so bad, the angst and argument we have with each other. But we have a conviction to work it out — and we will.”        
Dick Browning, 78, whose wife, Louise, died in 2007, was more effusive. “I love it,” he said. “I love the community.”        
Of the original 11 members, seven are still here, although apart from Ms. Browning, no one has died. (One couple and one woman left for personal reasons.) The community has taken on new members, so there are now 13 altogether.        
No one seems lonely, but some of the residents aren’t quite as energetic as they once were. Take Daniel Myers, a retired lawyer who moved in with his wife, Jill, in 1993, when he was 60. Now, he said, “I can’t get on the roof to get the leaves off, and I can’t chop wood.”        
And needless to say, there have been plenty of compromises along the way. Even something as simple as cutting down a tree or buying a new dishwasher requires a consensus, or at least the agreement of three-quarters of the residents. And getting that many people to agree on anything can take a while.        
Ask Sophie Otis, a clinical psychologist who is now 77, who had to lobby for almost two decades to get rid of the tree obstructing the view from her window. In 1993, when she moved in, it was only six feet tall and she could see around it. Ten years later, at 30 feet, it was starting to block the light. But it wasn’t until January, when it was 45 feet tall and threatening to fall down, that the community agreed to remove it, Ms. Otis said.        
“They finally cut it down this year, not because of my problem with the view,” she said, “but because it was blocking the light and was a hazard in lots of ways.”

In some respects, 1988 has the feel of an alien, distant era. There was no such thing as the World Wide Web then. The Soviet Union was still around; the Berlin Wall still standing. Americans elected a Republican president who would raise taxes to help tame the budget deficit.        


On Tuesday, however, the Census Bureau reminded me how for most Americans 1988 still looks a lot like yesterday: last year, the typical household made $51,017, roughly the same as the typical household made a quarter of a century ago.        
The statistic is staggering — hardly what one would expect from one of the richest and most technologically advanced nations on the planet.        
I have written several times before about how measures of social and economic well-being in the United States have slipped compared to other advanced countries. But it is even more poignant to recognize that, in many ways, America has been standing still for a full generation.        
It made me wonder what happened to progress.        
Consider: 36 years ago this month, when NASA launched the Voyager 1 probe into space, 11.6 percent of Americans were officially considered poor. The other day Voyager sailed clear out of the solar system into interstellar space — the first man-made object to do so — recording its environment on an 8-track deck.        
Using the same official metric — which actually undercounts the poor compared to new methods used by the Census today — the poverty rate is 15 percent.        
To be sure, we have made progress over the last 25 years. The nation’s gross domestic product per person has increased 40 percent since 1988. We’ve gained four years’ worth of life expectancy at birth. The infant mortality rate has plummeted by 50 percent. More women and more men are entering and graduating from college.        
We also have access to far more sophisticated consumer goods, from the iPhone to cars packed with digital devices. And the cost of many basic staples, notably food, has fallen significantly.        
Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley and an expert on technology and innovation who stepped down from President Obama’s Council on Economic Advisors last year, calls the progress in information technology and biotechnology over the last 25 years “breathtaking.”        
“Most Americans partake in the benefits offered by these new technologies, from smartphones to better dental care,” Professor Shapiro said. Still, he acknowledged, “somehow this impressive progress has not translated into greater economic security for the American middle class.”        
In key respects, in fact, the standard of living of most Americans has fallen decidedly behind. Just take the cost of medical services. Health care spending per person, adjusted for inflation, has roughly doubled since 1988, to about $8,500 — pushing up health insurance premiums and eating into workers’ wages.        
The cost of going to college has been rising faster than inflation as well. About two-thirds of people with bachelor’s degrees relied on loans to get through college, up from 45 percent two decades ago. Average student debt in 2011 was $23,300.        
In contrast to people in other developed nations, who have devoted more time to leisure as they have gotten richer, Americans work about as much as they did a quarter-century ago. Despite all this toil, the net worth of the typical American family in the middle of the income distribution fell to $66,000 in 2010 — 6 percent less than in 1989 after inflation.        
Though the bursting of the housing bubble and ensuing great recession takes a big share of the blame for families’ weakening finances, it is nonetheless startling that a single financial event — only a hiccup on the road to prosperity of Americans on the top of the pile — could erase a generation worth of progress for those in the middle.        
Though the statistics may be startling, the story they tell is, unfortunately, not surprising. It is the story of America’s new normal. In the new normal the share of the nation’s income channeled to corporate profits is higher than at any time since the 1920s, while workers’ share languishes at its lowest since 1965.        
In the new normal, the real wages of workers on the factory floor are lower than they were in the early ’70s. And the richest 10 percent of Americans get over half of the income America produces.        
“Almost all of the benefits of growth since the trough of the Great Recession have been going to those in the upper classes,” said Timothy Smeeding, who heads the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Madison-Wisconsin. “Middle- and lower-income families are getting a smaller slice of a smaller economic pie as labor markets have changed drastically during our recovery.”        
This story is about three decades old.        
In 2010, the Department of Commerce published a study about what it would take for different types of families to achieve the aspirations of the middle class — which it defined as a house, a car or two in the garage, a vacation now and then, decent health care and enough savings to retire and contribute to the children’s college education.        
It concluded that the middle class has become a much more exclusive club. Even two-earner families making almost $81,000 in 2008 — substantially more than the family median of about $60,000 reported by the Census — would have a much tougher time acquiring the attributes of the middle class than in 1990.        
The incomes of these types of families actually rose by a fifth between 1990 and 2008, according to the report. They were more educated and worked more hours, on average, and had children at a later age. Still, that was no match for the 56 percent jump in the cost of housing, the 155 percent leap in out-of-pocket spending on health care and the double-digit increase in the cost of college.        
So either we define the middle class down a couple of notches or we acknowledge that the middle class isn’t in the middle anymore.

ATHENS — With a fresh inspection by Greece’s foreign creditors looming next week and labor unions leading a new wave of strikes, the government here has drawn a red line: it will keep pushing economic reforms but vows to impose no more austerity measures on Greeks already battered from three years of tax increases and pension cuts.         
That could prove a hard promise to keep.        
There is an estimated shortfall of 2.5 billion euros, or $3.3 billion, in the country’s social security funds for the year. And Greece is peering into an even larger chasm, an 11 billion euro financing gap that its international creditors have said the country will face as its debt payments come due over the next two years.        
A third foreign bailout, on top of the total 240 billion euro in bailouts given to Greece since 2010, is now assumed to be necessary.        
No wonder Greek trade unions and labor experts are warning that, despite the supposed red line, further pension cuts are likely. The concerns brought thousands of Greeks to the streets of Athens on Wednesday, calling attention to a two-day strike by civil servants, whose salaries and pensions have already been cut by 30 percent over the last three years. The strike was called to protest the government’s plans for thousands of forced transfers and layoffs in the Civil Service, but fears about pensions were in the air.        
“Just let them try and cut our pensions again,” said Maria Vassilopoulou, a 45-year-old nurse taking part in the protest. “They’ll have a riot on their hands.”        
The Greek labor minister, Yiannis Vroutsis, denied over the weekend that pensions would be withheld or cut. “I want to reassure people that their pensions will not be touched,” he said. “Families can make their plans feeling safe and secure.”        
But retirees are on edge. Stathis Meltakis, a 65-year-old car mechanic who retired this year, has been counting on a monthly payment of 850 euros from the country’s biggest pension fund for private sector workers, IKA, which provides health coverage to 5.5 million people and pensions to more than 800,000. But last week, the union representing IKA workers warned of cuts of 10 to 30 percent in pensions next year.        
“I’ve no idea when I’ll get it or how long the checks will keep coming,” Mr. Meltakis said. “You can’t be sure of anything anymore.”        
With Greece still not meeting the financial targets set by its international creditors, labor unions and economists worry that public pensions and state social security spending, which this year will total 18 billion euros, could be reduced again.        
“Basically, the pension system is collapsing,” said Savas Robolis, a prominent Greek labor economist who leads the research institute of the private workers’ union, the General Confederation of Greek Workers. He said that the funds’ decline was long in the making, after years of mismanagement, but that the country’s debt crisis dealt the final blow.        
With unemployment at a record 28 percent, fewer workers are paying into the funds, which have been sapped, too, by the early retirements of thousands of civil servants scrambling to escape forced transfers and layoffs.        
Mr. Robolis’s report called for growth-enhancing measures to increase the size of the Greek work force. Currently, only one Greek works for every two who do not. He also warned of the need to find ways of bolstering social security revenue.        
Of immediate concern is how to plug the social security funds’ estimated deficit for this year of 2.5 billion euros.        
Unlike the country’s banks, Greece’s pension funds were not recapitalized after a 50 percent write-down of private Greek debt last year, part of the country’s second bailout. The funds, as a result, came out of the bailout with a loss of 12 billion euros.        
Debts owed to IKA — mostly by employers delinquent on their social security contributions — ballooned to 8 billion euros, from 4.8 billion euros in 2010, the union representing IKA workers said. The union’s warning was followed by reports in the Greek media that IKA borrowed 150 million euros from the state to pay pensions in October.

Hou Yifan, a former women’s world chess champion, took a big step toward regaining the title on Wednesday as she won Game 6 of her title match with Anna Ushenina, the reigning champion. The match is being held in Taizhou, China.        


Each player earns one point for a victory and half a point for a draw. After six games, Ms. Hou leads 4½ to 1½. The winner will be the first player to amass 5½ points.        
The champion will earn 120,000 euros, about $160,000, and the runner-up 80,000 euros, about $106,000.        
Ms. Hou, 19, a Chinese grandmaster, won the title in 2010 and defended it in 2011. But in 2012, she lost in the second round of a 64-player elimination championship tournament that was eventually won by Ms. Ushenina, 28, a Ukrainian grandmaster.        
Ms. Hou earned the right to challenge Ms. Ushenina this year by winning the 2011-12 Women’s Grand Prix, a series of six tournaments featuring most of the world’s best female players.        
Though Ms. Ushenina is the reigning champion, she was the underdog at the start of the match, as she is ranked No. 17 in the world among women, and Ms. Hou is No. 2. The way that the match has unfolded has underscored a recurrent criticism of elimination tournaments as a method for selecting a champion: the best player does not always win.        
An exceptional feature of the current match is that Ms. Hou has won all of her games when she has played Black, which is usually disadvantageous, because White moves first.        
Ms. Ushenina’s problems have not been in the opening phases of the games, where she has generally achieved small advantages. Rather, she has consistently made miscalculations later in the games, or missed possible moves in complicated positions.        
That is what happened on Wednesday. She blundered on Move 33, which allowed Ms. Hou to push a pawn, attacking Ms. Ushenina’s queen. That pawn kept moving forward, and when Ms. Ushenina resigned on Move 40, it was because the pawn was about to promote to a queen, after which Ms. Hou would have had an overwhelming material superiority.        
Game 7 is scheduled for Friday, and Ms. Hou will be White. If she wins, the match will be over.

ROME — Ever the unpredictable showman, Silvio Berlusconi used a special televised address on Wednesday to defiantly stake a claim for a continued place at the heart of Italian politics. Perhaps, though, it was what he did not say that spoke loudest: not once did he discuss his party’s earlier threats to bring down Italy’s fragile coalition government.        


For weeks Italy has hovered at the edge of a political crisis centered on Mr. Berlusconi, the powerful former prime minister whose center-right People of Freedom party is a crucial partner in the awkward coalition government. His loyalists had vowed to pull the party’s support for the government if a special parliamentary commission voted to expel Mr. Berlusconi from his current Senate seat because of his recent conviction for tax fraud.        
But with Italy mired in a prolonged recession, and European leaders warning that political instability in Rome could threaten the health of the entire 17-nation euro zone, Mr. Berlusconi released a taped video message on Wednesday evening, broadcast on Italian television, in which he never discussed withdrawing his support for the government — even as the parliamentary panel resumed deliberations on his fate shortly after the broadcast.        
“He has chosen not to bring down the government,” said Roberto D’Alimonte, a leading political analyst in Rome. “It is not in his interest.”        
Mr. Berlusconi, a media mogul who has dominated Italian politics since the 1990s, also used his video address to restart the Forza Italia political party that first carried him to prominence.        
He seemed to acknowledge the likelihood that in the coming weeks he will be stripped of office. “I will always be with you, at your side, expelled or not,” he said during the 16-minute address. “You can be in politics even without being in Parliament. It’s not the seat that makes a leader, but popular consensus.”        
The release of the video followed 48 hours of swirling rumors about what Mr. Berlusconi might do before Wednesday evening’s meeting of the Senate panel, which concluded with a preliminary rejection of an appeal that he be allowed to remain in the Senate. The special commission is not likely to take final action until next month.        
Mr. Berlusconi’s political future has been uncertain since August, when Italy’s highest court upheld a conviction against him for tax fraud, a verdict he has bitterly criticized. He is expected to begin serving a reduced, one-year sentence in the middle of next month, most likely under house arrest or through community service.        
“I am not guilty,” he said in his message on Wednesday. “I am innocent. I am absolutely innocent.”        
The tax fraud conviction set in motion a chain of events that many analysts believe could end Mr. Berlusconi’s political career. The deliberations to expel him from the Senate are based on a 2012 law that bars anyone with such a conviction from holding public office for several years. His advocates have argued either that the law is unconstitutional or that it should not be applied because the tax case originated before it was enacted.        
For years, Mr. Berlusconi maneuvered through Italy’s legal system, despite corruption cases and sex scandals and other problems. He has portrayed himself as a victim of a zealous, politically biased judiciary, but his critics have scoffed at such claims and say that now, finally, he can no longer manipulate the system.        
“The political chickens of the last 20 years have come home to roost,” wrote Giovanni Orsina, the author of a new biography of Mr. Berlusconi, in Wednesday’s La Stampa, a leading Italian newspaper.        
Guglielmo Epifani, secretary of the Democratic Party, Italy’s largest center-left movement, described Mr. Berlusconi’s speech as “disconcerting” and “irresponsible,” while warning that the attacks against the judiciary risked “aggravating problems, whereas we need cohesion and good government,” according to ANSA, an Italian news agency.        
Mr. Berlusconi does seem increasingly pushed against a wall. He must decide by Oct. 15 how he intends to serve his one-year sentence in the tax case; many analysts say they believe he will remain under house arrest at his lavish villa outside Milan, though it is unclear if he will be allowed to meet people and communicate with the outside world. It is also possible he may choose some form of community service.        
An appeals court in Milan is expected to decide in October how many years Mr. Berlusconi, 76, will be barred from holding or seeking public office, based on the tax conviction.        
Finally, Italy’s highest court ruled this week that Mr. Berlusconi’s holding company, Fininvest, must pay a business rival roughly $675 million in damages in connection with a corruption case from the 1990s.        
In a statement released Wednesday, Marina Berlusconi, his daughter, considered a possible political heir, sharply criticized the damages verdict as “a slap at justice, but also a shameful and cowardly slap at a great business group and to the thousands of good people who work for it.”

FRANKFURT — The German engineering company Siemens is appointing the co-chief executive of the business software maker SAP to its board to replace Josef Ackermann, who resigned after the board’s decision to push out the company’s chief executive, Peter Löscher.        


The appointment was one of several changes in top Siemens management announced on Wednesday as the company tries to move past the upheaval surrounding Mr. Löscher’s departure in July.        
Mr. Ackermann, 65, will be replaced by Jim Hagemann Snabe, who remains the top executive at SAP, but has said he plans to leave that post next year for a seat on that company’s board.        
Mr. Ackermann, the former head of Deutsche Bank and one of Germany’s best-known business figures, left the Siemens board last week, citing “questions of style and fairness” in the company’s dealings after the board had Mr. Löscher removed. German news reports said Mr. Ackermann had opposed the board’s decision to oust Mr. Löscher and replace him with Joe Kaeser, then the company’s chief financial officer, after Siemens missed several profit targets.        
On Wednesday, Siemens named Ralf P. Thomas to succeed Mr. Kaeser as chief financial officer. Mr. Thomas has been the finance chief of the company’s industry division.        
Siemens is a pillar of the German economy, and its boardroom turmoil drew the attention of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who thought it was important for the company to “return to calm waters,” according to her spokesman. The company, based in Munich, has 370,000 employees worldwide and makes heavy-duty industrial goods, including power turbines, locomotives and medical imaging devices. It is a rival to General Electric.        
The chairman of the Siemens board, Gerhard Cromme, said Mr. Snabe, 47, would bring knowledge of software and computer technology.        
“In view of the growing strategic importance of digitalization for Siemens’s core businesses, we are adding to the technology and software competence of the supervisory board,” Mr. Cromme said in a statement. “We are gaining an internationally respected expert in this area.”

A former bank vice president pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a fraud charge, admitting he helped former executives of Olympus carry out a fraud involving several hundred million dollars that deceived investors into thinking the company was stronger financially than it was.         
The former banker, Chan Ming Fon, 50, pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Manhattan to federal conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He said he helped the executives as they misrepresented the financial condition of Olympus, a maker of medical devices and cameras, from at least 2004 through 2010 while he worked at two international financial institutions.        
“I acknowledge that my conduct was wrong,” Mr. Chan told Judge Laura Taylor Swain.        
Mr. Chan, a Taiwanese citizen and Singapore resident, was arrested in December in Los Angeles. He was expected to remain in the Los Angeles area after posting $1.5 million cash as part of his $3 million bail.        
Prosecutors said Mr. Chan managed a fund that held a bond investment portfolio belonging to Olympus. The government said Olympus executives directed Mr. Chan to transfer the portfolio to an Olympus-controlled entity, making the company appear stronger financially than it was.        
In a plea deal with the government that requires his cooperation, Mr. Chan acknowledged that he provided false and misleading information about the investment portfolio to Olympus’s auditor, misleading investors into thinking the portfolio remained in safe and secure bonds.        
Mr. Chan received more than $10 million in compensation for cooperating with the corrupt executives.        
At the time of his arrest, the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, said Mr. Chan “was handsomely paid to play an international shell game with hundreds of millions of dollars of assets in order to allow Olympus to keep a massive accounting fraud going for years.”        
A year ago, Olympus, its former president and two other executives pleaded guilty in Tokyo to criminal charges related to a two-decade $1.7 billion accounting fraud aimed at covering up huge investment losses.

CAIRO — Mohamed Morsi, Egypt’s ousted president, has spoken by telephone with his family twice in recent days, their first contacts since he was detained by the military on July 3, his lawyer told The Associated Press on Wednesday.        


The lawyer, Mustafa Attiyah, told the news agency that the first call took place last week and the second one two days later, and that Mr. Morsi had said he was in good health. The report gave no dates for either call, and Mr. Attiyah did not respond to phone calls. Mr. Morsi’s family has not spoken publicly for a month.        
Mr. Morsi, 62, has been held at an undisclosed location since being removed from office. The last report of contact with him came in early August, when the military allowed visits by diplomats from the European Union and the African Union. At the end of August, the authorities announced the first legal charges against him, accusing him of inciting murder last December by stoking clashes outside the presidential palace between thousands of his supporters and opponents.        
It was unclear why Egypt’s new authorities allowed Mr. Morsi to contact his family, but the news comes as his ouster appears increasingly irreversible.        
His reinstatement, at least for a short transition, was initially the goal of a protest movement led by his Islamist allies in the Muslim Brotherhood. But that hope has diminished as the authorities have killed hundreds of protesters in mass shootings and arrested thousands of Islamists, including most of the Brotherhood’s leadership.        
Although smaller demonstrations continue in Cairo and elsewhere, the protests are increasingly focused on opposing the new government’s authoritarianism rather than on demanding Mr. Morsi’s return. Few protesters carry his picture; most hold posters of a four-fingered salute, signifying the biggest mass shooting of Islamist protesters. That occurred at a sit-in in Rabaa Square, whose name sounds like the Arabic word for “fourth.”        
It was not clear if Mr. Morsi has had any access to a lawyer, and no trial date has been set.        
There is no public record of any statements Mr. Morsi made that might qualify as incitement to murder. In the battle in question, his supporters were trying to defend his palace from thousands of angry opponents; the police did nothing to intervene. Both sides fought with rocks, fire bombs and at least a few firearms, and more of Mr. Morsi’s supporters than his opponents died in the fighting.        
Egyptian state news media have reported that prosecutors are weighing other charges, including allegations that Mr. Morsi insulted the judiciary by accusing judges of helping President Hosni Mubarak rig the 2005 parliamentary elections. Mr. Morsi is also under investigation for his escape from prison in the first days of the uprising against Mr. Mubarak, when security forces rounded up Islamist opposition leaders to try to quell the revolt.

RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s highest court on Wednesday allowed a new round of appeals in a trial over a vast vote-buying scheme, a decision that may allow senior political figures in the ruling Workers Party to maneuver out of hard jail time for their actions in what may be Brazil’s biggest corruption scandal.        


Ending months of suspense, after defendants were found guilty and sentenced to prison by the same court in November 2012 in what had been celebrated then as a watershed moment, the justices ruled by 6-5 to reopen crucial aspects of the trial. So far, no one has gone to prison in the scandal, which emerged in 2005.        
“The move sets a troubling precedent by raising concerns over a domino effect in many other corruption cases involving powerful figures,” said Ivar Hartmann, a professor of law at Fundação Getúlio Vargas, a top Brazilian university.        
Even before the trial, it was remarkably rare for politicians in Brazil to go to prison after being found guilty of crimes like corruption, kidnapping and employing slave labor, partly because of the special judicial standing enjoyed by about 700 political figures, including senior cabinet ministers and all 594 members of Congress. This standing requires their cases to be heard only in the high court, which is already bogged down by thousands of other cases each year.        
The system produces years of delays in judging politicians charged with serious crimes. Legal experts said such cases could now drag on indefinitely after a ruling by the high court justices on Wednesday, which allowed appeals of their own votes in these trials.        
The televised debate over the appeals within the court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal, produced heated moments in recent weeks. Justice Gilmar Mendes said the court was inviting mockery as a “juvenile tribunal of irresponsible people,” while another justice, Ricardo Lewandowski, argued that the court was merely giving defendants the right to a new appeal.        
Given the delays that have already characterized the trial, the court’s discussion of the appeals could realistically drag on for years, Helenita Acioli, the interim prosecutor general, said this month.        
That may benefit figures like José Dirceu de Oliveira e Silva, who was chief of staff for Brazil’s former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and sentenced to nearly 11 years in prison for his role in orchestrating the vote-buying scheme, called the mensalão, or big monthly allowance, after the regular payments made to legislators in exchange for their votes.        
The appeals involve a rare legal procedure in which close votes on the high court can be held again. The appeals, which are thought to have originated in the 16th-century legal system of Portugal, Brazil’s former colonial ruler, were abolished there in the 1930s. Few Brazilians had even heard of the appeals until the high court considered them in the mensalão trial.        
While few convictions are expected to be overturned, defendants are seeking less stringent prison conditions, including arrangements that allow convicts to leave prison during the day to work. Some legal experts held open the possibility that some defendants could avoid jail time altogether if the trial endured long; crimes committed about a decade ago could be exceeded by the statute of limitations.        
“The stain on their reputations remains,” said Matthew M. Taylor, a scholar at American University in Washington who specializes in Brazil’s legal system. He said the latest twist in their trial was “more troubling for what it says about Brazil’s courts and their inability to effectively and expeditiously tackle widespread corruption within the political system.”

It used to be that if you could not afford to pay a big medical bill, your doctor or hospital might let you pay it over time, a little bit each month.        


The Holston Medical Group, for instance, a large, multispecialty physician group in Tennessee, had one plan with such low payments that it would have taken the patient 115 years to pay a bill off.        
But the days of such informal arrangements may be numbered. You can still find installment plans, but now they are often more structured agreements, managed by a company hired to oversee your account.        
Hospitals say they are turning to such businesses because, as insurance plans shift more costs to patients, providers are stuck trying to collect money they are owed. (Hospitals provided about $41 billion in uncompensated care in 2011, according to the American Hospital Association.) Some hospitals have even come under fire for heavy-handed practices, like putting representatives of collection agencies in emergency rooms to get patients to pay up front.        
Enter services like CarePayment and ClearBalance, which promote no-interest payment plans to hospitals and patients as flexible and “patient friendly.”        
“Hospitals are very sensitive to the fact that out-of-pocket costs for patients are increasing drastically,” said Craig Froude, chief executive of CarePayment. “They’re trying to figure out how to adapt.”        
Details vary depending on the terms negotiated between the hospital and the payment company. In some cases, hospitals offer the plans as an option. Other hospitals automatically enroll patients who do not pay a bill within 90 days. Typically, the companies offer plans of as long as two years, and sometimes as long as five years, with no interest or fees for patients. Payments are usually based on a percentage of the total bill, with minimums around $25 a month.        
The hospital pays a fee to the company in exchange for getting its payment up front. The company then collects the payments. Some offer automatic deductions, and let patients check their accounts online.        
The benefit is that hospitals may get more of the money they are owed than they would otherwise, even after factoring in fees to the outside company. The patient gets time to pay a big bill, and avoids the damage to a credit record that would occur if the debt were sent to collection. That can still happen. If the patient does not pay, the company sends the account back to the hospital for review.        
A patients who uses such a plan may receive a card bearing the names of the hospital and the payment firm, but it is not a credit card. The companies say they may conduct a “soft inquiry” on a patient’s credit report, which does not affect the credit score. A patient whose score falls below a certain level will still be put on a plan, but the company will not pay the hospital until the patient has made a few payments on time.        
A patient’s payment record generally is not reported to credit bureaus. Mitch Patridge, chief executive of CSI Financial Services, which is based in San Diego and offers ClearBalance, said it gave patients the option of having their payment history reported to credit bureaus if they chose, to help build credit.        
Jeff Costello, chief financial officer at Beacon Health System in South Bend, Ind., said it had tried offering short-term payment plans and even low-interest loans through a local bank, but “patients didn’t like paying interest for medical bills.”        
The system began using CarePayment’s no-interest plan in 2009 and it has been well received by patients, he said; some who use it once ask for it up front when seeking additional care. Patients can add new bills to the account, he said, and have their monthly payment recalculated.        
Here are questions to ask about medical installment plans:        
■ Will I have to pay interest if I don’t pay off the bill by a certain date? 
Some providers, including dentists and eye care outlets, offer true credit card financing. They may offer zero-percent rates, but the rate can skyrocket if you are late or stop paying. Hospitals say their plans are different and offer no (or, in some cases, very low) interest. But make sure you understand the details of any plan you accept and get a copy of the agreement in writing, so you know what happens if you cannot pay.        
■ Can I still get financial assistance if I agree to a payment plan? 
You should always ask first about financial help, to reduce your overall bill, said Mark Rukavina, a specialist on medical debt. Under the Affordable Care Act, nonprofit hospitals will have to develop written policies on their “charity” care and collection practices. Many for-profit hospitals have written policies, too. You should ask.        
■ Should I use a no-interest plan, even if I can pay in full?        
Some providers offer significant discounts if you pay in full within 30 days. If you can do so, that might be a better option.

Looters plundered stores in Acapulco on Wednesday as it struggled to recover from a flood wrought by a tropical storm that has moved up the coast and is threatening another resort area, Cabo San Lucas. The death toll from the storm, and another this week on the Gulf coast, which is also threatened by yet another storm, reached at least 80 people. But a full accounting is yet to come from several towns cut off by mudslides; in Atoyac de Álvarez, a small municipality in Guerrero State, about 50 people remained unaccounted for. An airlift of thousands of tourists stranded in Acapulco continued Wednesday.

WASHINGTON — More than 50 New Yorkers active in anti-hunger efforts, including leaders of food banks and soup kitchens, made their way to Washington last week for a day of lobbying. On Tuesday, the celebrity chef Tom Colicchio, a board member of the group Food Policy Action, met with House Democrats to highlight the need for programs to address hunger.         
The advocates’ efforts came as the Republican-controlled House was expected to take up a food stamp bill this week. The measure would cut about $40 billion from the program, which Republican lawmakers say has grown too large. They also said it is rife with fraud and abuse, although Agriculture Department data show that the program has lower fraud rates than farm subsidies like crop insurance.        
The bill would also cut off food aid after three months to recipients between the ages of 18 and 50 if they cannot find work or enroll in a job placement program. Exceptions would be granted for those with children who are still minors.        
Food stamps have been part of the farm bill, long a bipartisan piece of legislation, since 1973. But because of an ideological divide, lawmakers have been trying for at least two years to agree on a new five-year bill that would continue financing for farm and nutrition programs.        
There has been disagreement over continuing subsidies to farmers, who are earning near-record incomes as a group. But the debate over food stamps has been more heated. Food stamps account for nearly 80 percent of the farm bill’s costs, and conservatives in the House — who wanted steeper cuts to food stamps than the proposed $20 billion — killed a broad farm bill in June. It was an embarrassing defeat for Speaker John A. Boehner. The next month, House leaders split the bill’s farm and nutrition sections into separate measures, passing the farm legislation over Democrats’ objections.        
Conservatives say the bill now under consideration would make much-needed changes to the food stamp program.        
“While we still have a long way to go in reforming both food stamp and farm programs, this is a victory for those who believe that we should measure success by the number of families who get back on their feet, not by how much government increases spending year after year,” Representative Marlin Stutzman, Republican of Indiana, said in a statement on Monday.        
But advocates say the cuts would leave millions of people hungry. Numerous studies, including research by the Congressional Budget Office, show that as many as four million people could lose their benefits under the bill. About 47 million people receive food assistance under the current program.        
A Census Bureau report released Tuesday found that food stamps have helped lift about four million people above the poverty line and have kept tens of millions more from becoming poorer.        
Anti-hunger activists hope their efforts over the past few weeks will persuade lawmakers to vote against the bill, since it is unclear if there are enough Republican votes to pass it. Democrats are solidly opposed, and President Obama said Wednesday that he would veto legislation that contained the cuts.        
“Charity can’t do it alone,” said Margarette Purvis, the president of the Food Bank for New York City. “Our network of 1,000 charities are experienced and robust, but we simply can’t make up for a cut of this magnitude.”        
Former Senators Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, also called on lawmakers to stop playing politics with hunger in an op-ed article published in The Los Angeles Times on Monday.        
“The latest proposal from the House is an about-face on our progress fighting hunger,” they wrote. “If Congress lets this bill fall victim to the misguided and detrimental partisan politics we face today, the results for families and children challenged with hunger will be severe.”        
Farm groups, which opposed splitting the original bill, have been largely silent on the upcoming vote on food stamps.        
Dale Moore, executive director of public policy for the American Farm Bureau Federation, the nation’s largest farm group, said it had not taken a position on the bill. “It’s out of our hands,” he said.        
Even if Republicans manage to pass the food stamp bill, it is unclear how the legislation would be received in the Senate, where some members have expressed opposition to the amount of food stamp cuts in the House bill.        
Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and chairwoman of the Agriculture Committee, on Wednesday called the House bill a relentless assault on the poor and hungry. “The House bill will not see the light of day in the Senate,” she said.        
A Senate bill passed in May would cut $4.5 billion from the program. Both chambers want to hammer out differences in their versions of the farm bill before agriculture programs expire. The current bill, passed in 2008 and extended last year, expires at the end of the month.

CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES is introducing a new advertising campaign on Monday that it hopes will help it recover from the negative publicity it received when its ship, the Triumph, caught fire last February and stranded passengers and crew in the Gulf of Mexico.         
The cruise line has not run any television advertising and only limited digital advertising since the fire, which stranded 4,200 passengers and crew members for five days and became a cause célebrè in the media. In 2010, another of the line’s 24 ships, the Splendor, also caught fire at sea.        
Robin Farley, who follows the cruise industry for UBS, said Carnival Cruise Lines “historically has been one of the strongest brands in the cruise sector.” She estimated that the line, one of 10 operated by the Carnival Corporation, represents 30 percent of its parent company’s total capacity and that before the Triumph accident, generated more than 30 percent of its profits. She also said the accident could lead to yield declines of 10 to 11 percent for the line this year.        
In recent years, advertising by Carnival, created by the Boston office of Arnold Worldwide, part of Havas, has focused on the “fun” aspects of its cruises. The tagline on some TV spots was “Fun for all, all for fun.”        
The new advertising follows a series of actions undertaken by the line after the Triumph accident, including a $300 million program to upgrade emergency power capabilities, fire safety technology and other systems; outreach to travel agents, an important source of business; and a vacation guarantee program that gives dissatisfied passengers a 110 percent refund. Jim Berra, chief marketing officer for Carnival, said additional innovations in dining, entertainment and programs for young passengers will be introduced starting this fall.        
“Once the brand perception took a hit post-Triumph, we felt the strongest and most credible voice to convey what a cruise experience is truly like is the voice of the guests,” Mr. Berra said.        
Thus, in July the line invited 10 people who are active on Instagram — interested in food and family issues, among other topics — to take a cruise during which they could shoot photos. These were posted live on a Web site, Carnival.com/momenttracker.        
In July, the line also asked former passengers and employees to submit photos and videos, via Facebook and Instagram, they had taken on Carnival cruises; it received more than 31,000 pieces of this content.        
More than 500 videos and photos, including some by the Instagram activists who sailed in July, are featured in a new TV spot, which shows individuals walking down a street, in a field and along a boardwalk. All places where they walk are festooned with picture frames, which contain the user-generated imagery.        
The voice-over says, “We never forget the moments that matter. We hang them on our walls. We share them with everyone. And hold onto them forever.”        
The spot ends with an image of a Carnival cruise ship at sea and the voice-over concluding, “Since the day we first set sail, millions of lasting moments have been made with us. What will yours be?”        
A 60-second version of the TV spot will begin running Monday on prime-time network television shows like “How I Met Your Mother” and “Parks and Recreation,” as well as on cable channels like Bravo, TLC and the Food Network. Digital and radio advertising with the same theme as the TV spot will also be created.        
Pete Johnson, co-executive creative director of the Boston office of Arnold Worldwide, said the new campaign’s theme was chosen because “we wanted to have a more emotive message,” to let viewers “see Carnival as a place where they can experience deep moments with family, friends and loved ones. We wanted to tell the story from cruisers’ point of view, to be as authentic as possible.”        
Mr. Berra said the campaign is aimed at “outgoing, engaged, optimistic individuals,” as well as at “decision-making moms.”        
The timing of it is not coincidental: Mr. Berra said the campaign was “designed to accelerate recovery in advance of the wave season in the first quarter of 2014,” the first quarter of the calendar year when Carnival typically receives approximately 30 percent of its annual bookings.        
Mr. Berra said Carnival would spend more than $25 million on advertising in the fourth quarter of 2013, some of which will be money the line did not spend when it suspended TV advertising after the Triumph accident. According to Kantar Media, Carnival annually has spent from $26.9 million on advertising in 2012 to $71.3 million in 2010.        
Ms. Farley said it “makes sense” that Carnival used social media to create its new advertising, since comments on social media by stranded Triumph passengers “magnified the experiences of a few in a way that overshadowed what the brand stood for such a long time.”        
Other travel and marketing experts were highly critical of the campaign. John Greening, a professor of branding and marketing communications at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, said the campaign was premature. Carnival “needs to let more time go by. It’s too soon to be promoting itself. They might do more P.R. efforts than advertising,” he said.        
Maurice Schweitzer, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who does research in trust recovery, said the campaign was lacking “evidence of any new procedures and processes that make Carnival a more effective, safe and competent operator.”        
Henry Harteveldt, travel analyst for Hudson Crossing, called the TV spot “trite and lacking in authenticity and credibility.”        
“It’s almost as if Carnival is hoping that by watching its commercial filled with” smiling people, “consumers’ memories will be magically erased of any memories regarding the series of unfortunate events that the line recently experienced,” he said.

OTTAWA — Commuters were shocked and investigators were at a loss to explain why a double-decker transit bus drove past a warning light in Ottawa on Wednesday morning, crashed through safety barriers and plowed into a passenger train, killing six bus passengers and injuring 34 others.        


No one aboard the Via Rail Canada passenger train, which was derailed, was hurt, the authorities said.        
The accident took place at the end of the morning rush hour under clear skies. Several passengers aboard the packed OC Transpo bus, which can carry about 90 people, told reporters that while it was clear they were going to crash into the train, the driver seemed to brake only immediately before hitting the train locomotive.        
“People started screaming ‘Stop! Stop!’ because they could see the train coming down the track,” a university student, Tanner Trepanier, told The Canadian Press news agency.        
An onlooker, Mark Cogan, told reporters the driver “went through the guard rail and just hammered the train and then it was just mayhem.”        
Witnesses said bodies of the dead and some of the injured were thrown from the bus, and a broken barrier from the crossing, not far from the Fallowfield station, could be seen under its wreckage.        
The bus was traveling on a special road network reserved for transit vehicles. An original plan for the crossing, near the suburban neighborhood of Barr Haven, had called for an underpass rather than a level crossing. But when groundwater problems inflated the plan’s costs, the city got permission to use crossing gates that block all traffic lanes.        
Speculation was widespread that the driver, whom his union identified as Dave Woodard and who was among the dead, had suffered a heart attack or some other medical emergency immediately before the crash or that the accident may have been caused by mechanical failure.        
Passengers who had boarded just before the crash said Mr. Woodard had seemed to be in good health. The union said he had worked as a bus driver for about 10 years and had a flawless record.        
Since the double-decker buses were introduced about a year ago, some drivers have complained about the brakes.        
Jean Laporte, the chief operating officer of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which is leading the investigation, said that it may take months to determine a cause.        
The accident is the second deadly episode involving railways in Canada this summer. On July 6, a runaway freight train carrying crude oil derailed in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, killing 47 people and destroying its downtown in a series of fiery blasts.

Metro,"










They quietly buried the man who had no business dying.        


The next day, friends wearing fairy wings extended their own goodbyes.        
Intermingled glimpses were shared. He was infectiously kind, cared deeply for his mother, revered steam locomotives, was enthralled with comic books and fairies. A modest life that stayed out of the public face, unnoticed and unremarked upon, the way it is with most lives. His unfortunate end got him the attention.        
On the afternoon of Sept. 4, in Union Square, near the comic book store and gothic shop that he frequented, Jeffrey Babbitt, 62, was approached by an assailant who punched him in the face in what authorities deemed a random attack. The police said the attacker declared that he wanted to “punch the first white man” he saw.        
Mr. Babbitt fell and struck his head hard on the pavement. He died on Sept. 9. The police arrested Martin Redrick, 40, a black man with a criminal past.        
The funeral service was brief and small. It was just a graveside ceremony on Tuesday at the Beth El Cemetery in Paramus, N.J., where the family had a plot. A half-dozen mourners assembled under a luminous sky. There was his mother, Lucille Babbitt, 94; Reva Weiss, a family friend who accompanied her; Gwen Billig, who knew him as a fellow member of a railroad club, New York Railroad Enthusiasts; a casual acquaintance; and finally two strangers, spurred to come after reading about his death.        
Ms. Billig showed a necklace with a fairy clipped to it. She said Mr. Babbitt had given it to her. For no occasion. He did things like that.        
Mrs. Babbitt is a small woman with plaintive eyes, her vision and hearing diminished, her mind plenty sharp. She had been good and bad of late, and just the night before she was agonizing over how she was going to endure this day.        
By no law of mercy should a mother have to bury her children. Lucille Babbitt was forced to do it for a second time. Last summer, she buried her daughter, lost to cancer. She was in the Paramus ground, beside her father and awaiting her brother.        
Mr. Babbitt, a retired train hostler, the person who moves engines around railroad yards, lived with his mother in a brick apartment building in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. He regularly visited Union Square, where he would linger for hours. He was well liked by the employees at his haunts: the Forbidden Planet comic store, the Gothic Renaissance store and the Halloween Adventure shop.        
Some of these workers wanted to make the funeral. The logistics were difficult. So they would honor him the next day.        
Beside the grave, Rabbi William Golub broke the quietude. He said, “This is like a puzzle, like a puzzle you find in a store and you open it up and it’s a mess.” He added: “Life is a puzzle. We don’t understand anything that is going on, especially something like this.”        
He said, “A perfectly normal, functioning man going about his business is struck down by a senseless hate crime.”        
New Jersey earth was shoveled over the coffin and that was that.        
In the late afternoon on Wednesday at the entrance to Union Square Park, his other world flared to life. A scattering of friends amassed, wings on their back in deference to Mr. Babbitt’s fairy fascination.        
Raine Anakanu, the assistant manager at Gothic Renaissance, was especially fond of Mr. Babbitt and had arranged the service. “He saw the world in a different way,” Mr. Anakanu said. “The hidden magic in the world. The beauty in things.”        
Mr. Anakanu and his wife, Shonda Lynch, wore wings and held magic wands. They had a stash of spare wings for mourners wishing to adjust to the prearranged theme. Lauren Anderson, who also works at Gothic Renaissance, had made magical charms with Mr. Babbitt’s initials, available for the taking.        
“He was so sweet,” Ms. Lynch said of Mr. Babbitt. “The last time I actually saw him he kissed me on the cheek and ran away.”        
Diana Varga, who works at the Halloween store, said, “He would always talk about how fairies would make him happy and make him feel young.”        
Mr. Anakanu asked one woman if she would like some wings, and she said, “To eat?”        
Winged attendance was moderate and sporadic. Competition was severe in the park. Line dancers were performing behind them, as well as the musicians, as well as the rows of chess and backgammon games, and the guy offering free hugs.        
Mr. Babbitt had been at Gothic Renaissance on the day he was attacked. He often bought fairy figurines and ornaments there. At Forbidden Planet, he purchased comic books. His favorite series was Grimm Fairy Tales, modern horror versions of classic fairy tales, infused with dark humor, that are published by Zenescope Entertainment. Having learned of his devotion, Zenescope plans to dedicate a coming issue to Mr. Babbitt.        
Mr. Babbitt traveled to a lot of comic book, science fiction and fairy conventions, including the big FaerieCon festival. One of his important life moments, he had told Mr. Anakanu, was when he was baptized with fairy dust by Twig the Fairy, a character who appears at conventions and Renaissance fairs.        
Imagine if Twig the Fairy came to the little memorial. Mr. Anakanu made an attempt to see if the actress who plays Twig could somehow squeeze this in. She was busy in Minnesota.

Business,"










LOS ANGELES — For her detractors, and there are many, the turnabout is delicious: Nikki Finke, the blogger who squeezed Hollywood with her rabid trade reporting for Deadline.com, is now being squeezed. Jay Penske, the media entrepreneur who bought her Web site in 2009, has Ms. Finke in a difficult spot.         
For her supporters, and there are many, the public, yearlong spat between Ms. Finke and Mr. Penske — it centers on his purchase of Variety — has been an ill-timed distraction that has made her site bland. Ms. Finke says she no longer has time to report her signature incendiary pieces because she is too busy “scrambling to keep Deadline together with chicken wire.” The Penske Media Corporation, she contends, has not delivered promised resources — an assertion that a Penske spokeswoman called “patently not true.”        
For Mr. Penske and the broader business community, the tit-for-tat entanglement may simply boil down to another example of the corporate difficulties associated with brands that are so closely linked to one personality, especially one as ferocious as Ms. Finke.        
Most people in Hollywood are focused on more pressing matters than internal squabbling at a trade publication. But at least in some corners of the show business capital, the Finke-Penske fight has turned into a lurid spectator sport. Ms. Finke has at times taken to answering her phone weeping; at least one studio executive said he privately pressed Mr. Penske to resolve the matter.        
Ms. Finke said on Wednesday that she hoped a resolution could come by Sunday, when she is scheduled to “live snark” the Emmy Awards for Deadline.        
An effort to team with an outside investor to help her buy back Deadline from Mr. Penske recently ended in failure, she said. She declined to name the investor, but a private equity executive with knowledge of the matter identified him as Jahm Najafi, who runs a Phoenix-based private equity firm. The executive spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. A spokesman for Mr. Najafi had no comment.        
The standoff illustrates the problems that can pop up when one individual develops a presence big enough to define an entire news brand, said Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard. “On one hand, there is The Economist approach where they don’t have bylines, to incentivize the magazine brand over staffers,” he said. “But personality and individual standing mean a lot online.”        
Ms. Finke said she sees two options: Stay under revised conditions or leave and start over at NikkiFinke.com, a Web site she owns.        
“If I was truthful and brutal before, I want to be 50 times more truthful and brutal,” she said of a potential new site, which she otherwise declined to describe. “Maybe I’ll also have a countdown clock: How many days until The Hollywood Reporter has an issue devoted to moguls and their cats,” Ms. Finke added in a trademark swipe at the rival trade outlet. (The Reporter recently put out a pets issue.)        
Ms. Finke has a contract with Penske Media through 2016; she said it includes windows that allow her to exit.        
Mr. Penske had no comment. The spokeswoman for Penske Media, Lauren Gullion, wrote in an e-mail, “Nikki’s multiyear contract with Deadline is not something that ends soon, and it would unconditionally prohibit her starting any other Web site.”        
Ms. Gullion said of Ms. Finke’s assertion that she worked with an investor to buy Deadline, “We have not received any offers from third parties to purchase the Deadline.com business.”        
Ms. Finke, speaking from Hawaii, said Penske Media had fallen far short of providing the resources — more reporters, editors and business-side managers — that Deadline requires. Ms. Gullion said: “This is patently not true. P.M.C. has continually made hires of top talent at Deadline ever since we acquired the business and in four years has grown the team.” She cited recent hires like Lisa de Moraes, who joined in June from The Washington Post.        
Aside from resources, Ms. Finke is pressing Mr. Penske, a son of the auto racing mogul Roger Penske, to make a sharp distinction between Variety and her site.        
“We are covering the same stories, pushing out the same e-mail alerts and there is little or no differentiation,” Ms. Finke said. Her solution, she said, would be to make Deadline the breaking news and commentary site and to have Variety focus on “analysis and deep dive.”        
Variety has been at the center of the dispute since October, when Mr. Penske bought the 108-year-old trade publication for about $25 million. He quickly said that Ms. Finke would have no say in Variety’s operations. Ms. Finke said she was told the opposite before the purchase, and has clearly chafed at the perceived snub as Mr. Penske has gone about giving Variety a major overhaul, not all of which has gone over well with print readers.        
Deadline’s Web site, heavy with exclusive morsels of casting news and executive comings and goings but notably no celebrity gossip, still attracts more monthly unique visitors than Variety.com. But Variety’s traffic has also soared. According to independent comScore figures, Variety, which has abolished its pay wall, had 2.2 million unique visitors in August, up from 320,000 in the same month last year. Deadline had 2.6 million, a 9 percent increase from a year earlier.        
(Ms. Finke cites higher internal numbers for Deadline.) For now, Ms. Finke insisted that she was eager to put the conflict behind her and return her focus to her colorful writing and reporting.        
“I miss it, Hollywood misses it, and the readers miss it,” she said.

ATHENS — The police raided the offices of Greece’s far-right Golden Dawn Party on Wednesday, and government officials scrambled for ways to clamp down on the group after thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in several Greek cities to protest the killing of an antifascist activist that the police attributed to a Golden Dawn sympathizer.        


In the most serious violence attributed to Golden Dawn since it gained power in Greece’s Parliament last year, a man who the police said admitted to being in the party was arrested after the fatal stabbing in an Athens suburb early on Wednesday of Pavlos Fyssas, 34, a leftist hip-hop singer who spoke out against the group.        
Mr. Fyssas, who used the stage name Killah P., was stabbed early Wednesday, just after midnight, as he left a cafe after watching a soccer match on television with friends. The police told the Greek news media that they received a phone call reporting that around 50 people with clubs were headed toward the cafe, and that officers who arrived on the scene saw two men fighting. The police said the suspect, identified as a 45-year old man, confessed to the killing. Mr. Fyssas’s funeral is scheduled for Thursday.        
A spokesman for Golden Dawn, Ilias Kasidiaris, told Parliament on Wednesday that the group was not involved. But leaders in Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s fragile government coalition signaled that they would tighten legal restrictions in an effort to curb the party.        
Golden Dawn’s popularity has climbed in political polls especially among a growing swath of Greeks who are increasingly angered by record joblessness, a steady flow of immigrants into the country and the less-than-successful struggle by mainstream parties to mend the effects of a devastating recession. But backlashes have also been mounting against Golden Dawn in recent months. Last week, thousands of Greeks protested in Athens after about 50 Golden Dawn members, wielding bats and crowbars, attacked members of the Communist Party as they hung posters for a youth festival in an Athens suburb, leaving nine people hospitalized with serious injuries. On Wednesday, those protesting Mr. Fyssas’s killing joined thousands of other Greeks who had already been marching to protest a restructuring of Greece’s education system.        
Mr. Samaras’s New Democracy Party issued a statement condemning the killing on Wednesday, calling it “the result of the Nazi belief of hatred nurtured and promoted by Golden Dawn.” In a speech earlier this week, Mr. Samaras warned of a “blind spot” in which extremist forces could gain steam in coming months “after the economy starts to turn, but before improvement is felt by people.” He added: “This will be the last chance for extremism to derail the process. It’s what makes the next few months critical.”        
Mr. Samaras was in Brussels on Tuesday extolling prospects for Greece’s beleaguered economy, which may need new rescue loans on top of two bailout packages. Greece’s creditors are scheduled to return to Athens next week, and Mr. Samaras told officials in Brussels that he would not impose any more austerity on Greek citizens.        
Painful cuts to salaries and pensions continue to take a toll on average Greeks and on the economy. The severity of a five-year recession eased slightly last month, when the economy shrank at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the three months to July, compared with a 5.6 percent decline in the first quarter. With talk of a Greek exit from the euro having faded, tourism surged this summer, giving the economy a needed jolt. Yet record unemployment of 26.9 percent, and nearly 60 percent for young people, has unleashed a wave of discontent for Golden Dawn to ride, helping it to rise further in political polls.        
Evangelos Venezelos, the leader of the Pasok Party, the main partner in Mr. Samaras’s coalition government, stopped just short on Wednesday of calling for Golden Dawn to be outlawed. “Golden Dawn uses violence as its main tool and must be treated as a criminal organization,” he said. “It has now gone beyond all limits. The state must intervene.”        
Greece’s public order minister, Nikos Dendias, on Wednesday urged the government to consider changing the law to define what constitutes a criminal gang. Such a move could box in the party, whose members — including lawmakers serving in Parliament — have been accused of carrying out numerous criminal acts, especially against immigrants.

Cleveland traded running back Trent Richardson to the Indianapolis Colts on Wednesday, a stunning move just a year after the Browns picked Richardson in the first round of the draft.        


Richardson was dealt for a first-round selection in next year’s draft, giving the Browns two first-round picks and 10 picks over all.        
Richardson, who rushed for 950 yards as a rookie despite playing most of last season with two broken ribs, gained 105 yards on 31 carries in Cleveland’s two losses to start this season.        
He lacked the explosiveness the Browns’ new leadership was apparently looking for, and it may not have helped that Richardson made clear that he wanted the ball more.        
The trade came on the same day that the team’s first-year coach, Rob Chudzinski, announced that the third-string quarterback Brian Hoyer would start Sunday against Minnesota. That move was surprising in itself: Hoyer was chosen over the backup, Jason Campbell, to fill in for Brandon Weeden, who is sidelined with a sprained right thumb.        
Campbell came off the bench Sunday at Baltimore after Weeden was hurt. Chudzinski did not guarantee that Weeden would get his job back.        
“I’m going to leave all the options open,” Chudzinski said. “Really, it’s a matter of where he’s at from a health standpoint and all that plays into it and where we’re at and how guys are playing as well.”        
In addition, the Browns demoted wide receiver Greg Little, and they were set to bring in the free-agent running back Willis McGahee for a physical and were planning to sign him if he passed. A two-time Pro Bowl pick, McGahee rushed for 731 yards in 10 games for Denver last season.        
Little, who has dropped several passes, was dropped himself: Chudzinski said Davone Bess and Josh Gordon, who is back from a two-game suspension, would start.        
The Browns’ chief executive, Joe Banner, said the decision to trade Richardson was in keeping with a plan to overhaul the team.        
“Right now, based on how we’re building this team for sustainable success, we’re going to be aggressive and do what it takes to assemble a team that consistently wins,” Banner said.        
BRONCOS PUT TACKLE ON I.R. Denver placed left tackle Ryan Clady on season-ending injured reserve.        
Clady hurt his left foot Sunday while the Broncos were trying to run out the clock in their win over the Giants. He will have surgery for what is being called a Lisfranc tear, which involves a separation of ligaments and joints in the foot.        
Chris Clark, a fifth-year journeyman, will take the place of Clady — the undisputed leader on the line — and make his first career start at left tackle Monday against Oakland.        
PACKERS CHOOSE STARKS With Eddie Lacy recovering from a concussion, James Starks will start at running back for Green Bay on Sunday against Cincinnati. Starks ran for a career-best 132 yards last weekend against Washington.        
TIGHT END OUT FOR SEASON Indianapolis tight end Dwayne Allen, who started all 16 regular-season games as a rookie last season, will miss the rest of the season because of a hip injury. Allen caught a touchdown pass in the Colts’ opener, against Oakland, but was inactive for Sunday’s loss to Miami. The Colts had hoped he would heal with rest, but doctors said surgery would be required.        
FITZGERALD MISSES PRACTICE Larry Fitzgerald (hamstring) sat out practice, and his status was uncertain for Arizona’s game Sunday at New Orleans. Coach Bruce Arians said that Fitzgerald wanted to practice but that he was overruled. The Cardinals’ starting running back, Rashard Mendenhall, who has a toe injury, also did not practice.        
JONES-DREW SITS OUT Jacksonville running back Maurice Jones-Drew was held out of practice as a precaution after his foot swelled up Wednesday morning. He strained a tendon in his left foot Sunday.        
TE’O BACK ON FIELD The San Diego rookie linebacker Manti Te’o practiced for the first time since injuring his right foot Aug. 8. Coach Mike McCoy declined to say whether Te’o would be activated for Sunday’s game at Tennessee.        
PUNISHMENT REDUCED Tampa Bay safety Dashon Goldson’s one-game suspension for a helmet-to-helmet hit was reduced to a $100,000 fine.        
Goldson was suspended for one game without pay Monday for flagrant and repeat violations of N.F.L. safety rules prohibiting hits to the head and neck area of defenseless players.        
The N.F.L. fined Tennessee safety Bernard Pollard $42,000 for such a hit on Houston wide receiver Andre Johnson. The hit left Johnson with a concussion.        
JETS DEFENDER NEARING RETURN Jets outside linebacker Quinton Coples, who fractured his ankle during the team’s second preseason game, said he hoped to make his season debut Sunday against Buffalo.        
The Jets have marveled at his swift recovery from an operation on Aug. 20, and it is possible that Coples, who practiced Monday for the first time and again on Wednesday, could assume a situational role, perhaps as a pass-rusher on third down.        
“So far, so good,” Coples said. “Whatever they tell me, I’ll be prepared for.”        
Receiver Jeremy Kerley, who missed the Jets’ game last Thursday at New England because of a concussion, was cleared by the team’s medical staff and was expected to play Sunday. BEN SHPIGEL

BERLIN — It is an audacious undertaking with wide and deep support in Germany: shut down the nation’s nuclear power plants, wean the country from coal and promote a wholesale shift to renewable energy sources.        


But the plan, backed by Chancellor Angela Merkel and opposition parties alike, is running into problems in execution that are forcing Germans to come face to face with the costs and complexities of sticking to their principles.        
German families are being hit by rapidly increasing electricity rates, to the point where growing numbers of them can no longer afford to pay the bill. Businesses are more and more worried that their energy costs will put them at a disadvantage to competitors in nations with lower energy costs, and some energy-intensive industries have begun to shun the country because they fear steeper costs ahead.        
Newly constructed offshore wind farms churn unconnected to an energy grid still in need of expansion. And despite all the costs, carbon emissions actually rose last year as reserve coal-burning plants were fired up to close gaps in energy supplies.        
A new phrase, “energy poverty,” has entered the lexicon.        
“Often, I don’t go into my living room in order to save electricity,” said Olaf Taeuber, 55, who manages a fleet of vehicles for a social services provider in Berlin. “You feel the pain in your pocketbook.”        
Mr. Taeuber relies on just a single five-watt bulb that gives off what he calls a “cozy” glow to light his kitchen when he comes home at night. If in real need, he switches on a neon tube, which uses all of 25 watts.        
Even so, with his bill growing rapidly, he found himself seeking help last week to fend off a threat from Berlin’s main power company to cut off his electricity. He is one of a growing number of Germans confronting the realities of trying to carry out Ms. Merkel’s most ambitious domestic project and one of the most sweeping energy transformation efforts undertaken by an industrialized country.        
Because the program has the support of German political parties across the spectrum, there has been no highly visible backlash during the current election campaign. But continuing to put the program in place and maintaining public support for it will be among Ms. Merkel’s biggest challenges should she win a third term as chancellor in Sunday’s election.        
Ms. Merkel, of the traditionally conservative and pro-business Christian Democrats, came up with her plan in 2011, in the emotional aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. It envisions shutting down all of Germany’s nuclear plants by 2022 and shifting almost entirely to wind and solar power by 2050.        
The chancellor’s about-face not only seized the energy initiative from her center-left opponents, it also amounted to a gamble that could prove to be her most lasting domestic legacy — or a debacle whose consequences will be felt for generations.        
The cost of the plan is expected to be about $735 billion, according to government estimates, and may eventually surpass even that of the euro zone bailouts that have received far more attention during Ms. Merkel’s tenure. Yet as the transition’s unknowns have grown, so have costs for the state, major companies and consumers.        
Mr. Taeuber showed up last Friday, one of three “walk-ins” that day at one of two agencies in Berlin offering aid to people struggling to pay their energy bills. He arrived just as employees from the power company Vattenfall were on the way to his apartment.        
Sven Gärtner, an agency employee, called Vattenfall with the promise of a payment plan, sparing Mr. Taeuber from being disconnected. “The boys were already in the basement, but they agreed to pull them back,” Mr. Gärtner said triumphantly.        
Since January, Mr. Gärtner said, his group has intervened in more than 350 cases to prevent Vattenfall from leaving one family or another in the dark. In the first six months of this year, about 1,800 sought help, 200 more than in all of 2012.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — For this rendition of Stand in the Schoolhouse Door, there were no National Guard troops or presidential edicts.        


But on Wednesday, several hundred University of Alabama students and faculty members invoked Gov. George Wallace’s 1963 attempt to block the enrollment of black students here as they demanded an end to segregation in the university’s fraternities and sororities. Together, the mostly white group marched within sight of the President’s Mansion, one of the only structures on the campus dating to before the Civil War.        
Tracey Gholston, a black woman who is pursuing a doctorate in American literature at Alabama, said Mr. Wallace’s legacy continued to permeate the university, which has nearly 35,000 students, about 12 percent of them black, and 45 percent from out of state.        
“It shows a thread. It’s not just something that was resolved 50 years ago,” said Ms. Gholston, who has a master’s degree from the university. “You can’t say, ‘We’re integrated. We’re fine.’ We’re not fine.”        
The demonstration came one week after the campus newspaper, The Crimson White, published the account of a member of the university’s Alpha Gamma Delta chapter.        
The student, Melanie Gotz, said the sorority had bowed to alumnae influence and considered race when it evaluated potential new members earlier this year. Other sorority members shared similar stories.        
Racial biases in Alabama’s Greek system, which has a membership of nearly one-quarter of the university’s undergraduate enrollment, have been an open secret for decades.        
It is not an issue unique to Alabama, and it is complicated by an era in which blacks and whites on many campuses often gravitate to fraternities and sororities that are segregated in practice, although many national Greek organizations say they have banned discrimination.        
Still, many feel systemic discrimination has been tolerated at Alabama, and Ms. Gotz’s public revelations led to widespread demands for reform.        
University officials repeatedly had said the responsibility for membership standards rested with the sororities and fraternities, which are private groups. But on Sunday night, the university’s president, Judy L. Bonner, summoned advisers of traditionally white sororities and told them she was ordering an extended admissions process.        
And in a videotaped statement released on Tuesday, she acknowledged that the university’s “Greek system remains segregated,” which students and professors described as a historic admission.        
But the demonstration, which Dr. Bonner greeted when it arrived at the Rose Administration Building, focused on a sweeping demand for the president and her lieutenants: don’t stop restructuring the campus.        
“We are holding the administration accountable and hoping that they hold us accountable, as well, to improve it in a sustained way and not just in a Band-Aid approach,” said Khortlan Patterson, a sophomore. “This was a great success today, but it’s just one step in the process.”        
Ms. Patterson, who has considered joining one of the campus’s predominantly black sororities, has plenty of allies. Protesters at the 7:15 a.m. rally included dozens of blue-shirted members of the Mallet Assembly, a residential program founded in 1961 with a history of urging social change at Alabama. (The only black president of Alabama’s student government, elected in 1976, was a member of the organization.)        
Since Dr. Bonner’s order, those sororities have opened hurried efforts to bring black women into their ranks by extending bids to an unknown number of minority students. It remains unclear whether any of those women will accept the offers.        
The university’s fraternity system, founded in 1847, also remains largely segregated, and people here said they would like to see Alabama broaden its diversity initiative to include those organizations, one of which drew attention in 2009 for staging a parade with its members dressed in Confederate uniforms.        
Most Greek organizations have barred their members from speaking to reporters, but Sam Creden, a demonstrator who is also a member of Delta Sigma Phi, said there was some unease about the ferment.        
“A lot of my fraternity brothers are actually worried that this will be supporting sort of forced integration,” said Mr. Creden, a junior from Chicago.        
Those who marched, he said, are hoping for a deeper, systemic change.        
“We don’t want this to be the facade of integration,” Mr. Creden said. “We want people to truly accept people of all backgrounds and races.”        
Caroline Bechtel, a member of Phi Mu, said Greeks were largely relieved by the events of recent days.        
“The conversations have been happening, but there’s been no real action,” said Ms. Bechtel, a junior.        
“Finally, it feels like something might change, and I think that is refreshing. We don’t have to be scared anymore to want a better community.”

PHILADELPHIA — IN August 2005 my son Alec, then 39 years old, collapsed into unconsciousness while walking his dog in the suburbs of Philadelphia. By the time he arrived at the hospital, his heart rate had slowed to 30 beats per minute. Fortunately, an experienced physician recognized that Alec was having a cardiac complication of Lyme infection. Installation of a pacemaker and an infusion of antibiotics saved his life.        


Each year there are more than 30,000 cases of Lyme disease reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But last month, the C.D.C. announced that the real number of annual infections was closer to 300,000.        
Alec had one of the most serious consequences of a Lyme infection, but the microbe can also lead to neurological illnesses like meningitis and encephalitis and, more commonly, fatigue, arthritis and rashes. But the symptoms can be hard to spot. Indeed, days before he became gravely ill, Alec consulted a physician because of a rash, but because it did not appear in a bull’s-eye shape, Lyme disease was not suspected. (It is a common misconception that the Lyme disease rash always appears this way.)        
The ticks that carry Lyme disease — which are prevalent in the Northeast United States, the Upper Midwest and Northern California, as well as in Central Europe and Scandinavia — can be hard to spot, too. Both nymph and adult ticks can transmit the bacteria, but the tiny nymphs — which emerge in the springtime — are hard to see with the naked eye until they mature in the fall.        
In other words, it’s easy to be bitten and not realize it. If you are infected, it’s easy for a doctor to miss the symptoms. Shouldn’t there be a vaccine for such a prevalent and dangerous disease?        
In fact, we used to have one, and are perfectly capable of producing another, if the public demand is high and we avoid the mistakes of the past.        
In 1998 SmithKline Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline) developed a vaccine that was about 80 percent effective for at least a year after three doses. But the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which counsels the C.D.C. on vaccine use, was lukewarm about the real benefits and necessity of it. The committee made a weak recommendation to “consider” vaccination for high-risk persons, overlooking the fact that plenty of casual gardeners and hikers were being infected. Instead, the committee emphasized the use of protective clothing and insect repellents, despite little evidence that those measures prevent tick bites and even less evidence that people will constantly use them.        
Nevertheless, the vaccine was put on the market and physicians had to decide what to do with the ambiguous recommendations. Then the manufacturer made a strategic error of its own, deciding to directly advertise the vaccination to the public, despite the fact that by and large people rely on their doctors’ recommendations to decide whether to receive a vaccine. In addition, the manufacturer put the vaccine on the market before it had been tested in children, so it could be prescribed only to adults.        
But the biggest blow to the marketing campaign came from a group of volunteers who had been involved in the vaccine’s prelicensure studies and who reported developing arthritic symptoms after the vaccination. Although the rate of arthritis in the vaccinated volunteers was the same as the rate in the control group, some Lyme disease activists concluded that the vaccine caused, rather than prevented, Lyme disease. In 1999, a class-action suit was brought against the manufacturer. Retrospective studies have shown no connection between the vaccination and arthritis, but at the time, sales of the vaccine dropped precipitously, and in 2002 the manufacturer withdrew it from the market.        
Of course, Lyme disease did not go away. The tick that carries the Lyme bacteria is spreading to new areas. And though early antibiotic treatment can kill the Lyme bacteria, the diagnosis is frequently missed at the beginning of the disease, as in my son’s case. We need to prevent people from getting Lyme disease in the first place.        
The experience of Glaxo has unfortunately frightened other companies away from pursuing this needed vaccine. I am a consultant to most of the major vaccine manufacturers (though I have no financial interest in the development of a Lyme vaccine) and I have long been arguing for a return to this area.        
Despite the manufacturers’ reluctance, scientific studies have continued and experimental vaccines against Lyme infection are available for further development. If manufacturers think there is a market for them, they will work to obtain a license from the Food and Drug Administration, but first they must be convinced that the fiasco of the first vaccine will not be repeated. Physicians and patients should write to the C.D.C. to remind them of high public demand. It is likely that a new vaccine would now be recommended for all those who work or play outdoors in the areas where Lyme-bearing ticks are common — a large part of the population of the United States.        
Until then, Americans can vaccinate their dogs against Lyme disease, but have no such option for themselves.

The dreadful monotony and morbidity of the gun control discussion in this country has left me dispirited.        


Another mass shooting. Another round of shock, sadness and outrage. Another pitched discussion about rights and responsibilities, mental illness and background checks. And then nothing.        
The pundits debate merits. The public demands action. But in the end, N.R.A. intimidation pressures the cowards in Congress to maintain the status quo and scare ordinary citizens into believing that they face extraordinary threats — from the burglars out to steal property to a government out to rob them of their guns and the Second Amendment.        
As President Obama told Telemundo:        
“I do get concerned that this becomes a ritual that we go through every three, four months, where we have these horrific mass shootings, and yet, we’re not willing to take some basic actions that we know could make a difference.”        
But it has become a ritual, and we — or at least too many of our congressmen and congresswomen — are too afraid to act. We are stuck in a cycle of savagery as one shooter after another catches us in his sights.        
One reason we talk past one another on guns is that we’re talking from vastly different worldviews.        
According to a March report by the Pew Research Center, gun owners are more likely to be men than women, older rather than younger, white rather than black or Hispanic, live in the Midwest and South, live in rural or suburban areas, and be married. In many ways, this gun ownership division reflects the ideological split in our politics.        
Another reason is that N.R.A. and gun lobby scare tactics have been depressingly effective. They raise the dander of one-issue voters to dazzling effect, and that leaves politicians groveling at their feet.        
So rational discussion gets lost in the weeds of extreme rhetoric. This is not an all-or-nothing battle. But we must approach the issue and the facts with an open mind.        
And we have to start with one point: the vast majority of gun owners are responsible, law-abiding citizens. They own guns for protection, hunting, sports or even as collectors.        
If most of these people weren’t responsible, there would be far more mass shootings than there are now.        
The problem, rather, is that there are simply too many guns in this country to ever ensure that some portion will not fall into the hands of the criminally inclined or the violently insane.        
Gun proliferation is a chicken that has come home to roost.        
According to the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey, there were an estimated 270 million civilian firearms in this country in 2011. The country with the second highest number of weapons — 46 million — was India, which has nearly four times the population of America. A November 2012 Congressional Research Service report put the estimate even higher, at approximately 310 million firearms “available to citizens.” That’s almost one gun to every man, woman and child in this country.        
That leads to this idea of guns-as-protection, the idea that because criminals already have guns, law-abiding citizens need to have them too, just to even the playing field — or dare I say, killing field.        
According to that March Pew report, protection has replaced hunting as the No. 1 reason that people own guns.        
The notion that the world is more dangerous than it used to be and you can be kept safe only with more guns is a linchpin of the N.R.A. argument and a profit inflater for the gun industry. As the N.R.A.’s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, put it: “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”        
The only problem is that the facts don’t neatly line up with that line of reasoning.        
A June report from the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council entitled “Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence” had some intriguing but not conclusive findings.        
According to the report, there were about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008. However, the estimated range of defensive uses of firearms ranged from 108,000 to more than three million. Furthermore, the report pointed out that studies of the effectiveness of the defensive use of guns “have found consistently lower injury rates among gun using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies.”        
However, the study hastened to add:

TEHRAN — A series of good-will gestures and hints of new diplomatic flexibility from Iran’s ruling establishment was capped on Wednesday by the highest-level statement yet that the country’s new leaders are pushing for a compromise in negotiations over their disputed nuclear program.        


In a near staccato burst of pronouncements, statements and speeches by the new president, Hassan Rouhani; his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif; and even the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the leadership has sent Rosh Hashana greetings to Jews worldwide via Twitter, released political prisoners, exchanged letters with President Obama, praised “flexibility” in negotiations and transferred responsibility for nuclear negotiations from the conservatives in the military to the Foreign Ministry.        
“They’re putting stuff out faster than the naysayers can keep up,” said Gary Sick, an Iran expert with Columbia University. “They dominate the airwaves.”        
Mr. Rouhani, preparing for a trip to New York next week for the annual gathering of the United Nations, kept up the dizzying pace on Wednesday in an interview with NBC News in which he declared that Iran would never “seek weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons” and that he had “full power and complete authority” to make a nuclear deal with the West.        
There is plenty of skepticism in the West over the new tone emanating from Tehran, and Iran veterans have seen previous thaws in the diplomatic climate disappear seemingly overnight. Mr. Obama has spoken of testing Mr. Rouhani’s seriousness.        
But Iran experts, citing the apparent end to Iran’s ideological taboo against direct talks with the United States as well as the apparent concurrence of the supreme leader, say that this new moderation seems different.        
Tehran’s turnaround is all the more startling in view of the eight, often bizarre, years of Mr. Rouhani’s Holocaust-denying predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who relished every opportunity to ruffle the feathers of Western leaders. But Mr. Ahmadinejad’s bellicose nationalism drove Iran into a diplomatic isolation that left it with Venezuela and Syria for allies and saddled it with debilitating economic sanctions over its nuclear program, analysts said.        
Those sanctions have more than halved Iran’s oil sales, from 2.4 million barrels a day in 2011 to less than 1 million now, and inflation has spiked; the currency, the rial, has fallen by half. It was the danger of falling even deeper into this economic abyss, possibly threatening their hold on power, that prompted Iran’s leaders to mend ties not only with the West but with their own people, who desperately want more personal freedoms, analysts say.        
“We are now at a unique moment in the Islamic republic’s history,” said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst close to Mr. Rouhani. “Economic reasons are now justifying political reasons to talk to the U.S.”        
The current moment differs significantly from an earlier reform period under President Mohammad Khatami, when the rules on public behavior and freedom of expression were relaxed. But in contrast to the current situation, Mr. Khatami never had the serious backing of the Iranian political establishment. “Our supreme leader, Mr. Khamenei, has given the green light; that means there will be no groups trying to sabotage potential talks like in the past,” Mr. Ghorbanpour said.        
When he arrives in New York next week, one expert said, Mr. Rouhani will be bringing along a package of proposals on Iran’s nuclear program, which Tehran says is for peaceful purposes but the West believes is a cover for developing weapons.        
“I think he will be able to discuss Iran putting a cap on the number of uranium enrichment centrifuges, the conversion of the stockpile of uranium enriched up to 20 percent into harmless fuel plates or dilute it down to 3, 5 percent,” said Mohammad Ali Shabani, a political analyst based in Tehran who holds moderate views. There could also be talks of Iran accepting more inspections by at some point ratifying an additional protocol to the United Nations’ nuclear nonproliferation treaty, Mr. Shabani said.        
The German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported that Mr. Rouhani might also be ready to close down Fordo, Iran’s highly secure mountain bunker, which is believed to be safe from any Israeli attack. But Mr. Shabani said this would not happen. “This site is Iran’s insurance card in case of a military attack,” he said. “I highly doubt Iran would close that down.”        
Mr. Rouhani has also indicated that he prefers to negotiate over the nuclear case with the West on the highest political levels possible, and there was even talk of a meeting next week with Mr. Obama, an event that would have been all but inconceivable only weeks ago.        
Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday that there were no plans for Mr. Obama to meet with Mr. Rouhani when both leaders are at the United Nations early next week. But he said the president was eager to see whether the issue of Iran’s nuclear program could be resolved.        
“As we have long said, the window of opportunity for resolving this diplomatically is open, but it will not remain open indefinitely,” Mr. Carney said.

SAN FRANCISCO — Beaten again, James Spithill, the hard-driving skipper for Oracle Team USA, stood on his team’s catamaran Wednesday — with rough water and the Bay Bridge for a backdrop — and answered questions through a headset.        


“It’s not over; it’s a long way from over,” Spithill said.        
That seemed much closer to bravado than to reality, with Emirates Team New Zealand needing only one more victory to dispossess Oracle of the America’s Cup and with Race 12 just about to begin.        
But there are other forces at work in San Francisco Bay beyond crew work and technology worthy of nearby Silicon Valley. There are the wind limits put in place in the wake of the sailor Andrew Simpson’s accidental death in May. Those wind limits canceled both scheduled races Tuesday, then forced the second race to be postponed Wednesday with the big yachts already jousting for position and heading for the starting line.        
No, the America’s Cup is still not over, even though it now seems only a matter of when, not if, the Kiwis will finish off Spithill and his multinational crew and their billionaire owner, Larry Ellison.        
Wednesday’s postponement came after Team New Zealand had won the day’s first race by 15 seconds to take an 8-1 lead in the Cup. The hundreds of New Zealanders gathered on shore at America’s Cup Park and perhaps as many as a million more watching back home on morning television were poised for a celebration that has been a decade in the making for the nation of 4.4 million.        
Now the Kiwis must wait until at least Thursday, when two more races are scheduled, either of which could be the final race.        
“We can’t sit back and try to play it safe,” said Ray Davies, Team New Zealand’s tactician. “We’ve got to sail every race as best we can and push the boat really, really hard. You really notice it. As soon as you back off a little bit on these boats and try to go a bit conservative, your leads can get chopped down really quick.”        
Davies and the Kiwis balanced risk and reward quite nicely in Wednesday’s first race, taking advantage of their favored port entry in the strong ebb tide that has complicated this week’s racing and also made the wind limits even lower.        
Team New Zealand had the lead at the starting line, and then, with the two boats overlapped, used its right of way to force Oracle to drop speed. It then sailed away with a clear lead that was three seconds at the first mark.        
But these AC72s, capable of hydro-foiling and hitting speeds well over 40 knots, are remarkably close in performance at this stage, and Oracle remained in close touch on the downwind leg. Team New Zealand’s lead was only six seconds at the second rounding mark, and Oracle even took the lead briefly on the upwind leg that followed.        
But the Kiwis controlled the top of that leg beautifully. A mediocre tack from Oracle contributed to significant separation and a 17-second lead at the third mark. The gap grew bigger until Oracle, sailing alone and close to the boundaries of the course, began to make serious gains downwind.        
But Davies and his team were thinking big picture, trying to avoid extra jibes that could have slowed their own progress. Spithill and the two Olympic gold medalists in his afterguard — Tom Slingsby and Ben Ainslie — could never conjure a way to get back in front, as the Kiwis, responding with just a hint of desperation, held them off and rounded with an 18-second lead before closing out their latest hard-fought victory.        
“To have, in the first generation of the class, two boats that are this close in performance over a wide variety of conditions is quite unbelievable,” said Dean Barker, Team New Zealand’s understated skipper. “I think both teams have reacted very well to what they’ve observed of the other team, and I think the boats have just come together in terms of performance.”        
But though the races have become tight and compelling, the gap in the standings keeps increasing. Team New Zealand has won eight races to Oracle’s three, but because of a two-race penalty imposed on Oracle for cheating before the Cup match began, the official score is 8-1.        
“Look, we’ve got a hell of a battle on our hands here, but stranger things have happened in sport,” Spithill said. “I’ve witnessed some pretty big comebacks.”        
There is no precedent for a comeback of this magnitude in the America’s Cup, which dates to 1851. And the prospect of losing the Cup hardly seems to have San Franciscans up in arms, clamoring for more speed from Oracle Team USA, a team that has only one American in its starting crew of 11.        
“I’d love to see the Kiwis, the little underdogs, that tiny little country that has more sheep than people, take down Larry Ellison,” said Mike Altman, a 35-year-old American from San Francisco who was following the racing from America’s Cup Park on Wednesday.        
Altman added: “Larry’s got a big ego, and you know I feel like he’s not necessarily the most well-liked business leader around the area. He hasn’t made a lot of friends. He’s known as pretty brash. A lot of people see this as his own personal party, his own little ego trip, and it’s not something that I think a lot of people were clamoring for, to have an America’s Cup here.”        
Now it is likely to soon be gone, possibly never to return. In 162 years of the Cup, only eight sites have staged the races. One of them was Auckland, New Zealand, in 2000 and 2003.        
No matter what Spithill says into his headset, a return visit looks imminent.

Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has been trying to undermine the state’s affordable housing laws ever since he stepped into office. As a result, wary fair-housing advocates are watching his every move.        


In a new lawsuit filed last week, one organization, the Fair Share Housing Center, charged the Christie administration with improperly withholding data that would allow the group to determine whether low-income and minority New Jersey residents were getting a fair share of the $1.8 billion in federal aid committed to the state under the Hurricane Sandy recovery plan. The suit argues that this information should be made public before the federal government releases the next round of recovery money.        
The housing center says that it is contacted “on an almost daily basis” by low-income families who have been denied assistance for their damaged or destroyed homes and cannot get clear answers from the state on why they have been turned down. It contends the Christie administration has failed to provide data that it is required to surrender under the state’s open records laws.        
Among other things, it has sought clarification of eligibility rules as well as demographic information — including race, ethnicity, age, disability and income — of people who have applied for help. According to documents in the suit, the state requested a 30-day extension beyond the response period specified in New Jersey law, and it still did not furnish all the information at the end of that period.        
This is not the first time the Christie administration has fought with housing advocates over Sandy recovery aid. Earlier this year, for example, they clashed over the state’s original recovery plan, which contained too little money for building and repairing rental properties, where lower-income people typically live. The state increased the financing after housing advocates complained to the federal government. If the administration has nothing to hide about who is getting the Sandy aid, then it should release the pertinent data immediately.

On Jan. 12, three sheriff’s deputies moonlighting as mall security guards in Frederick County, Md., assaulted and killed a 26-year-old man, Robert Ethan Saylor, who had refused to leave his seat in a movie theater. Mr. Saylor suffocated on the floor, on his stomach, hands cuffed behind him. His death was ruled a homicide.        


The deputies’ handling of an unarmed, vulnerable young man with an intellectual disability (Mr. Saylor had Down syndrome) was plainly lethal and incompetent. A county grand jury declined to bring criminal charges, but the Justice Department is investigating whether Mr. Saylor’s civil rights were violated.        
As Mr. Saylor’s family and disability-rights advocates await answers, Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland is doing something useful. On Monday, he announced the creation of a commission to examine how law-enforcement officers, paramedics and others deal with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities.        
The Saylor case has exposed gaping deficiencies in law-enforcement training, which often fails to distinguish between mental illness and mental disability. Mr. Saylor might have been stubborn and argumentative, but he was not mentally ill or a criminal. Those who know him insist that the encounter could have been defused with patience and sensitivity. Three deputies who lacked understanding of mental disabilities might have benefited from practical instruction, which the Frederick County sheriff acknowledged no one in his department had ever received.        
The chairman of the governor’s commission is Timothy Shriver, chairman and chief executive of the Special Olympics, the international movement dedicated to raising that understanding. If the Maryland commission comes up with policies and practices that change the way agencies see and treat those with disabilities and prevent future tragedies, it will have delivered a measure of recompense for Mr. Saylor’s senseless death. It is charged with producing a preliminary report by Jan. 9, which would have been Mr. Saylor’s 27th birthday.

The Federal Reserve did the right thing when it decided on Wednesday not to begin reducing the monthly, multibillion-dollar bond purchases that are a pillar of its efforts to spur the economy. To do otherwise would have violated the Fed’s own criteria for gradually withdrawing the support measures.        


The Fed has said that any easing would be premised on “substantial improvement” in the labor market. But job growth has been slowing of late, and what little there has been has tended to be in low-paying jobs. The Fed has also been looking for a sizable increase in economic growth, but that has not materialized and is unlikely to, given various headwinds, including the prospect of another round of damaging budget fights in Washington.        
The decision to stay the course is also important because it indicates that the Fed is giving due consideration to both sides of its dual mandate to foster both price stability and full employment. The bond-buying program, which is intended to bolster the economy by keeping long-term borrowing rates low, is not without peril. But its biggest danger — rising inflation — is nowhere in evidence. That means that the potential stimulative benefits of the bond purchases still outweigh the potential downsides.        
That does not mean that the program is an ideal or even particularly effective way to combat persistent economic weakness. The economy’s problems — a weak labor market, stagnant wages, insufficient consumer demand, widening income inequality, intractable poverty — are not primarily the Fed’s to solve. Rather, they require direct government policies to create jobs, raise wages, spur demand, increase taxes on the wealthy and expand the safety net.        
These, however, are Congress’s responsibilities, thwarted largely by Republicans, who have opposed policies that would help the economy (and thus reflect well on President Obama) while promoting automatic budget cuts and other policies that can only slow the recovery. Without naming names, the Fed said as much in its statement when it singled out “the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment” as a particular drag on the economy.        
The Fed should do whatever it can. But only Congress can provide what most needs to be done.

Despite its name, the World Bar is about the last place you would expect to find United Nations staff members after work.        


The two-story lounge is too fancy for civil servants: its marble bar glows from within; the small tables perch on Giacometti-style bases; sheer fabric drapes the floor-to-ceiling windows. Tucked into the Trump World Tower, the place evokes an air of internationalism too aloof and detached from the gritty goings-on at the compound just across the street.        
But its location on First Avenue couldn’t be more convenient for those seeking a reprieve from the numbing whirl of geopolitics. And on Wednesday nights, the World Bar offers anyone with a blue United Nations pass — generally worn around the neck on a long metal chain — discounts on wine, beer and cocktails.        
The World Bar gave off a healthy pulse on a late-summer evening, the sky outside streaked with purple and pink along the East River. Inside, a predominantly male crowd of starry-eyed, overdressed expats mixed with seasoned do-gooders whose conversations carried over from their office cubicles. The place hummed with United Nations-related jargon: “S.R.S.G.,” “perpetrators,” “framework” and “child protection people.”        
The talk might dwell on instances of horrid human behavior, but a lighthearted mood prevails at the World Bar, which the owner, Mark Grossich, calls an “off-site U.N. hangout.” Everyone needs a place to unwind.        
The strapping young bartender this night, Abraham Marin, hailed from Venezuela, a member of the Non-Aligned Movement — that is, outside the Western clique. He set an easygoing tone even as a television with CNN on beamed photographs of children’s swathed bodies, killed by sarin gas in Syria.        
Mr. Marin noted that his home country used to produce beer but now, he said, it was made in Colombia and sold back to Venezuelans. He raised his fist, saying in a wry tone, “Thank you, Chávez.”        
He attended to a man dressed in a suit and tie, attached to an iPhone, who looked as if he wanted to be a spy but might in fact do something more mundane. Cheese cubes, popcorn and chicken skewers arrived as part of the happy hour. Along the perimeter, by the windows and their street views, comfortable seating attracted those who wanted to speak intimately, or at least with the illusion they would not be overheard. A language other than English helps for that purpose: Arabic here, French there — with plenty of representatives from Europe, West Africa and MENA, as policy wonks call the Middle East North Africa region.        
Two men, approaching middle age, conversed in Dutch. With sharp suits and open dress shirts, they were part of the United Nations cabal but not necessarily of it: retired military officers advising the D.P.K.O., as the peacekeeping agency is known. They, too, savored talking shop, leaning forward as they ran through the laundry list: jihadists in Mali, the “robust” force in Congo, the latest “weak state.”        
The annual General Assembly debate begins on Tuesday, flooding Midtown with at least 130 heads of state, 60 foreign ministers and their retinues. The World Bar and its competitor inside the United Nations, the North Delegates’ Lounge, will be swelling with crowds of bureaucrats, diplomats and journalists hungry for facts and gossip. Just as quickly, most of them will depart, leaving Turtle Bay to the lifers.        
Shadrack Venson, a United Nations librarian from Botswana, doesn’t usually go out for drinks after work. But, he said recently, he was thinking of moving to another job in the institution — a “field mission,” as he put it — and so he was thinking of dropping by the World Bar soon.        
“I need to network,” he said.

Until now, the only House Republicans pushing for a government shutdown and debt crisis were a few dozen on the radical right, the ones Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, referred to as “the anarchists.” On Wednesday, however, the full Republican caucus, leadership and all, joined the anarchy movement, announcing plans to demand the defunding of health care reform as the price for keeping the government open past Sept. 30.        


The decision means that a government shutdown next month is now much more likely. In the past, shutdown threats were averted because Republican leaders were willing to negotiate on spending issues, though the spending cuts that resulted were often harmful to important programs. But the health law is not negotiable for President Obama and the Democrats. By choosing this as their live-or-die issue, Republicans are driving straight toward the brink and removing the brake pedal.        
What is worse, the House leadership also announced plans to make a series of demands of the White House in exchange for raising the debt ceiling in mid-October, threatening a government default if they don’t get their way. The demands, announced by the majority leader, Eric Cantor, are a goodie-bag of Republican priorities: approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline, delaying health reform by a year, and changing the tax code in ways that will undoubtedly benefit corporations and the wealthy.        
Mr. Obama has said that he will not negotiate on raising the debt ceiling. “What I will not do is to create a habit, a pattern, whereby the full faith and credit of the United States ends up being a bargaining chip to set policy,” he said on Wednesday morning. If Republicans don’t back down, the double blow of a government shutdown, followed by a default, would be ruinous to the economy.        
As a strategy, the House plan makes little sense. After the House takes its vote this week to approve a temporary resolution that pays for the government to keep running through mid-December — but defunds the health law — the measure will go to the Senate. Assuming 60 votes can be found to beat back the inevitable filibuster from Republicans like Mike Lee or Ted Cruz, the Senate will almost certainly approve the resolution minus the defunding language, sending the bill right back to the House. Nothing will have changed, except that there will be only a day or two left before the government’s financing runs out.        
As a political statement, this plan illuminates the chaotic state of the Republican Party. Speaker John Boehner, who preferred to have symbolic rather than real votes against the health law, lost control of his chamber to hard-liners obsessed with repealing it. Many on the right, who came to Washington with the radical agenda of ending as many government programs as they could, practically welcome the prospect of a shutdown or even a default. (Their tactics will never turn back health reform, but fighting that battle means Democrats are unlikely to stop the destructive sequester cuts for another year.)        
Mr. Boehner is playing the dangerous game of trying to placate the extremists for a few days. But, in the end, the burden will be squarely on his shoulders. If he allows the entire House, including Democrats, to vote on straightforward measures to pay for the government and raise the debt limit, the double crisis will instantly end. If he does not, he will give free rein to his party’s worst impulses.

The war against Obamacare: All the rationality of a Justin Bieber fan riot, and all the restraint of “Saw VI.”        


On Wednesday, leaders of the House of Representatives announced their plans for a 42nd and 43rd vote to thwart the new health care reform law. If they don’t get their way, they’re threatening to defund the government and crack the debt ceiling.        
“The law is a train wreck,” said Speaker John Boehner. The majority leader, Eric Cantor, said someone had to protect middle-class families from “its horrific effects.”        
The arrival of Obamacare is worse than an invasion of giant zombies swinging nuclear-tipped crocodiles! Yet it lives! If only we lived in a country where citizens had the power to turn things around by voting lawmakers out of office. Like Uruguay or Latvia.        
Seriously, people, why do you think the Republicans have gone so completely lunatic when it comes to this issue? Why do they behave as if, once the health law begins to roll out, it will be cemented in place like an amendment to the Constitution?        
True, it would be a pain to repeal the whole thing if it doesn’t work out. But not a pain sufficient to wreak havoc on the global economy like, say, refusing to raise the debt ceiling. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has been leading the push to shut down the government unless Congress repeals Obamacare. But have you ever heard him vow that if Congress doesn’t repeal Obamacare there will be ... elections and then a new Congress that will repeal Obamacare?        
Actually, Ted Cruz has an answer for this. Once the law goes into effect, he told the Web site The Daily Caller, the public will be overwhelmed by its sugary sweetness — “hooked on the subsidies.” It’s the duty of Congress to take it back before people can taste it, just the way New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg tried to whisk away high-calorie Big Gulps.        
So, the message is clear. The new health care law is going to be terrible, wreaking havoc on American families, ruining their lives. And they are going to love it so much they will never have the self-control necessary to give it up.        
So the war goes on. No issue is too big to ignore in the name of Obamacare repeal. None is too small. None is too unrelated. In the Senate, the latest victim was a popular, useful bill on energy efficiency, whose happy march toward passage came screeching to a halt when a handful of Republicans tried to make it a vehicle for votes on you-know-what.        
“This will be the most, the worst ...” sputtered Harry Reid, grasping for adjectives before settling on “the least productive Senate in the history of the country.”        
“Least productive” was fairer than “worst.” After all, there was that session when somebody beat Senator Charles Sumner half to death with a walking stick.        
Anyway, things are ridiculously awful.        
The energy efficiency bill is the legislative version of a fluffy puppy. It was co-sponsored by Democrat Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Republican Rob Portman of Ohio. It involves helping manufacturers save money on energy use, and creating new model building codes, making plans and cooperating and studying. Portman and Shaheen have been working on it for three years.        
“Energy efficiency is something everyone can agree to,” said Shaheen in a phone interview.        
Well, possibly not everybody. It’s hard to predict how the bill would fare in the House, where some people still haven’t gotten over the Bush administration’s decision to phase out incandescent light bulbs. But there were at least some signs of hope.        
And things were going great in the Senate. The bill was approved 19 to 3 in committee. When it came up for debate on the floor, nobody even attempted to offer a parliamentary motion to hold up all progress indefinitely and then require 60 votes to move forward.        
“Then,” Shaheen said sadly, “Senator Vitter objected.” David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, demanded a vote on his amendment to eliminate any health care subsidies for Congress. He was followed by the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, waiving a proposal to postpone an entire piece of the law. Reid refused to allow indefinite voting on Obamacare during the energy efficiency bill debate. The fluffy puppy was caged in the basement.        
You do not want to know all the details of Vitter’s motion. The original health care legislation stripped members of Congress and their staff of their traditional insurance coverage. Nobody would care if the members voted to cover themselves through policies available only on Nigerian Internet sites. But the staff is another matter. If the amendment passes, people like Congressional clerical workers would be virtually the only Americans offered every possible disadvantage and none of the advantages of health care reform.        
“It’s to get them to recognize the pain that America’s about to feel,” said Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming.        
Followed, of course, by delicious, addictive joy.

BEIRUT, Lebanon — An extremist group linked to Al Qaeda routed Syrian rebel fighters and seized control of a gateway town near Syria’s northern border with Turkey on Wednesday, posting snipers on rooftops, erecting checkpoints and imposing a curfew on the local population.        


The takeover of the town, Azaz, by fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, reflected the rising strength of extremist fighters in northern and eastern Syria and their rapidly deteriorating relations with more mainline rebels.        
By early Thursday, Islamist rebel leaders had intervened to stop the fighting, although most of the town appeared firmly in the hands of the extremists, opposition activists said. The extremists had not seized the nearby Bab al-Salameh border crossing with Turkey. Azaz sits just south of the border crossing on the road to Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, and has served as an important artery for the rebellion in northern Syria, allowing arms, fighters and supplies to move in and refugees fleeing the violence to leave the country.        
Its seizure is likely to alarm Syria’s neighbors. Turkey, which has vocally supported the fight against forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and allowed fighters and arms to flow freely across its southern border, now faces a bold Qaeda affiliate.        
Lebanon has sought information for more than a year about nine Lebanese Shiites held captive by rebels in Azaz. The town’s seizure by a group that considers Shiites heretics who deserve execution is sure to increase worries about their fate.        
The takeover also signals a new low in relations between the rebels fighting a civil war against Mr. Assad’s forces and international jihadists who have flocked to rebel-controlled areas to lay the groundwork for an Islamic state.        
For much of the 30-month-old conflict, the rebels welcomed jihadist fighters for the know-how and battlefield prowess they brought to the anti-Assad struggle. In recent months, however, jihadist groups have isolated local populations by imposing strict Islamic codes, carrying out public executions and clashing with rebel groups.        
In the eastern city of Deir al-Zour on Wednesday, extremist fighters took dozens of rebels captive after a gunfight near a rebel base, activists said.        
Reached by telephone, a rebel commander who gave only his first name, Khattab, said that Wednesday’s violence in Azaz began when ISIS fighters stormed the town and tried to detain German doctors who were visiting a hospital.        
As local doctors tried to keep out the fighters, rebel brigades arrived and clashes erupted, Khattab said. At least three rebel fighters were killed, he said, as well as an opposition media activist, who was shot dead in the street by a sniper.        
“He was left bleeding, and the ISIS fighters did not allow anyone to take his body,” he said.        
Dr. Moayyad Qieto, also reached by phone, said the German doctors worked for a group that financed the Azaz hospital. They were evacuated, unharmed, to the nearby border with Turkey.        
“The situation is so tense, like a volcano that might erupt at any time,” Dr. Qieto said.

If Mets pitcher Matt Harvey has Tommy John surgery on his right elbow, it will be paid for, partly, with workers’ compensation insurance. A partly torn ulnar collateral ligament like Harvey’s is considered a workplace injury, just as if he were a truck driver hurt on a loading dock.        


The basic agreement between major league owners and players requires that teams pay the cost of injuries.        
“The employer gets to recover, as an offset, any workers’ compensation recovery that is available,” said Rob Manfred, an executive vice president of Major League Baseball. “And the club is on the hook for what workers’ compensation doesn’t pay.”        
At some point after an operation or procedure, a player signs a form that allows his team to pursue the insurance claim. So if workers’ compensation did not pay the full cost of Derek Jeter’s surgery for a fractured left ankle last year, the Yankees made up the difference — essentially the cost of doing business.        
“The player never sees a bill,” Manfred said.        
Another factor is that the cost of Tommy John surgery is not uniform. Dr. James Andrews, the renowned orthopedic surgeon, might charge more than the Hospital for Special Surgery, where the Mets’ medical director, David Altchek, is an orthopedic surgeon. (Andrews prescribed a six- to eight-week rehabilitation program for Harvey earlier this week that would precede any decision to operate.)        
Altchek performed Tommy John surgery on one of Harvey’s teammates, Jeremy Hefner.        
Reimbursement for a surgeon’s services and hospital costs varies widely based on state fee schedules, said John Burton, a workers’ compensation expert and professor emeritus at the School of Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers.        
“A lot of states are getting into fee schedules that would limit the amount of reimbursement that a practitioner or hospital would receive,” he said. “Some states, like New Jersey, don’t have a fee schedule, but it’s one of the few.”        
One baseball team executive, who was not authorized to speak publicly, cited recent cases of insurance company reimbursement for the costs of Tommy John surgery, including the fees for the surgeon, the anesthesia and the operating room time.        
In one instance, the insurer paid $13,087 on a $25,075 claim. In another example, the insurer paid $10,255 on a $38,076 claim.        
Frederick M. Azar, an orthopedic surgeon at Campbell Clinic in Memphis, said a small local survey by his staff discovered a surgeon’s fee for Tommy John surgery to be nearly $2,900, while hospital or surgical center costs ranged from $13,000 to $16,000. Still more money would have to be spent on rehabilitation, which is easier for a professional or college athlete.        
“A lot of athletes involved in rehab have team trainers, which is a built-in cost,” said Azar, the team physician for the Memphis Grizzlies.        
Baseball has a single workers’ compensation policy through a major insurer that is for all the employees of its teams, not just the players. Coverage with private plans like baseball’s is different from the more commonplace workers’ compensation insurance, which is available through states but is financed by employers.        
For baseball, whose teams once handled their own insurance in this area, the centralized, industrywide policy that it has had for about a decade has saved teams tens of millions of dollars in premiums.        
Manfred said teams paid the premiums based on the size of their payrolls, their injury experience and the “generosity of the benefits of the state in which you operate.”

Re “Suspect’s Past Fell Just Short of Raising Alarm” (front page, Sept. 18):        
After every mass shooting there follows immediately the question, What was his motive? Was he a disgruntled employee, did he have a personal grudge against someone, was it political, was he depressed, was he mentally ill?        
In my view this endless discussion of motive is pointless. He did it because he could! Even with the documented encounters he had with law enforcement and his own attempts to seek help for his mental problems, he was able to easily obtain a gun and carry out the 20th mass shooting during Barack Obama’s presidency.        
Mr. Obama was criticized for speaking to the debt ceiling issue at the same time that he made remarks about the shooting. He was said to be insensitive. What about us as a nation? It doesn’t seem to bother us enough to do something about it. We have our moment of silence and go on.

As a psychiatrist recently retired after 45 years at Bellevue Hospital, I was intrigued by your article’s description of the police visit to Aaron Alexis, the gunman, after he complained of a “microwave machine” causing vibrations in his walls that kept him awake, and of hearing voices. No details are given about the questions asked by the police or about their ultimate decision as to how to pursue the matter.        
Having been asked to determine the potential dangerousness of many such individuals during my career, I developed a simple and usually effective approach. Speaking calmly, tactfully and empathically, I asked the person if he (or she) was in any danger. If the answer was yes, I would try to determine the exact nature of the danger, and then would find out how the person hoped to protect himself. Then I would ask if he possessed any weapons, and how they might be used.        
I found that, in most cases, the answers would be forthcoming, truthful and ingenuous, and would rapidly inform me if the person presented a danger.

Your recent editorial calling for federal clarification on marijuana enforcement laws (“The Marijuana Muddle,” Sept. 13) is well taken but not the entire solution. Though federal authorities have an important role in how marijuana sales are regulated and enforced, state and local officials are at least as important.        
As our state enacts our new recreational marijuana system after voter approval of Initiative 502 last November, we must also clarify our state’s regulation of medical cannabis.        
As one of 20 medical cannabis states, Washington is wrestling with how to ensure that legitimate, authorized patients can safely and reliably access medicine, while protecting the public and eliminating the black market in our new recreational marijuana system.        
We are addressing how to keep recreational users from trying to avoid paying taxes in licensed stores by obtaining marijuana from currently unregulated medical cannabis “dispensaries” and making sure we comply with all eight provisions of the Justice Department’s recently released guidelines, including restricting minors from obtaining the product.

Re “New Metric for Colleges: Graduates’ Salaries,” by James B. Stewart (Common Sense column, Sept. 14):        
At a time when many of us are pursuing thoughtful ways to measure the “value” of the education we provide, I believe that the PayScale ranking is fundamentally flawed.        
For example, PayScale does not include graduates who hold advanced degrees, and given that roughly 80 percent of Wellesley alumnae pursue graduate and professional degrees, we are, to say the least, not well represented.        
This means that the PayScale ranking does not include high-paying careers like medicine or law, fields in which Wellesley alumnae are well represented.        
Unless and until PayScale refines its analysis to reflect meaningful data, its ranking system is an unhelpful distraction. I disagree with the practice of measuring success solely by money earned. If one insists on doing so, however, then one should use a measure that doesn’t defy common sense.

True to form, that’s what I did: follow a 40-year academic career. It’s no surprise that Obie grads stand at 218th place on PayScale’s ranking: it’s an Oberlin tradition.

Particularly memorable was a professor of history who told us, “Our graduates may not always do well, but they always do good.”

Re “A Whistle-Blower’s Letter Led to a Charity’s Firing of Its Chief Executive” (news article, Sept. 16):        
The troubling allegations surrounding the recently departed head of the nonprofit Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty are sad and unfortunate. But what would be more unfortunate is if the entire nonprofit sector — the many thousands of mission-driven organizations serving New York City — were tainted as well.        
Legitimate and honest service organizations must not be penalized because of the negative publicity surrounding a single individual. New York City’s vulnerable people depend upon a robust and vital social service infrastructure of agencies in our city.        
And these agencies in turn depend upon the generosity and trust of donors whose belief in the integrity of our organizations must not be shaken by this regrettable incident.

Re “Push for Yellen to Lead at Fed Gathers Steam” (front page, Sept. 17):        
Lawrence H. Summers’s shortcomings notwithstanding, Janet L. Yellen seems eminently qualified to be Fed chairwoman, and she has a working knowledge of the institution. Positioning her possible selection as President Obama’s caving to the left does a great disservice to her.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 20, 2013Because of an editing error, a letter on Thursday about the selection of a new chairman of the Federal Reserve misspelled the surname of a candidate who withdrew from consideration.

Re “Selling Art and Selling Out” (Critic’s Notebook, Sept. 11):        
Roberta Smith’s compelling article about the perils confronting the Detroit Institute of Arts mentions that the institute “exists for the benefit of the people of Detroit, the state and the region.” Its importance, in truth, extends much farther than that. It is a valuable asset of the United States, and the entire country will suffer greatly if the institute’s art is sold off to private investors in other lands.        
The Metropolitan Museum is an asset of the United States, not just New York City. Mount Rushmore’s importance extends beyond the borders of South Dakota. The Washington Monument belongs to more people than the citizens of the nation’s capital. Independence Hall is important to all Americans, not just those in Philadelphia.        
In the same way, the Detroit Institute of Arts and the treasures it holds should be recognized as a national monument that this country can ill afford to lose.

ZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan — Those Americans who count themselves as “war-weary” should meet Fawzia, a middle-aged woman who made perhaps the most difficult decision any parent can.        


Fawzia was among the refugees straggling across the Syria-Jordan border here. She had just arrived on a dangerous weeklong journey from Ghouta, Syria, a Damascus suburb where nerve gas killed hundreds on Aug 21. But for Fawzia, chemical weapons are secondary. The real weapons of mass destruction in Syria are the AK-47s, rockets, missiles and bombs. An agreement brokered by the world’s powers that is limited to chemical weapons — while useful — seems a bit irrelevant to the atrocities that define the lives of most Syrians.        
No one in Fawzia’s family was hurt in the chemical weapons attack, but then there was a ferocious conventional shelling of her neighborhood. Her family members scattered in terror, and Mustafa, her 8-year-old son, disappeared. No one knows what happened to him.        
Fawzia decided to flee with two children to Jordan, in hopes of saving them, possibly sacrificing Mustafa. She is racked by guilt.        
The United Nations refugee agency, which runs this Zaatari camp, is accustomed to tragedy. An aid worker gently told her how to register Mustafa’s name in case he turns up somewhere.        
Talking to Syrians like Fawzia, it seems bizarre and narcissistic that in Washington there is talk of whether the Syrian crisis has been “resolved.” Maybe the politicians’ crisis there has been eased, but the humanitarian catastrophe here just gets worse.        
Indeed, in the last couple of weeks, President Bashar al-Assad seems to have stepped up the pace of bombing, shelling and other conventional attacks on civilian areas.        
Fawzia says she would like to see American missile strikes on her country, in hopes that an assault would degrade the Syrian army’s capacity for mass murder and shorten the war. That seems by far the most common view among refugees here, although it’s not universal. Some worry about civilian casualties or think a strike would be too little, too late.        
Whatever one thinks of a military strike to destroy some of Assad’s murderous air force — I’m in favor but have very little company in America — we should find common ground in insisting that international negotiations address not only chemical stockpiles but also humanitarian access in Syria.        
That would mean demanding that the Syrian government and rebels alike allow aid workers and food and medical assistance across their lines. It’s not impossible that both sides would agree under pressure, and that might ease some of the worst suffering within Syria.        
Valerie Amos, the United Nations humanitarian chief, tells me that nearly seven million Syrians will need aid to survive. Humanitarian access could save some of those lives, and also reduce the hemorrhage of refugees.        
The United Nations estimates that every 17 seconds another Syrian flees the country, placing almost unbearable strains on Lebanon and Jordan, in particular. Jordan has been remarkably welcoming to Syrian refugees, but public resentment has apparently led the government to tighten the arrival spigot recently, and many tens of thousands of displaced Syrians are now reportedly stuck on the Syrian side of the border.        
One-third of Syrians are now displaced. On an American scale, that would be equivalent to 100 million Americans having fled their homes.        
This refugee camp, Zaatari, is already one of the biggest cities in Jordan, and the refugees are tough to manage. A few months ago, they began dismantling a trailer that functioned as a police station. Within hours, there was nothing left; they had stolen an entire police station.        
Many refugees told me that everyone in their neighborhoods would relocate to Jordan if it weren’t so dangerous to travel.        
Fareeda al-Hassan, a woman from the city of Hama, had just crossed from Syria with a gaggle of children when I met her. She explained that government bombing had destroyed her home and she had seen pro-government militias behead children, so she paid a guide to smuggle them on a 10-day journey that bypassed government checkpoints. If soldiers think travelers are headed for Jordan, they sometimes execute them as presumptive traitors.        
During the family’s journey, a machine-gun post opened fire on their convoy. The two vehicles in front of theirs, a bus and a private car, burst into flames and everyone in them was killed, Hassan said.        
Guides ferrying Syrians to Jordan sometimes give small children sleeping pills so that they won’t cry from hunger and draw an attack from Syrian troops.        
We may not be able to solve Syria’s problems. I’m not even certain that we can mitigate them. But we can try, and a starting point would be a big push for humanitarian access.        
Maybe that would even allow aid workers to find Mustafa and reunite him with his guilt-ridden mother.

WASHINGTON — The White House warned consumers on Wednesday to beware of possible fraud by con artists taking advantage of the new insurance marketplaces being set up under President Obama’s health care law.        


The warning came amid reports of fraud, high-pressure sales tactics and efforts to obtain personal information from consumers in advance of the opening of the online markets known as insurance exchanges.        
White House officials said that consumers should be suspicious if anyone asked them for money to enroll in a health plan offered through an insurance exchange. Legitimate insurance counselors and “enrollment assisters” will not ask for money, they said.        
In addition, White House officials said that Medicare beneficiaries did not need to sign up through an insurance exchange. Advocates for older Americans said that many were confused and wrongly believed that they needed to apply for coverage through the exchanges, scheduled to open Oct. 1.        
The White House warning, part of a coordinated effort by federal agencies to protect consumers, came several hours after a House committee issued a report describing “risks of fraud and misinformation” in efforts to enroll millions of low- and moderate-income people who are eligible for subsidized insurance on the exchanges.        
The staff report, from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, expressed concern about the security of information that would be made available to insurance counselors who are supposed to educate consumers and help them enroll. The counselors, known as navigators, will often have access to Social Security numbers, dates of birth, home and e-mail addresses, and income data for people seeking insurance and for members of their households, the report said.        
Moreover, it said, “There are already reports from across the country that scam artists are attempting to impersonate navigators and assisters to steal credit card information and personally identifiable information in order to take advantage of massive confusion about Obamacare.”        
But Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said, “We will not tolerate anyone seeking to defraud consumers in the health insurance marketplace.”        
Ms. Sebelius met at the White House on Wednesday with Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission officials to discuss ways to prevent, investigate and prosecute consumer fraud and privacy violations. In a warning to consumers, Daniel R. Levinson, the inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services, said anyone making unsolicited calls requesting personal information “may be trying to steal your identity.”        
The exchanges and another major provision of the 2010 health care law, the expansion of Medicaid, are expected to provide coverage for 25 million people by 2016.        
The administration issued new projections on Wednesday indicating that the growth of national health spending, which has been extraordinarily low by historical standards, would pick up with the expansion of coverage, improvements in the economy and the aging of the baby boom generation.        
The estimates, published in the journal Health Affairs, indicate that national health spending will grow by 3.8 percent this year and by 6.1 percent in 2014, to $3.1 trillion. By 2022, national health spending will reach $5 trillion, or 19.9 percent of the total output of goods and services, up from 17.9 percent of the gross domestic product last year, the government said.        
Gigi A. Cuckler, an economist at the Department of Health and Human Services and principal author of the study, said the new health care law would add one-tenth of one percentage point to the average annual growth in health spending from 2012 to 2022. This, she said, will “increase cumulative health spending by $621 billion.”

Russian border guards detained two activists from the environmentalist group Greenpeace early Wednesday morning after they boarded an oil rig to protest drilling in the Arctic by a state gas company. Border guards fired a warning shot from an automatic rifle by the ship that ferried the protesters to the oil rig in the Pechora Sea in Russia’s Arctic waters, the Federal Security Service said in a statement. The statement said that the warning shot was fired for the protesters’ failure to “cease illegal activity” and “the real danger to the gas and oil complex.” Maria Favorskaya, a Greenpeace Russia representative, said the organization was in contact with Russian law enforcement but had not spoken with the activists, Sini Saarela of Finland and Marco Polo of Switzerland, since they were detained Wednesday morning.

NEWARK — The eager fans waited for Brittney Griner. They waited to marvel at her 6-foot-8-inch frame. They waited to give her a hug. They waited to give her gifts, like a white bow tie with rhinestones. They waited to ask her questions, about her first dunk, about her advice for younger players.        


Last week the Liberty honored Katie Smith, a two-time W.N.B.A. champion and the No. 2 scorer in league history, in the final home game of her 16-year career. It was clear, though, that most fans went to Prudential Center to see Griner, the rookie center for the Phoenix Mercury, who received the loudest ovation during player introductions.        
The fans cheered when Griner began the game by beating everyone else down the court for an acrobatic alley-oop layup assisted by her star teammate Diana Taurasi. They oohed when Griner recorded a block in the final minute to secure an 80-76 victory.        
Griner finished with only 9 points, but she understands that the numbers in the seats are as vital as her numbers in the box score.        
All year she has said yes to requests for pictures and autographs before and after games. She accepts gifts and answers fans’ questions with a smile, sometimes while still in her sweat-soaked jersey more than 20 minutes after a game.        
“You learn to embrace it when you have a lot of expectations that’s being put on you all the time,” Griner said. “It doesn’t really bother me anymore.”        
In her rookie season, Griner has achieved what the W.N.B.A. desperately needed her to do: she has attracted more fans.        
With the W.N.B.A. playoffs beginning Thursday, the league’s shift in branding and promotion, with a focus on Griner and other top rookies, has been a success. Ticket sales during the regular season improved by 8.9 percent. Games on ESPN2 averaged 231,000 viewers, a 28 percent jump from a year ago. Traffic on the league’s Web site has increased, too.        
“We couldn’t have been more thrilled with how this season is going,” Laurel Richie, the W.N.B.A. president, said in a telephone interview. “We’ve focused a lot of our efforts on storytelling, both about the game and our players.”        
Last year, average attendance was 7,457, a record low for the league. It was the sixth time in seven years that the average was below 8,000. More than half of the league’s 12 teams did not report a profit. Television viewership dropped. The Web site 24/7 Wall Street predicted that the W.N.B.A. would not exist after 2013.        
To renew interest, Richie made drastic changes before the W.N.B.A.’s 17th season. The league received a rebranding, with a new logo, Web site and color scheme. ESPN extended its contract with the W.N.B.A. through the 2022 season and televised its draft in prime time.        
The league’s biggest promotional efforts, and optimism, focused on its top three draft picks: Griner, Elena Delle Donne and Skylar Diggins. Even before they had finished their college careers, the W.N.B.A. was marketing them as “3 to See.”        
Raymond Sauer, a sports economics professor at Clemson, said it was wise for the league to put faith in Griner. Sauer said Griner’s ability to dunk, along with her engaging personality and her stance to stop bullying, made her fascinating.        
“One of the reasons we watch sports in general is to see people do incredible things,” Sauer said. “A player like that can really make a difference.”        
Griner, 22, has not had a remarkable season statistically, averaging 12.6 points, 6.3 rebounds and a league-leading 3 blocks per game. But behind Griner and Taurasi, who is second in scoring at 20.3 points per game, the Mercury are back in the playoffs one year after finishing 7-27. The Mercury, who will begin a series against the Los Angeles Sparks on Thursday, also led the league in new season-ticket holders and increased their ticket revenue by 35 percent.        
Griner said she was still adjusting to a more physical style of play than what she faced in college at Baylor.        
“It’s rough out there, and that’s what I expected,” said Griner, who missed seven games with a left knee sprain. “I put some high expectations on myself. I feel like I should just do so much more than what I do.”        
Taurasi, the No. 1 overall pick in 2004, said she did not face the same demands when she was the new face of the league.        
“I understand all the pressure that’s on her and all the commitment she has to do that people don’t see,” Taurasi said. “It’s tough as a young kid and still trying to physically make sure you’re playing to your potential. I think she’s starting to figure it out.”        
Delle Donne, drafted second by the Chicago Sky, has been one of the top players in the league, averaging 18.1 points per game. The leading vote-getter for the All-Star Game, Delle Donne has elevated the Sky to a franchise-best 24-10 record and their first playoff appearance. The Sky’s attendance rose 17 percent from last year, the largest increase by any team.        
Diggins, one of the first athletes to sign with Jay Z’s sports agency, had an up-and-down season, averaging 8.5 points and starting 21 games for the Tulsa Shock, who missed the playoffs. But by the All-Star break, the Shock led the W.N.B.A. in merchandise sales, and Griner, Delle Donne and Diggins had the top-selling jerseys.        
“I think 20 years from now we’re going to look back and say that was a defining moment in the history of the W.N.B.A.,” Richie said of the rookie class.        
The league has had other success stories this season. The Minnesota Lynx (26-8) have the best record in the league behind Maya Moore, the No. 1 pick in 2011, who has led the team to back-to-back finals. Tina Thompson, the W.N.B.A.’s career scoring leader, is in the playoffs with the Seattle Storm, averaging 14.1 points a game in her final season. Last week, the Shock’s Riquna Williams broke the single-game scoring record with 51 points.        
“Nobody expected that,” Griner said of Williams’s feat. “But that’s great for our league, too. It shows that we’re some hoopers. I loved it.”        
The W.N.B.A. will face a bigger test next season. Another Griner or Delle Donne will probably not come along in next year’s draft. Richie is focusing on how the league can work with ESPN to build on its momentum.        
The league hopes that Griner and others can continue to lure fans. Cole D’Angelo, a 14-year-old from Leonia, N.J., had never watched the W.N.B.A. before this season, but he began rooting for the Mercury. D’Angelo attended his first game with his parents last week to see Griner against the Liberty.        
After the game, at a meet-and-greet event, he asked Griner about her biggest accomplishment. Griner, who acknowledged before the season that she is gay, paused before saying it was her chance to be a role model.        
D’Angelo left Prudential Center more impressed with Griner and the W.N.B.A.        
“What makes this great is that this would never happen at an N.B.A. game,” he said. “You would never get to spend this much time with a star player.”

BRUSSELS — The European Union’s top financial regulator proposed tougher rules for market benchmarks, new oversight that comes after a wave of interest rate-rigging scandals at big banks.         
But the plan represents a step back from earlier proposals, which called for a single regulator to oversee certain benchmarks.        
The effort by the European Commission comes after a multiyear investigation by global regulators into whether financial firms manipulated key interest rates before and after the financial crisis to improve their profits and deflect scrutiny about their health. The fallout from the inquiry, which led to multibillion-dollar fines and criminal charges, prompted a public outcry for changes to the rate-setting process.        
Under the proposal by the commission, national regulators would have the power to investigate possible rigging or conflicts of interests. If they find wrongdoing, they could impose fines of up to 10 percent of a firm’s annual revenue.        
The new rules — which would cover a wide range of benchmarks in areas like energy and currency derivatives, financial contracts and mortgages — would also require banks and other contributors of data used in setting the benchmarks to sign a legally binding code of conduct to be enforced by national supervisors.        
“Market confidence has been undermined by scandals and allegations of benchmark manipulation,” Michel Barnier, the European Union commissioner for financial services, said in a statement on Wednesday. “Today’s proposals will ensure for the first time that all benchmark providers have to be authorized and supervised.”        
But the plan, which still needs approval by European Union governments and the European Parliament, stops short of other initiatives.        
Earlier this year, the government of Britain made rate-rigging a criminal offense, as part of a broad overhaul. British regulators now oversee the rate-setting process for the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a key benchmark at the center of the scandals.        
Facing objections from Britain and parts of the finance sector, the commission backed away from earlier plans to put the European Securities and Markets Authority in charge of day-to-day supervision of various benchmarks. Instead, the agency could have the authority to settle disagreements on major issues among national financial supervisors, who oversee the setting of some benchmarks.        
The proposal “arguably involves unnecessary Europeanization of the supervision of a benchmark, the oversight of which has already been reformed by the U.K. authorities,” said Barney Reynolds, a partner at the law firm Shearman & Sterling in London who advises clients on European and British financial regulation, referring to Libor.        
Some members of the European Parliament vowed to strengthen the rules by putting a European agency in charge.        
“The European Parliament must now seek to revise the commission’s halfhearted proposals,” said Sven Giegold, a German member of Parliament and spokesman for finance issues for the Greens party. “This implies ensuring European supervision of key benchmarks.”

A woman will be allowed to name her 8-month-old son Messiah, a judge ruled Wednesday, overturning an order from another judge who said the name should be changed because “Messiah is a title that is held only by Jesus Christ.” Lu Ann Ballew, a child support magistrate, ordered Jaleesa Martin to change the name at a paternity hearing last month. At an appeal hearing on Wednesday, Chancellor Telford E. Forgety Jr. of Cocke County overturned the decision, finding that the judge had acted unconstitutionally.

A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld California’s transportation fuel standards, which are designed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fuel to 1990 levels by 2020. The district court in 2011 had ruled that the state’s low carbon fuel standards discriminated against fuels produced outside California, violating Congress’s power to regulate interstate trade. Wednesday’s appeals court decision lifted a partial injunction on the state’s program. The standards were the first of their kind in the country, and regulated the carbon emitted during the production, transportation and use of fuel. Other states have since considered adopting their own limits. American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, one of the organizations that challenged the law, said it was “evaluating its options.”

His four felony embezzlement counts were reduced to two misdemeanor charges under a plea agreement approved by Judge Margaret Spencer in Richmond. The tangled case brought to light allegations of misconduct against Gov. Bob McDonnell and entangled Attorney General Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the Republican candidate for governor.

Sheriff Bruce Peoples of Custer County said Wednesday that investigators were confident that one of two cars pulled from the bottom of Foss Lake contained the remains of three teenagers who disappeared in 1970 on their way to a football game. The cars were found Tuesday by divers on a training exercise. The state medical examiner’s office said it believes that the remains of six people were recovered from the cars, which were found near a marina. Sheriff Peoples said one of the cars was a Chevrolet Camaro that appeared to match the description of the vehicle the teenagers were in. He said the second car may be linked to the 1969 disappearance of three other people. Investigators were working to find other cold cases that might match the discovery. The sheriff said it was possible that people simply drove into the lake and drowned.

After losing the Democratic primary last week by a wide margin, District Attorney Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn promised a smooth transition to his opponent, even though he was still on the Republican ticket. But now his political future has become murkier: while Mr. Hynes says on the record that he is not running as a Republican, three people close to him are saying that he is, indeed, considering it.        


On primary night, when he suffered a 10-point loss to his challenger, Kenneth P. Thompson, Mr. Hynes said that he would not continue to campaign for a seventh term. Yet Republican leaders are urging him to try again — in part because they believe that having Mr. Hynes campaign as a Republican could draw voters to Joseph J. Lhota, the party’s nominee for mayor. And Mr. Hynes has not quite shut the door on that possibility.        
Though Mr. Hynes told Mr. Thompson he was ready to start the transition process, his top advisers have been exploring a Republican run, asking others with experience in Brooklyn politics whether he would stand a chance, said City Councilman Lewis A. Fidler, an old friend of Mr. Hynes.        
Mr. Fidler said that he had not spoken to Mr. Hynes, who is on vacation, but that those close to the district attorney were “taking the conversation very seriously.”        
But Mr. Fidler, a Democrat, said he would not advise Mr. Hynes to run in a borough where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 800,000. “I think in the end, a certain realism is going to set in,” he said.        
Another person close to Mr. Hynes said the district attorney had backed away from his resolution not to run as others, including State Senator Martin J. Golden, who is a Republican, and Mr. Lhota’s advisers, urged him to reconsider.        
Reached by phone, Mr. Hynes said that “nothing has changed” since the primary. “I said after I lost the primary that I would not actively seek re-election on the Republican or Conservative line,” he said. “I’m giving you a very clear, definitive answer.”        
Yet when asked if he would tell Republican leaders not to campaign on his behalf, he said: “I’m the nominee of two legitimate parties and I will remain as the nominee through the general election. For me to do anything else would be disrespectful of the leadership who gave me the nomination in the first place.”        
Mr. Hynes’s campaign manager, Dennis Quirk, did not rule out a run, saying no decision would be made until Mr. Hynes returned next week. Mr. Quirk said the impetus for Mr. Hynes to run was coming from Republicans, not the district attorney.        
“He really can’t tell the Republican Party not to campaign,” Mr. Quirk said. As for Mr. Hynes’s chances, he said, “It’s a far stretch, but it could happen.”        
Mr. Hynes has been a Democrat for all of his nearly 24 years as district attorney, but he secured places on the Republican and Conservative Party ballot lines this year. Mr. Golden and other Republicans have told him he could win with a coalition of Republicans and Democrats who did not vote in the primary but may support him.        
Mr. Golden noted that primary turnout was low, with about 22 percent of Democrats voting.        
Mr. Golden said there was another reason Republicans wanted Mr. Hynes to campaign. “It helps Joe Lhota,” who will need substantial support from Democrats to win, Mr. Golden said. “I think they’d be a good team.”        
A spokeswoman for Mr. Lhota declined to comment.        
In a statement, Mr. Thompson’s spokesman, James Freedland, said Mr. Hynes had pledged to exit the race and offered Mr. Thompson space in his office.        
“We will take Mr. Hynes at his word that he will not be running as a Republican in November after a lifetime in the Democratic Party,” Mr. Freedland said.

MINERVA, N.Y. — A 250-foot waterfall, one of the tallest in the Northeast, tumbles over giant slabs of marble. A chain of 13 crystalline lakes and ponds teems with bass and lake trout. A 10-mile stretch of the Hudson River gorge winds through dense stands of hemlock, white pine and red maple.        


These natural features make up the more than 21,000 acres of the Adirondacks that were recently purchased by New York State from the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit organization. By October, the land will be entirely opened to the public for the first time in more than a century. It is now part of the forest preserve, allowing visitors to experience a resplendent landscape in the heart of the six-million-acre state park.        
But while environmentalists, town officials, paddlers, boaters, hikers and snowmobilers have embraced the pristine wilderness, they now find themselves in a tug of war over how the land should be enjoyed. Should it be reserved for quiet recreation like canoeing, rafting and hiking? Or should it also be open to cars, motorboats and Jet Skis? It is a debate that has long torn at the Adirondacks, and it revolves around an invisible entity: noise.        
“It is a spectacular resource,” said Joseph Martens, commissioner of the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation, of the new forest preserve lands. “The challenge is to find a way to make that resource accessible to a wide variety of people — meaning the elderly, disabled and families — but that doesn’t damage the resource itself. It’s a balancing act. You have to respect both objectives.”        
The question comes down to whether the Adirondack Park Agency, which governs land use in the park, should designate the land as “wilderness,” which prohibits the use of motorized vehicles, or “wild forest,” which allows them.        
The Nature Conservancy has remained neutral, but several other environmental groups, including Protect the Adirondacks, the Adirondack Council and the Adirondack Mountain Club, are pressing for a wilderness designation. The land was part of a much larger acquisition in 2007 by the Nature Conservancy, which purchased 161,000 acres from a local timber company. The $110 million deal, which included 90 mountain peaks and 300 lakes and ponds, was hailed as a milestone in the history of Adirondack Park, a remote patchwork of private and public lands in upstate New York.        
After meeting with local officials and residents, the Nature Conservancy decided to preserve 92,000 acres as active timberland through sustainable logging, a move that used the state purchase of development rights to save both jobs and the land’s open character.        
The group also won a commitment from the state to buy 65,000 acres in installments over five years and add them to the forest preserve, which is off-limits to development and logging.        
This first section to be bought by the state is broken up into a few parcels. The debate centers mainly on the largest of them, a 17,320-acre area known as the Essex chain of lakes tract, a network of lakes and ponds in Essex County, as well as a 925-acre stretch of land along the Indian River.        
There are several different proposals for those two parcels, allowing varying levels of motorized access. (Another 2,780 acres that includes the waterfall, called OK Slip Falls, would be classified as wilderness under each alternative.)        
In a study of the 200 largest lakes in the Adirondacks, Protect the Adirondacks determined that only a dozen were off-limits to motorboats and float planes. Half of those were difficult to access, requiring long hikes through woods. The group is lobbying for Alternative 1a., which it calls “wilderness with access,” allowing visitors of all abilities to park their cars within a short hike of the Essex lakes chain.        
“We have great mountains that are wilderness, and incredible stretches of forest that are wild,” said Peter Bauer, executive director of Protect the Adirondacks. “But we don’t have that many big lakes where people can get a wilderness experience that is timeless.”        
But for other residents and elected officials whose towns encompass the recently acquired land, motorized access is seen as critical to revitalizing the Adirondacks’ beleaguered economy. “Making those connections is essential to building economic opportunity,” said Sue Montgomery Corey, supervisor of the town of Minerva, which includes part of both the Essex chain of lakes tract and Indian River tract.        
“We would like to be able to snowmobile, ride or hike to the other communities,” Ms. Corey said at a public hearing held by the Adirondack Park Agency. “Hiking in three miles carrying a canoe from an access point will not work for most seniors or most young families.”        
The agency received nearly 4,000 written comments that leaned four to one in favor of “wilderness” protection, while spoken testimony tilted slightly in favor of “wild forest.” Later this year, the agency will submit a recommendation to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. In the meantime, the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation has weighed in with its own preference: Alternative 4b., “wild forest” but with a “special management area” that would provide flexibility to limit motor use.        
In a phone interview, Mr. Martens said that the special management area could, for instance, give the state leeway to restrict motorboats to those with quiet electric engines and allow more motorized access during the less busy “shoulder seasons” of spring and fall.        
For the Nature Conservancy, however, the significance of adding tens of thousands of acres to the forest preserve transcends the battle over noise versus silence, paddles versus propellers.        
“It’s a point that gets forgotten in the classification debate,” said Michelle Brown, a conservation scientist for the group’s Adirondack chapter. “This land will never be developed or harvested for timber. It’s forever wild.”

Dr. Stephen Malawista, an infectious-disease researcher who orchestrated the detective work that in the mid-1970s led to the discovery of Lyme disease, died on Wednesday at his home in Hamden, Conn. He was 79.        


The cause was metastatic melanoma, his wife, Tobé, said.        
Lyme disease begins with the transmission of bacteria through the bite of a black-legged tick and can spread to muscles, joints, the heart and even the brain. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Lyme disease is diagnosed in 300,000 Americans each year.        
Many scientists contributed to today’s understanding of Lyme disease. But a team led by Dr. Malawista, as chief of rheumatology at the Yale School of Medicine, and Allen C. Steere, then a postdoctoral student, is widely credited with defining the ailment. Their work was recognized in 1985 with the Ciba-Geigy-ILAR Rheumatology Prize, a prestigious honor in arthritis research.        
In presenting the award, Dr. George E. Ehrlich, a vice president at Ciba-Geigy, the pharmaceutical giant, hailed the achievement as “a truly magnificent piece of medical detective work.”        
“There are few examples in modern times of a single team accomplishing so much in such an elegant way,” Dr. Ehrlich said.        
The story began in fall 1975, when two mothers — one from Lyme, Conn., the other from adjacent Old Lyme — were distressed by the odd rashes, neurological symptoms and swollen joints that their families and others were experiencing. Unable to find answers and frustrated, each approached Yale independently.        
The initial diagnosis was juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, but that disease had never been known to appear in bunches. Doctors at Yale counted 51 cases, a rate about 100 times what would have been expected to occur in a combined population of 12,000 in the towns of Lyme, Old Lyme and East Haddam. The cases had also occurred almost exclusively in warm-weather months.        
“Here was a disease that by its clustering — it was clustering in time, it was clustering in space, it was clustering in families and on roads — it really looked like there was a vector, something that transmits the disease, such as an insect,” Dr. Malawista was quoted as saying in the book “Bull’s-Eye: Unraveling the Medical Mystery of Lyme Disease” (Yale University Press, 2003), by Dr. Jonathan A. Edlow.        
The researchers reported on the peculiar clustering and named it Lyme arthritis — Dr. Malawista’s idea — in the journal Arthritis and Rheumatism in January 1977. A second article six months later suggested that antibiotics could help in some cases but not in others, which is still medicine’s essential view.        
Dr. Malawista and his team made the compelling link between ticks and the disease by noting that cases were 30 times more frequent on the east side of the Connecticut River, where Lyme is situated, than on the west side. Ticks feed and breed on deer, and there are far more deer on the east side.        
Dr. Steere told Dr. Edlow that their success had derived largely from Dr. Malawista’s management style. “He does allow people at least the potential for a lot of autonomy,” Dr. Steere said.        
But the Yale researchers were wrong in their initial judgment that the disease is caused by a virus — and even wrong that it was truly a new disease. Their announcement that it was caused by only one type of tick did not bear out. When symptoms turned out to be much more diverse than arthritis, they changed the name to Lyme disease.        
Nonetheless, their effort to study a malady that was soon causing anguish well beyond Connecticut put them at the center of Lyme disease research. In 1984, Yale held the first international conference on the disease.        
Dr. Willy Burgdorfer, working for the National Institutes of Health in Montana, found the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in 1982. Yale scientists then developed a vaccine, which was licensed in 1998. It was taken off the market in 2002.        
Lyme disease remains treatable if not always curable. An antibiotic treatment usually wipes out the infection. If it does not, another course of antibiotics might be administered, sometimes intravenously. But bacteria can persist in the body, causing harm and illness months or even years after treatment has ended.        
Stephen Evan Malawista was born on April 4, 1934, in Manhattan. His father, Lawrence, was a real estate developer. His mother, Ann Marlowe Straus, was a theatrical producer and chairwoman of the Berkshire Theater Festival in Massachusetts.        
He was accepted at Harvard at 15 and studied experimental psychology with the behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner. Mr. Malawista graduated magna cum laude and earned his medical degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. After deciding to focus on inflammation, he spent two years at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases. He joined the Yale faculty in 1966 and was chief of rheumatology for 21 years.        
After his team discovered Lyme disease, he was described as thrilled that it could lead to an understanding of how joint inflammation can arise from infection. He was considered a leader in furthering understanding of how the interaction of different kinds of white blood cells drives inflammation.        
In 1994, the American College of Rheumatology presented Dr. Malawista with its Distinguished Basic Investigator Award, praising his creativity in addressing problems. “He recognizes the kernels of the unknown in them,” the citation said, “surrounds them with the known, and searches through this mechanism for insight in how to answer the questions that exist.”        
Dr. Malawista, who shared his mother’s love of theater and music, started a vocal chamber music group with his wife, the former Tobé Anne Miller.        
Dr. Malawista is also survived by his half-brother, David Malawista; and his stepsister, Penny Ritscher Staccioli.        
Dr. Malawista remained fascinated by Lyme disease, about which many questions remain. One puzzle is how the disease can reappear more than a dozen years after the initial infection. He compared that phenomenon to the dog that did not bark in a Sherlock Holmes mystery. “What is the immune system if not a guard dog?” he asked. “Why has it stopped responding to the spirochetes in its midst?”

Albert Taylor, a former United States Border Patrol agent who came to be regarded as a legend in the art of tracking in the wild — sensing in shifting sand or broken twigs the sparest of signals that someone had passed that way — died on Sept. 9 in Alpine, Calif. He was 88.        


He had Alzheimer’s disease, his son Kenneth said in confirming the death.        
Mr. Taylor, who was known as Ab, honed his skill at tracking people in the rugged backcountry of Southern California during nearly three decades with the Border Patrol. He played a key role in developing a national program to teach children what to do if they become lost.        
“Thousands of tracking students owe their individual and corporate understanding, knowledge and tracking skill to this one dynamic man,” Joel Hardin, a leading professional tracker in Idaho, wrote in an online tribute.        
Tracking people across wilderness, whether a fleeing fugitive or a lost child, is a “weird, mystical art” that blends intense attention and intuition, said Paul Saffo, a consultant and analyst in Silicon Valley who is involved in search and rescue efforts in the Bay Area. But Mr. Taylor, he said, became “an absolute legend” by pioneering a systematic approach to tracking that could be taught.        
In 1990 Mr. Taylor published “Fundamentals of Mantracking,” which he wrote with Donald C. Cooper. The book described his methodical approach of using well-trained searchers.        
“In searching,” the authors wrote, “more people is seldom better. Sheer numbers do not guarantee success. Neither do millions of dollars or sophisticated equipment.”        
In fact, the book warns, “The large, untrained, disorganized groups, all too characteristic of searches done in this country, cost far more lives than they save.”        
Perhaps his most important contribution to the field resulted from failure. In February 1981, a 9-year-old boy named Jimmy Beveridge was separated from his two brothers on a nature trail on Palomar Mountain, northeast of San Diego. Mr. Taylor was among some 400 searchers who combed the area for the boy for four days before finding the body. Jimmy had died of hypothermia.        
Mr. Taylor said it was the first time in 31 years of tracking that he had not found a missing child. “It changed his life,” Kenneth Taylor said.        
Mr. Taylor was part of a team that developed Hug-a-Tree and Survive, a program that teaches children how to stay safe if they become lost and increase their chances of being found.        
Along with wilderness survival training, children are taught to “find a spot where you’re comfortable and stay put,” said Howard Paul, a board member of the National Association for Search and Rescue, which now manages the program.        
“Let the searchers come to you,” he said.        
The message is important, Mr. Paul said, because a lost child runs the risk of leaving an area that has not yet been searched and wandering into an area that had already been searched. The program’s first presentation, a slide show, featured one of Mr. Taylor’s grandchildren.        
Jacquie Beveridge, Jimmy’s mother, said in an interview that Mr. Taylor had been instrumental in popularizing the program among search-and-rescue organizations around the country. “It was Ab’s name and reputation that helped catapult the program,” she said.        
Albert Snow Taylor was born on Nov. 24, 1924, in San Angelo, Tex. According to family lore, he was too young to enlist in the military in World War II but was so eager to join the effort that he quit high school and traveled to Britain to work for Boeing, repairing B-17s that had returned from bombing runs. When he was eligible to enlist, he came back to the United States and served in the Navy aboard the aircraft carrier Hancock. He joined the Border Patrol in 1949.        
In an interview, Mr. Hardin, who was trained by Mr. Taylor during their Border Patrol days, called him a “hell-on-wheels individual, if you will.” Mr. Taylor, he said, could get agents to work around the clock for days on end in an investigation.        
“He could figure out how to get the job done when nobody else could,” Mr. Hardin said.        
After retiring from government service in the late 1970s, Mr. Taylor was a technical adviser to “Borderline,” a 1980 film loosely based on his Border Patrol career, featuring Charles Bronson, Bruno Kirby and Ed Harris; Mr. Taylor had a small role as a border patrolman.        
He was married three times. Besides his son Kenneth, he is survived by his wife, the former Lillian Beam; two other children from his first marriage, Stuart and Patti; three stepchildren, Rick, Kenny and Kevin Beam; two sisters, Barbara Tolch and Marjorie Grubb; 14 grandchildren; and 16 great-grandchildren.        
By the 1990s, Mr. Taylor and Lillian Taylor were traveling six months a year in a motor home, leading tracking seminars and presenting Hug-a-Tree programs around the country.        
Robert J. Koester, a researcher at Kingston University in London, who maintains a large database of search and rescue incidents, said, “Several areas around the country where Hug-a-Tree has been taught have reported a drop in the number of lost-children search incidents.”        
Mr. Taylor “reawakened” search-and-rescue groups to practical tracking methods, Mr. Koester said, adding, “I’m sure his saves number in the thousands.”

In an era when most city and state agencies struggle under the weight of budget constraints, the Manhattan district attorney’s office this year found itself in an unusual position: sitting on a veritable windfall.        


In December, federal and state authorities secured a record $1.92 billion payment from HSBC Bank to settle charges that the banking giant transferred billions of dollars for nations under sanction by the United States, enabled Mexican drug cartels to launder tainted money through the American financial system, and worked closely with Saudi Arabian banks linked to terrorist organizations.        
For its role in the investigation, the Manhattan district attorney’s office cashed a check this week for $169 million — slightly more than twice its total annual budget of $80 million.        
Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said the money would help lower crime in public housing projects, modernize courtroom technology, increase cybercrime investigative capabilities and add programs to help keep children out of the criminal justice system.        
“This is an unprecedented opportunity to enhance public safety in New York City,” Mr. Vance said. “We are sharing these funds with our colleagues in all five boroughs, so that this investment of funds benefits all of New York City.”        
The payment was the largest ever made by the Department of Justice to a single law enforcement agency in the nearly three decades it has been sharing assets seized or forfeited by defendants in criminal investigations, said Mythili Raman, acting assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice’s criminal division.        
Under Robert M. Morgenthau, the former Manhattan district attorney, the office began investigating multinational banks that were disguising the identities of clients in countries on United States sanction lists by stripping their names from paperwork.        
Settlements with banks by Mr. Vance’s office have added $900 million in the last four years to the city and state general funds, without any guarantee that the money would be used on public safety measures. The new settlement money is arriving through a different financing stream with a requirement that it be spent on law enforcement purposes, and not on continuing salaries.        
The money from such settlements has at times raised contentious issues.        
In 2009, as Mr. Morgenthau was about to leave office, the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg apparently sought to embarrass him by raising questions about dozens of unregistered bank accounts controlled by his office that held tens of millions of dollars from settlements, forfeitures and seizures.        
The city later acknowledged it had thousands of similar accounts that had not been registered with the city comptroller’s office, as is required. John C. Liu, the city comptroller, later said the district attorney’s office should register all its accounts. Mr. Vance agreed, and the new settlement money is going into registered accounts, his office said.        
Because the amount of money is so large, the Department of Justice required that spending plans be approved in advance. The department also requires an annual audit of expenditures by an external auditor.        
Working with the office of the mayor’s criminal justice coordinator, John Feinblatt, Mr. Vance’s office has been making plans for the money for several months. Federal guidelines would allow Mr. Vance to direct the money exclusively to his own office — for things as prosaic as new cars or a new office building — but his office chose to share the wealth across the city’s law enforcement agencies.        
Mr. Vance said he expected that the money would allow for an increase in his department’s capacity to forensically analyze electronic devices, something that has become a major component of many investigations, and help other district attorneys in the city do the same. The New York Police Department will also probably receive some of the money.

The mother of a 23-year-old woman who was electrocuted by a downed power line in Queens during Hurricane Sandy filed a wrongful-death lawsuit on Wednesday against Consolidated Edison, accusing the power company of negligence in failing to shut down the electricity before the storm hit.        


The woman, Lauren Abraham, “burned alive, writhing and screaming” for 30 minutes while her neighbors and friends watched helplessly, unable to touch her because the wire was still live, the complaint says.        
Ms. Abraham, a makeup artist, was killed on Oct. 29 when she walked outside of her home to take photographs.        
“The flames grew so large that one neighbor did not even realize that a person was being burned,” the complaint says.        
The complaint filed by Ms. Abraham’s mother, Kim Tinnin, accuses Con Edison of negligence and seeks unspecified damages. It says emergency personnel had to watch Ms. Abraham burn while the utility took about two hours to shut down the source of electricity to the power line.        
Ms. Abraham, who went by the nickname LolaDiva on YouTube, worked out of a studio in her parents’ home. She had recently graduated from beauty school and was studying at the City University of New York’s Lehman College, according to her Facebook page.        
A Con Ed spokesman, Bob McGee, said the company had not yet been served with a file copy of the complaint. “This was a tragedy caused” by the hurricane, Mr. McGee said. “We’ll address the matter in court.”

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Jason Pierre-Paul, widely considered the Giants’ best defensive player, knows what has been said about his play in the first two games.        


“People are saying they haven’t seen the old J. P. P,” Pierre-Paul said after practice Wednesday. “I look at the tape of the games. I haven’t seen the old J. P. P. either.”        
Pierre-Paul had back surgery in June, sat out the preseason and did not resume practicing with the team until a week before the opening game at Dallas.        
“I’m fine, my back does not hurt at all,” he said. “That’s a good thing. But that doesn’t mean everything is back from a football-playing standpoint. I’m not playing like I used to, because my brain is thinking what to do, but my body isn’t responding yet.        
“I’m getting healthier, and it’s getting better, but it isn’t there yet.”        
Pierre-Paul described his play against Dallas as “terrible.” He said he thought he was average in the loss to Denver on Sunday.        
“So I am improving, and that includes improving in practice,” said Pierre-Paul, a defensive end with six tackles. “I’m doing some good things; I’m just getting to the quarterback a second late. Hopefully, on Sunday I’ll get there in time.        
“It’s only been two games, but I watch on tape, and I see myself stopping a lot. I look at the screen, and I’m like, ‘That’s not me.’ I don’t know what the heck I’m doing. I looked at the film from the Cowboys game a year ago, and it was totally different. You can see it. But there’s no excuses. I just have to get my body right, and I’ll get back to the old me.”        
Pierre-Paul leads the team with one sack, which says a lot about the pass rush heading into Sunday’s game on the road against the Carolina Panthers.        
COUGHLIN’S BROTHER DIES Coach Tom Coughlin’s younger brother, John, died Monday at Hackensack Medical Center in New Jersey, the team announced. John Coughlin, 63, was a horse trainer who owned and operated Coughlin’s Stables in East Rutherford.        
“Our family is thankful for the expressions of sympathy and prayers for our brother John’s passing,” Coughlin said in a statement released by the team. “We all appreciate them. John was a friend to all. He loved life, and he will be greatly missed. He left us way too soon.”        
Services for John Coughlin will be Monday and Tuesday near Waterloo, N.Y., the small town where the Coughlins — John, Tom and five sisters — were raised.        
“I’m sure that’s a tough thing, losing your only brother,” Eli Manning said. “He talked to us about that.”        
Victor Cruz added: “When he addressed us, it was an emotional thing for me. I think the team understands what he’s going through, and we’ll respond.”        
Coughlin has been present for the team’s usual schedule of practices, meetings and film study this week.        
“He’s focusing on us,” Manning said. “I’m sure he will do what he has to do for his family. Maybe the best thing we can do for him is to have a great week of practice and get a win on Sunday.”        
THE GOOD AND BAD OF 0-2 Much has been made this week of the Giants 0-2 start, especially since the 2007 Giants also lost their first two games and ended up winning the Super Bowl.        
The 2007 team was not the first Giants team to turn an 0-2 record into a championship. The 1934 Giants were 0-2, losing badly to Detroit and Green Bay, and then won 9 of their next 12 games to claim the N.F.L. championship.        
But an 0-2 start by a Giants team does not ordinarily establish a good final outcome for the season. It has happened 16 times besides 1934 and 2007. Twelve times it led to a losing season, and often it foreshadowed spectacularly miserable records: 3-11 in 1976; 2-12 in 1974; 2-10-2 in 1964; and 5-11 in 1995.        
The overall record of the 18 Giants teams that started 0-2, including the squad that played the first season in franchise history in 1925, is 101-140-6. Of the 18 teams that started 0-2, 11 were soon 0-3.

DENVER — The San Rafael Swell, with its miles of twisting sandstone spires and towering mesas, has long been a draw for hiking and canyoneering, and has even been considered for designation as a national monument.        


So last month, when the federal Bureau of Land Management announced its intention to open portions of the 2,000-square-mile stretch of central Utah for drilling by private oil and gas companies, conservation groups reacted with alarm.        
The debate over the proposed sale of drilling leases has rekindled tensions between those seeking to shield wilderness areas, and the Obama administration, which has come under pressure from oil and gas companies to develop more public lands as it pursues a policy of energy independence.        
For nearly 100 years, the bureau has leased tracts of federally managed land to energy companies, which have sought to tap reserves in oil- and gas-rich states like Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. Disputes over the location of the drilling are not uncommon.        
But the announcement that dozens of parcels would be auctioned off in the Swell, a largely untouched geologic formation, came as a surprise to environmental groups, who are worried that the administration’s energy strategy is shifting away from its promise to be environmentally sensitive.        
“We were very surprised and disappointed to see this turn of events,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. “It’s a step backwards. To see a place like the San Rafael Swell be put up on the chopping block makes no sense.”        
On Monday, the Utah group, along with several other conservation organizations, filed a formal protest with the bureau, asking that it withdraw 55 of the proposed leases. The groups claimed the bureau had not sufficiently weighed the environmental consequences of opening parts of the Swell for drilling.        
Bureau officials say that recent policy changes intended to slow the leasing process now ensure that tracts of land, like those within the Swell, are carefully examined before drilling is allowed. And they have disputed assertions that they are appeasing energy companies, which have been critical of the administration for being too restrictive.        
“The B.L.M. is continuing to move towards full implementation of more environmentally responsible approaches to oil and gas development as outlined in our May 2010 leasing reforms,” wrote Celia Boddington, a bureau spokeswoman, in an e-mail. “Nationally, implementation is a work in progress but we are already seeing positive results.”        
According to bureau data, formal protests lodged over controversial leases were down, to 317 last year from 1,475 in 2009. Leases are also down. In the 2012 fiscal year, some 1,729 were issued, the fewest in any year for a decade, according to bureau data.        
The leasing program has faced less opposition recently than it did during the Bush administration, when conservation organizations were mired in legal battles with the federal government over how tracts of land were sold.        
Those disputes boiled over during the end of Mr. Bush’s presidency, when 77 oil and gas leases were sold near Utah’s national parks and recreation areas.        
An environmental activist, Tim DeChristopher, went to prison for buying nearly $1.8 million worth of the leases without ever intending to pay.        
In 2009, Ken Salazar, the interior secretary, withdrew the leases, saying they had been rushed. A year later, the leasing program was revamped, seeking to better clarify which lands were appropriate for drilling.        
Now, after energy companies nominate leases, state bureau offices must undertake a more stringent environmental review and leave more time for public comment before the auctions.        
But environmental groups say those changes have been slow to take hold, and that parcels are being put up for lease in areas where they had fended off oil and gas drilling in the past.        
In 2012 in Colorado, the bureau offered parcels near Mesa Verde National Park for lease, only to defer them before a February auction this year. A variety of organizations, including the state’s parks and wildlife agency and the National Park Service, raised concerns about the leases. Environmental groups said they expected the land to be proposed for leasing again.        
In Utah, which has long been ground zero for the fight over public lands, environmentalists noted that the bureau itself considered some parts of the Swell to have wilderness characteristics.        
The area does not, however, have federal protections that would bar drilling altogether. In 2002, Gov. Mike Leavitt suggested that the Bush administration designate a portion of the Swell as a national monument, but changed his mind after local residents opposed the idea.        
And there are some who want to see development move forward.        
“The environmental groups that are complaining don’t really know where the leases are or don’t care,” said Commissioner Jeff Horrocks of Emery County, who said many in the mineral-rich area felt the Swell could be developed while also preserving the environment.        
Cody Stewart, energy adviser to Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah, said that Mr. Herbert had no issue with the leases, and that there were other parts of the Swell that better warranted protection.        
“We don’t see these leases as in high-priority conservation areas,” he said.        
Whether the land ultimately goes to auction, slated for November, is unclear.        
Juan Palma, Utah director for the Bureau of Land Management, said the bureau was reviewing concerns about drilling in the Swell.        
The bureau recently removed about 1,000 acres from the parcels set aside for auction — though the Utah wilderness group noted that that was only a small portion of the contested leases.

It is a magnet for nannies and their charges, the site of outdoor Shakespeare productions and a resting spot for visitors to the Carroll Gardens Greenmarket.        


It is also home to numerous benches that attract teenagers who, done with school for the day but not yet ready to go home to other boroughs, linger in small groups for a snack, a snatch of gossip and a game or two of pickup basketball. And sometimes, too, the park draws teenagers from the housing projects at the edges of the neighborhood.        
Two shots fired on Monday evening near Carroll Park, at the heart of the brownstone neighborhood of Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, seemed to fly straight from one world into the other this week, underscoring how even in the leafiest, most coddled of neighborhoods, the city can still show its rougher edges. The police were still investigating the shots, along with a fight involving as many as 20 teenagers a few hours earlier, on Wednesday.        
As speculation grew that a gang from nearby Red Hook, Brooklyn, was responsible for the shooting and the fight, parents who frequent the park with their children exchanged anxious chatter. Others, though, dismissed the episodes as facts of life in an area that has seen rapid gentrification in recent years, but whose calm is still interrupted by the occasional mugging or scuffle in the park.        
“It is a big city,” said Glenn Kelly, 57, who has lived in the neighborhood for 36 years and helped found Friends of Carroll Park, which looks after the park. When he first led the group in the early 1990s, graffiti and vandalism were common, he said; now the playgrounds are crowded with young children.        
“I don’t mean to dismiss what has happened,” Mr. Kelly said, “but we don’t gain anything by getting all bent out of shape. This is not unusual in human history — even though it is unusual for our park.”        
News of the episodes spread after Mr. Kelly’s wife, Katia Kelly, wrote about them on her neighborhood blog, Pardon Me for Asking. A local resident had e-mailed Ms. Kelly to say his teenage son had spent several hours in the hospital after being knocked unconscious during the afternoon fight. “Tell your kids to steer clear,” he wrote. No one was hurt in the shooting.        
Though the park was full of children on Wednesday afternoon, the recent violence was not far from parents’ minds.        
“This is where they play before we go to dinner,” said Maria Lozada, holding her toddler daughter. She said that she would be more cautious when teenagers seemed to be gathering in the park, but that she would not stop coming.        
City Councilman Brad Lander, a Democrat who represents Carroll Gardens, said the local police inspector had assured him that the precinct would be sending more plainclothes and uniformed officers to the park area.        
He said there was a “reasonable likelihood” that the afternoon fight and the evening shooting were connected.        
Rubbing up against the brownstones and cafes of Carroll Gardens are the Red Hook and Gowanus housing projects. Several teenagers in the park said the fight had broken out between a gang from the Red Hook Houses and other teenagers.        
“I feel like there’s such a divide in this neighborhood,” said Sophie McKane, who was sharing a cup of frozen yogurt with her young sons on a park bench. “It’s so wealthy and gentrified, but there’s real deprivation alongside incredible wealth.”        
But many of the teenagers who come to the park after school are not from Red Hook or Gowanus, instead living as far away as Harlem, the Bronx, and Crown Heights and Brownsville, both in Brooklyn. They commute by subway every morning from neighborhoods very different from Carroll Gardens.        
To T. J. Smith, 17, a senior at Brooklyn School for Collaborative Studies who said he rides three subway lines from his home in Brownsville to get to school each day, the contrast can be surreal.        
“ ’Cause in Brownsville, things happen every day,” he said. “Here, it’s nice and peaceful and calm.”

FRONT PAGE  
An article on Tuesday about the mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard, using information from law enforcement authorities, misstated, in some copies, the circumstances under which the gunman, Aaron Alexis, entered the facility before the shooting began. He used his valid credentials as a military contractor to get into the base. He did not “shoot his way in.”        
INTERNATIONAL 
An article on Monday about a statement by the Egyptian military that it had taken the upper hand in its campaign to rid Sinai of Islamist militants misidentified the city in Israel where officials are increasingly worried about the persistent security vacuum in the Sinai Desert near the Israeli border. It is Jerusalem, not Tel Aviv.        
•        
Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Sept. 9 with an article about a request by Secretary of State John Kerry that the European Union suspend its planned restrictions on financial assistance to Israeli institutions to show the Israeli public the benefit of pursuing a peace agreement with the Palestinians misidentified the setting of the photograph. It is the Palestinian village of Beit Jala in the West Bank — not Gilo, a nearby Israeli development in Jerusalem.

MUQDADIYA, Iraq — The orange archway at the entrance to this farming community welcomes visitors in “peace.” The lush palm groves are heavy with ripe dates. For generations, Shiite and Sunni families worked the land, earning a living from their sheep and cows, their wheat fields and lemon trees.        


On a recent morning, though, the only talk was of how to stop them from killing one another.        
The latest strategy: new concrete walls with separate entryways for the different sects.        
“So there’s a Sunni way in, and a Shiite way in,” Abu Jassim, a Sunni resident who recently fled his home after sectarian revenge killings by Shiite gunmen, explained to a local representative in Parliament.        
During the worst of Iraq’s carnage over the last decade, this area of Diyala Province, a mixed region where Shiites, Sunni Arabs and Kurds still compete for power, faced killings and displacement. But what is happening now, villagers say, is worse — what one Western diplomat described in an interview as “Balkans-style ethnic cleansing.”        
Iraqi leaders worry that the violence here may be a sign of what awaits the rest of the country if the government cannot quell the growing mayhem that many trace to the civil war in Syria, which has inflamed sectarian divisions, with Sunnis supporting the rebels and Shiites backing the Assad government. Attacks have become more frequent this year, with major bombings becoming almost a daily occurrence. The violence countrywide has increased to a level not seen in five years, according to the United Nations, reinforcing fears that the type of sectarian warfare that gripped the country in 2006 and 2007 will reignite.        
Here in Muqdadiya, perched in the Tigris River valley on the way from Baghdad to the Iranian border, it already has.        
It started in mid-July, when a fragile tranquillity was shattered after a teenage boy, in a baggy T-shirt concealing a vest of explosives, walked into a Shiite funeral tent and detonated himself while mourners ate a dinner of lamb, rice and tomato soup.        
A resurgent Al Qaeda in Iraq was blamed for the bombing, and the bomber, it emerged, was a member of the local Sunni tribe, inflaming not just sectarian hatreds but local tribal rivalries.        
In the days after, locals say, Shiite gunmen, some with ties to militias, others out for tribal justice, terrorized Sunni neighborhoods, killing some and demanding that others leave.        
“It’s worse than anything that ever happened before,” said Ali Jassim, another displaced resident, who, like others interviewed for this article, gave only an informal name, withholding his full name for safety reasons. “It was people attacking at night with machine guns, not considering if there were kids or women or old men.”        
Mr. Jassim said he cowered in his chicken coop with his wife and children as gunmen fired on his home shouting: “You are Sunni, you don’t belong here. We will kill you if you don’t leave.” The next morning, he packed some clothes and mattresses into a minivan and fled to a safer place, leaving his chickens and sheep behind.        
He had lived in that house since 1966, staying even during the worst days of the sectarian war, but now says he will never go back.        
Other residents received fliers on their doorstep, under the name of a prominent Shiite militia and wrapped around a bullet, telling them to leave or be killed, according to residents, officials and a report by Human Rights Watch.        
The increasing role of Shiite militias here is a potentially ominous barometer of the country’s stability, an indication that the Shiite majority may have decided it is time, once more, to fight back against the Sunnis.        
Even after the Sunni insurgency was tamed in 2007, there was less violence but no reconciliation, and Al Qaeda kept up bombings aimed at restarting a sectarian war. But the Shiites, who are in charge of the government and security forces, mostly refrained from a violent response. The Shiite prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, claimed to be a leader of all Iraqis, burnishing his nationalist credentials by taking on the Shiite militias in several military operations.        
But now that calculus is changing: the militias, some of which answer to Iran, are re-emerging to protect their sect, believing that the security forces are unable to do so.

In the days when the twin towers were just two tall office buildings struggling to find tenants, long before the Sept. 11 attacks gave “World Trade Center” an unshakable emotional resonance, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey sold the rights to that three-word name to a nonprofit organization led by a former Port Authority executive. The price was reported to be $10.        


The arrangement received almost no attention until last week. But now it has prompted Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York to ask for an investigation by the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, with Mr. Cuomo saying that the former Port Authority official, Guy F. Tozzoli, “received exorbitant annual compensation” from the nonprofit World Trade Centers Association. Mr. Tozzoli, who oversaw the design and construction of the World Trade Center in the 1960s and ’70s and watched as the twin towers collapsed on Sept. 11, 2001, was paid $575,156 in 2010 and $626,573 in 2011, his last year as president, according to the association’s tax documents for those years.        
The documents said he worked an hour a week in 2011, on average, compared with 40 hours a week in 2010. One page in the filing for 2011 characterizes his compensation that year as “severance.”        
Mr. Tozzoli, who died in February at age 90, served as the association’s volunteer leader from 1970 until he retired from the Port Authority in 1987, and became the association’s president. Within the Port Authority, he was an influential figure who was credited with bringing the architect Minoru Yamasaki to the project and with suggesting that dirt and debris from the trade center excavation be used as landfill for what became Battery Park City.        
The association says its mission is to extend the World Trade Center brand. It has members in 330 cities, from Antwerp to Abu Dhabi. They pay the association thousands of dollars every year so they can use the words “World Trade Center” in their names, and the association has strict “brand guidelines” that they are supposed to follow, down to the logo and colors for items like letterheads and business cards.        
But in a letter to Mr. Schneiderman, the governor accused Mr. Tozzoli of securing “the exclusive rights to use the ‘World Trade Center’ name without obtaining the approval of the Port Authority’s board or executive director” in 1986, months before his departure from the agency for the association.        
The governor also said that the association registered additional trademarks for the “sole benefit” of the association “rather than the Port Authority.”        
“Using the millions of dollars in annual revenue from licensing fees paid by companies around the globe for the use of the World Trade Center brand, Mr. Tozzoli received exorbitant annual compensation” from the association, Mr. Cuomo said.        
He raised the possibility of using a state law to force Mr. Tozzoli’s heirs to pay back some of the money.        
On Wednesday, employees at the association said that no one was available to comment. They said Mr. Tozzoli’s successor as chief executive, Eric R. Dahl, was the only person at the association who could speak to a reporter, but he was on a flight back from China.        
The executive director of the Port Authority, Patrick J. Foye, called the naming rights transaction “shameful” and promised to cooperate with any investigations.        
A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman said that his review was still in a preliminary stage and that it was too early to say whether the allegations were true.        
The governor said in his letter that Mr. Tozzoli had secured the rights to the “World Trade Center” name for the association in 1986. The Port Authority’s executive director at the time, Stephen Berger, said he only recently learned of the arrangement, the subject of articles last week in The Record of Hackensack, N.J.        
“I did not sign that contract,” Mr. Berger said on Wednesday, explaining that some contracts could be executed by department heads at the agency and some by him, while some required approval by the authority’s board. “I have no idea where in the hierarchy of contractual authority this landed, and I could not opine on it” after so many years, he said.        
The association was discussed at least once at a Port Authority board meeting. The minutes for the session on April 26, 2001, said that in 1986, the Port Authority “transferred” to the association “ownership of certain registered service marks pertaining to the World Trade Center name.”        
The association’s tax filings indicate that most of its money comes from memberships — $3.3 million in 2011. It ended that year with $14.2 million in net assets; it spent $483,573 on conferences, conventions and meetings. The association’s annual report for 2011, the most recent year available, said its foundation had given $46,767 to the Japanese Red Cross after the magnitude 8.9 earthquake that struck northern Japan and the tsunami that followed.

EAST LAKE, Ga. — Gary Woodland’s length off the tee is impressive, but his short drives when he is home in Florida perhaps go further toward explaining his fast-track journey in golf. He gets around in a white Bentley Flying Spur, a car so luxurious it is akin to steering a cloud, which is not as comfortable as it sounds for the grounded Woodland.        


Presented with the opportunity to purchase the car for roughly the same price as a less showy four-door sedan, Woodland decided, why not?        
“Sometimes it’s good to step outside your box, and the Bentley’s definitely outside my box, ” Woodland said, laughing. “My buddies back home in Kansas tell me I better never bring it home. I don’t know how long I’ll keep it. I’ll have it for a little bit and then I’ll replace it with something more up my alley.”        
On the road to success, Woodland has repeatedly veered outside his comfort zone. He gave up baseball for basketball and basketball for golf. He left the cocoon of his birthplace, Topeka, Kan., for the big city of Dallas, and then for the tourist sprawl of Orlando. He bought the Bentley and, more recently, decided to go exploring inside his head.        
Some high-performance athletes never look under the hood, not wanting to know what makes them purr or sputter. Woodland, who was drawn to sports from the time he was old enough to swing a club or bat, has twice turned to mental coaches to help him reconcile his outer-directed personality with natural athletic gifts and inner drive.        
Woodland’s background is in team sports, and he speaks wistfully of the fellowship that develops when a team works toward a common goal. Golf can be the loneliest of individual sports, a cage wrestling match between the player and the course.        
To recreate the camaraderie Woodland enjoyed as a youth, he has recruited a team that is working toward maximizing his success. It includes a swing coach, Claude Harmon; a short-game coach, Pat Goss; his agent, Mark Steinberg; a physical therapist, Marc Wahl; and his girlfriend, Gabby Granado. Last month, Steinberg was instrumental in drafting a new member: Julie Elion, the founder of the Washington-based Center for Athletic Performance Enhancement.        
Last month, while the world’s top golfers were at the Bridgestone Invitational, Woodland was preparing for the concurrent Reno-Tahoe Open. Steinberg told Woodland he appeared to be heaping too much pressure on himself. For whatever reason, Steinberg added, Woodland was repeating the same mental mistakes. Woodland did not argue.        
“I was trying to get everything back with one swing,” he said, “and you just can’t do that.”        
Steinberg recommended that Woodland talk to Elion, who works with several tour players, including a few who have won majors. Woodland spoke with Elion for the first time on the eve of the Reno-Tahoe tournament. Four days later, he won for the first time on tour since his maiden victory in 2011, and he jumped from 116th to 54th in the FedEx Cup standings. It was Woodland’s first top-10 finish of the year. He followed it with a tie for second in the Barclays, the first FedEx Cup playoff event, three weeks later. He is back in this week’s Tour Championship after a one-year hiatus.        
Elion has given him two basic thoughts to replace all the clutter in his mind. The first is stop hating the last shot and love the next shot. The other is that he does not need to hit every shot perfectly because he possesses the all-around game to erase mistakes that are part of any round.        
Woodland, ranked 90th but No. 17 in the FedEx standings this week, also receives strong support from his family and friends back home. Joey Devine, a childhood friend who also grew up in Topeka, walked with him during his Tuesday practice round, and his parents, Dan and Linda, will follow him for all 72 holes of the no-cut competition.        
“Coming from where I come in Kansas, you always try to please other people,” Woodland said. “I still like to please other people, but Julie’s trying to get me to make sure I take care of my stuff, too.”        
The first time Woodland sought psychological aid, it was to help him negotiate a devastating loss. When he was 16, his mentor, Scott Duermeier, who had coached Woodland in basketball, unexpectedly died. Duermeier was 29 — Woodland’s age now.        
“It was a hard, hard deal,” Woodland said. “He was kind of like a role model, baby sitter. He coached me, and I played golf with him.”        
Woodland was on his high school basketball team, and the court became his sanctuary.        
“Basketball was my getaway,” he said. “It was outside of basketball that I really struggled with it.”

EAST LAKE, Ga. — The prize in sports that routinely logs the most miles is hockey’s Stanley Cup. This off-season, the trophy has touched down in more than two dozen countries.        


The green jacket that is awarded to each Masters champion might be running second this year among sports’ travel-weary tokens. Adam Scott, Australian by birth and Swiss by passport, confided Wednesday that he regularly hauls his size 40-regular jacket to tournament locales.        
For him, it is living out of a suitcase; for the coat, it is living in one.        
“It’s here with me,” Scott said on the eve of the Tour Championship. “It comes pretty much anywhere. I wear it in my hotel room all the time just by myself.”        
In a banner year chock-full of scrapbook moments, Scott said nothing had delighted him more than “getting a kick out of people seeing the green jacket.”        
MAN IN THE MIDDLE Last year, after the final event before the Tour Championship, Brandt Snedeker thought that he ranked sixth in the point standings, one rung below a significant line of demarcation. Each of the first five is assured of collecting the $10 million bonus and the FedEx Cup title — but no jacket of any hue — by winning the tournament.        
On the way to Atlanta, Snedeker learned from Keegan Bradley that he was fifth. Emboldened, Snedeker triumphed at East Lake Golf Club and accepted the check brimming with zeros.        
The recalibration “gave me a sense of relief, knowing I controlled my own destiny,” Snedeker said. “I didn’t have to listen to see how every scenario played out, like I do this week.”        
Fast forward to three days ago. Matt Kuchar believed he held sixth place until a discussion among colleagues prompted him to borrow a smartphone for confirmation. Kuchar summoned the standings and learned he had been bumped down only one spot, to fifth.        
The phone’s owner: Bradley.        
“So I’m hoping there’s some sort of fate there,” Kuchar said, “with Keegan being the middleman.”        
THE UNBLINKING EYE If the PGA Tour policy board solicits input from players on the contentious practice of levying stroke penalties after a round is completed when television viewers alert rules officials to legitimate infractions that went unnoticed, Tiger Woods would be willing to offer a proposal.        
“There needs to be a time limit, and I think there needs to be a discussion of where is that time limit,” said Woods, who has been penalized twice this season.        
Woods insinuated that his attraction to TV cameras carried an unjust burden.        
“I get it from the first time I step on the range on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday all the way through, and virtually every shot is on something,” he said.        
“Most players don’t get it until they’re on the leader groups Saturday and Sunday.”        
OLD DRIVER, NEW DRIVER At first viewing, the video from last Sunday’s BMW Championship appears to show Henrik Stenson clobbering an unwelcome creature into submission on the 18th hole.        
Rather, Stenson was taking out his frustration over errant tee shots on the driver. He pounded the club, causing its head to snap off and leaving him in need of a replacement.        
“For whatever reason,” he said, deadpan, “I’ve kind of had to get into testing a new driver.”        
Initial impressions are encouraging. Stenson welcomes the reduced ball spin that it generates, even though its predecessor was sufficient to deliver him to the tournament second in points.        
“So I think it could be a good switch,” he said.        
Stenson believes the remains of the decapitated club might have been converted into a desk penholder.        
THE LEARNING CURVE The youngest player in the FedEx Cup field says discipline and patience have helped him to a remarkable rookie season.        
Jordan Spieth, 20, said that reining in his bulldog approach while gripping a club has been integral to a year garnished by one victory and eight top-10 finishes.        
“The only time I’ve gotten in trouble this year is when I tried to do too much,” he said.        
“My 16-year-old self would be pretty upset at some of the decisions I’ve made that have actually paid off.”        
Exercising restraint has also come in handy while out of his golf shoes, especially with the spoils available to players, like plentiful food in the clubhouse.        
“Trying to learn how to control myself with all the buffets, that’s definitely been a change,” said Spieth, whose trim frame suggests he has been successful.        
FORECAST: RAIN With this year on pace to become metro Atlanta’s wettest on record, it was inevitable that rain would creep into the tournament forecast. There is a 40 percent chance that golfers and the gallery will be wearing rain gear during the third round Saturday, with the probability growing to 70 percent Sunday.

The 13-year-old boy was fatally shot a year ago during an encounter between rival groups of teenagers in Brownsville, Brooklyn. But the killing of Ronald Wallace had not been forgotten there: on a recent Saturday, his smiling face adorned small cards that hung from the necks of other young men who were marking the anniversary.        


Not far away, Sgt. George Tavares circled the neighborhood in an unmarked police car, and later, officers stood sentry on street corners, prepared for violence by a local gang, Addicted to Cash, known on the streets as A.T.C. “Our intelligence suggests there could be a retaliation,” Sergeant Tavares said.        
The show of police force in Brownsville reflects a broad shift in the New York Police Department’s strategy for combating gun violence. The stop-and-frisk tactic, once the linchpin of the police’s efforts to get guns off the streets, is in a steep decline; it has been rejected by the City Council, a federal judge and, most recently, the Democratic voters who supported the mayoral candidacy of Bill de Blasio, an outspoken critic of the tactic.        
In its place, the department has focused on those responsible for much of the city’s violent crime: youth gangs, known as crews or sets. And while the new strategy has raised some objections, including privacy concerns, it has also garnered support from the stop-and-frisk tactic’s greatest critics.        
As crime in New York continues to decline, violence by youth gangs has grown more pronounced: 30 percent of all shootings in recent years were related to crews, the department found.        
Compared with gangs like the Bloods or the Crips, crews are more informal groups of teenagers and young men who are organized geographically, around a housing project, a block or a single building. Members are rarely involved in criminal enterprises beyond robberies or marijuana dealing, and there is frequently no initiation. Their conflicts, the police said, are mostly based on rivalries over reputation and turf.        
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly says the effort, called Operation Crew Cut, has helped drive murders down to new lows over the last year. Citywide, the police recorded 774 shootings through Sept. 8, down from 1,029 over the same period last year. In one of the most violent precincts, the 75th Precinct in East New York, shootings so far this year are down 30 percent.        
“If I had to point to one reason why the murders and the shootings are down, it is this program,” Mr. Kelly said. “And I can tell you that there is a lot of positive feedback from cops.”        
The strategy seeks to exploit the online postings of suspected members and their digital connections to build criminal conspiracy cases against whole groups that might otherwise take years of painstaking undercover work to penetrate. Facebook, officers like to say now, is the most reliable informer.        
Operation Crew Cut melds intelligence gathered by officers on the street with online postings, allowing the department to track emerging conflicts in a neighborhood before they erupt into violence and, when shootings do occur, to build conspiracy cases against those responsible. But the scrutiny online has raised concern that idle chatter by teenagers might be misinterpreted by the police.        
“Once there was a fight in the classroom, it was just you and that person who had a fight; now on social media, it’s 500,000 people looking at this fight,” said Erica Ford, the founder of Life Camp, a nonprofit organization in Jamaica, Queens, that works to defuse conflicts among teenagers. “Why are you creating a unit to incriminate and criminalize what they’re doing and lock them up?”        
The police and prosecutors in New York have made no secret of their efforts, splashing arrays of arrest photos after big roundups in Brownsville and Bushwick in Brooklyn, and in East Harlem.        
Other cities, like Chicago, have sought to create dialogues with gangs, intervening in disputes and brokering cease-fires. Los Angeles has long made a practice of obtaining court orders to prohibit gang members from appearing together in public, drawing criticism from civil liberties advocates who say that it criminalizes ordinary behavior. More recently, the police there have been working with former members to tamp down conflicts.

TORONTO — If the Yankees had lost to Toronto on Wednesday, they would not have been eliminated from the race for a postseason berth. It certainly would have felt that way, though.        


So when the Yankees rallied for four runs in the eighth inning, with the former Blue Jay Vernon Wells striking the key blow, and held on for a nerve-rattling 4-3 victory, they felt their season had been saved.        
“For now, yeah,” Wells said.        
Although there was still much work to be done, the Yankees’ agonizing four-game losing streak was over, and an energetic buzz surrounded them after the game.        
In the clubhouse, Brendan Ryan, who led off the eighth with a double, held up his iPhone so he and Alfonso Soriano could watch the ninth inning of Baltimore’s victory over Boston, a game that had a bearing on the Yankees’ fortunes. Andy Pettitte laughed as he gathered teammates to take stock of Alex Rodriguez’s preppy outfit, and all around, the players and the coaches breathed a sigh of relief.        
The Yankees were still two and a half games out of the second wild-card spot — with 10 to play — but at least they were not on the cusp of being swept by the last-place Blue Jays.        
“It was a huge win for us,” Mariano Rivera said. “A huge win.”        
Rivera played a key role for the Yankees, recording a four-out save after he took over for David Robertson in the middle of an at-bat in the eighth.        
Robertson, protecting a one-run lead, had gotten the first two outs of the inning, but the speedy Rajai Davis singled.        
The Yankees tried a pitchout against Brett Lawrie to get Davis at second, and negate the need to bring in Rivera early, but Davis still beat the throw. Yankees Manager Joe Girardi walked out of the dugout, waved his hands to get the umpire’s attention and then tapped his right arm for Rivera. Even with Lawrie ahead, 1-0, in the count, it was not a difficult decision.        
“I don’t think there’s any arguing who the best closer of all time is,” Girardi said. “And that’s who I went with.”        
Rivera got Lawrie to ground out, but things grew more complicated in the ninth.        
The Blue Jays started the inning with two singles. Munenori Kawasaki bunted, but first baseman Lyle Overbay charged the ball and threw out the runner at third for the first out. The runners advanced when Ryan Goins grounded out to Robinson Cano. A solid single probably would have given Toronto the game and crushed the Yankees’ hopes for good, but Rivera struck out J. P. Arencibia to end the game.        
“We have to be ready for any situation,” said Rivera, who earned his 44th save.        
The Yankees’ 16-inning scoring drought, which began with Tuesday’s demoralizing shutout loss, finally ended in the eighth. Ryan doubled off starter J. A. Happ, who was replaced by the left-hander Aaron Loup. Curtis Granderson then singled to put runners at first and third with nobody out.        
Blue Jays Manager John Gibbons summoned Steve Delabar to face Rodriguez, and Delabar struck him out. But Cano singled over the head of Goins at second base, and Ryan scored with the Yankees’ first run since the ninth inning of Sunday’s loss to the Red Sox. Granderson scored again for the Yankees — and cut their deficit to 3-2 — when Soriano doubled off the wall in right field.        
It was up to Wells. He doubled to the corner in left field, Cano and Soriano scored, and the Yankees finally took a lead.        
Asked if he was surprised to be allowed to hit in that situation, Wells paused for a moment, smiled and said, “I was just happy to have the opportunity.”        
Even Soriano, who said after Tuesday night’s loss that the Yankees did not have the proper energy, was pleased. Still, he demanded more.        
“That was a very important game, and through the seventh inning we didn’t do nothing,” he said. “Now, tomorrow, we have to score early and take some pressure off the pitchers.”        
Girardi said earlier Wednesday that the game could be characterized as a must-win, a declaration that did not end with the long-awaited victory.        
“We still have a long way to go,” he said, “but there’s a better feeling in here than we’ve had in a while.”        
INSIDE PITCH        
Boone Logan, who threw about 30 pitches in the bullpen, said that he could still feel some discomfort from the bone spur in his left elbow but that he had every intention of pitching through it, starting Friday.

Ken Norton, who had three memorable fights with Muhammad Ali, breaking Ali’s jaw in winning their first bout, then losing twice, and who went on to become the World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, died Wednesday in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, Nev. He was 70.        


His death was confirmed by his son Ken Jr., an assistant coach with the Seattle Seahawks of the N.F.L. and a pro linebacker for 13 seasons, The Associated Press said. Norton had been in poor health for several years after sustaining a series of strokes, The A.P. reported.        
Norton defeated Ali on a 12-round split decision in 1973 to capture the North American Boxing Federation heavyweight title. Norton was an exceptionally muscular 6 feet 2 inches and 220 pounds, but he was a decided underdog in the first Ali fight.        
“Ali thought it would be an easy fight,” Norton’s former manager, Gene Kilroy, was quoted by The A.P. as saying. “But Norton was unorthodox. Instead of jabbing from above like most fighters, he would put his hand down and jab up at Ali.”        
Kilroy said that after the fight, Norton visited Ali at the hospital where he was getting his broken jaw wired, and Ali told him he never wanted to fight him again.        
But the second bout in their trilogy came six months later, when Ali rallied to win a narrow split decision. In their final bout, Ali retained his World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association titles when he defeated Norton on a decision that was unanimous but booed by many in the crowd of more than 30,000 at Yankee Stadium in September 1976.        
“I was never the same fighter after that,” Norton told Red Smith of The New York Times in October 1979. “I never trained so hard again, never could put the same feeling into it. I was at my best that night, in the best shape I ever was.”        
In 1977, Norton knocked out the previously unbeaten Duane Bobick in the first round and defeated Jimmy Young in a 15-round split decision in a W.B.C. title elimination series. He became the mandatory challenger for the winner of the coming fight between Ali and Leon Spinks. Spinks defeated Ali for the championship but shunned Norton for his first defense in favor of a rematch with Ali. The W.B.C. stripped Spinks of the title and awarded it to Norton.        
Norton made his first defense of the W.B.C. title in 1978 against Larry Holmes and lost by a 15-round split decision in one of boxing’s most exciting fights.        
Kenneth Howard Norton was born Aug. 9, 1943, in Jacksonville, Ill., and starred in high school football, basketball and track. He attended Northeast Missouri State University (now Truman State University) on a football scholarship but was hampered by a shoulder injury in his first two seasons and enlisted in the Marine Corps. Norton started boxing while he was in the Marines, compiling an amateur record of 24-2 and winning the All-Marine Heavyweight Championship three times.        
He turned pro in 1967 and won 16 straight bouts before being knocked out by Jose Luis Garcia. Soon afterward, he read Napoleon Hill’s motivational book “Think and Grow Rich.”        
“I must have read that book 100 times while in training, and I became a stronger person for it,” the Web site BoxRec.com quoted him as saying. He said he believed in the book’s philosophy that a person could do the unexpected if he put his mind to it.        
“So I train for my fights mentally as well as physically,” he said. “One thing I do is only watch films of the fights in which I’ve done well or in which my opponent has done poorly.”        
Norton fought the undefeated George Foreman for the W.B.C. and W.B.A. heavyweight championships in 1974 and was knocked out in the second round. He stopped Jerry Quarry in five rounds in 1975 to regain the N.A.B.F. crown. In his next fight, Norton avenged his 1970 loss to Garcia with a fifth-round knockout.        
After retiring for a time, Norton returned in 1980 and defeated the previously unbeaten Tex Cobb on a decision. The next year, Gerry Cooney, ranked No. 1 by the W.B.A. and the W.B.C., knocked Norton out in the first round in what became his final fight. Norton won 42 fights (33 by knockout), lost seven times and fought one draw.        
Norton acted in several movies, most notably “Mandingo” (1975), in which he played the slave Mede, who is trained to fight by his owner.        
Ken Norton Jr. played linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys from 1988 to 1993 and for the San Francisco 49ers from 1994 to 2000. He was a three-time Pro Bowl player with the 49ers.        
In addition to Ken Jr., Norton’s survivors include his wife, Rose Conant; two other sons, Keith and Kenny John; and a daughter, Kenisha.

In hindsight, it may seem clear that Aaron Alexis, who went on a shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, posed a threat long before the attack, but most mental health experts say that barring the rare few who declare their intentions, it can be extremely difficult to pick out people who are likely to commit murder.        


“Couldn’t someone have predicted this and intervened and saved all these lives?” said Jeffrey W. Swanson, a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University. “I get asked this a lot when there’s a horrible mass shooting and indications that the perpetrator had a mental health problem. I can tell you the common characteristics of people who engage in mass shootings: It’s a picture of troubled, isolated young men that matches the picture of tens of thousands of other young men who will never do this.”        
Just last month, Mr. Alexis told the police in Rhode Island that he was hearing voices and was being followed by people who were bombarding him with vibrations. Three violent incidents in the past decade led to run-ins with the police.        
For its part, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it did not have anywhere near enough clues to ring alarm bells. Mr. Alexis, 34, visited the emergency room at the V.A. Medical Center in Providence, R.I., on Aug. 23, “complaining of insomnia,” the agency said in a statement Wednesday. “After a medical examination, he was given a small amount of medication to help him sleep and was instructed to follow up with a primary care provider,” the statement said.        
On Aug. 28, Mr. Alexis sought a medication refill at the emergency room of the V.A. Medical Center in Washington. There, he “attributed his insomnia to his work schedule,” the agency said in its statement. “He was given a small refill and was instructed to follow up with a primary care provider. On both occasions, Mr. Alexis was alert and oriented, and was asked by V.A. doctors if he was struggling with anxiety or depression, or had thoughts about harming himself or others, which he denied.”        
According to its records, the agency said, Mr. Alexis “never sought an appointment from a mental health specialist, and had previously either canceled or failed to show up for primary care appointments and claims evaluations examinations he had scheduled at V.A. Medical Centers.”        
Even if he had kept the appointments, it is hard to say if he would have given doctors enough reasons to intervene. Research shows that psychiatrists and psychologists do not do well at predicting violence. Dr. Swanson described a study in which two groups of psychiatrists were asked to read the records of patients treated for mental health problems. One group was told that the patients had committed murders or suicides, and the doctors were asked to comb over the records and look for warning signs or red flags that might have tipped off a therapist to the imminent threat.        
A second group read the same records and was also asked to look for warning signs, but was not told about murders or suicides.        
The group that knew things had ended badly was more likely to find danger signs in the records. The second group, by and large, did not see much out of the ordinary.        
Still other studies, Dr. Swanson said, have found that psychiatrists are good at predicting which patients will not commit acts of violence, but poor at recognizing those who will.        
“I wish I had better news,” Dr. Swanson said.        
Rachel Yehuda, a professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who does research on post-traumatic stress disorder, said that tragedies might be averted if the police could immediately call in a mental health team when they encountered people like Mr. Alexis who claim to be hearing voices.        
“Wouldn’t it be great if there was a local outreach team that the police could call?” Dr. Yehuda said.  “We know how to send an ambulance, but maybe we should have the equivalent of a mental health ambulance.”          
Dr. Yehuda agreed that predicting violence is a tough call, but she said that certain symptoms were a warning sign, including two that Mr. Alexis apparently exhibited: hearing voices and displaying uncontrollable anger. The idea that Mr. Alexis had a blackout caused by anger was especially troubling, Dr. Yehuda said.

Delaware announced on Wednesday a new effort to encourage high-achieving low-income students to apply to top colleges, saying it would send application fee waivers and other information to every such high school senior in the state.        


The program — a collaboration between Gov. Jack Markell, a Democrat, and the College Board, which administers the SAT — is a response to recent research showing that most poor students with high grades do not apply to any top colleges. Instead, many attend colleges with fewer resources and fail to graduate, at a time when the wage gap between college graduates and everyone else is near a record high.        
The pattern contributes to income inequality and holds down social mobility, economists say.        
In a separate move Wednesday, also in response to the recent research, Wellesley College unveiled a calculator designed to show poor and middle-class students that they would pay only a small fraction of the published tuition if they attended the college. Similar calculators already exist, but Wellesley’s may be the simplest, requiring many fewer steps.        
Delaware is already one of three states — Idaho and Maine are the others — that pays for all high school juniors to take the SAT, according to the College Board. Delaware began doing so in 2010-11, in reaction to the Obama administration’s Race to the Top education program.        
Under the new effort, paid for by the College Board, high-achieving low-income students will also receive a packet of information on selective colleges, as well as waivers for the application fee. The information includes details on admission and financial aid policies, as well as on the variation in graduation rates at different colleges.        
In a recent experiment by Caroline M. Hoxby of Stanford and Sarah E. Turner of the University of Virginia, similar packets increased the number of students who applied to top colleges.        
The Delaware packets will also include a letter from 10 elite colleges — the members of the Ivy League, as well as M.I.T. and Stanford — saying that the students are candidates for admission. The governor and the state’s education secretary will add their own letters, congratulating the students on their success.        
Because Delaware is a small state, with only about 9,000 high school seniors, the new program applies to relatively few students: about 80 who are candidates for admission to elite colleges, and an additional 300 with grades and test scores high enough to be admitted to other four-year colleges. But officials say they hope the model encourages larger states to take similar steps.        
“Kids have earned opportunities they do not take,” David Coleman, the president of the College Board, said in an interview. “It’s our mission to fix that.”        
One unresolved question is how colleges will respond if they begin receiving many more applications from low-income students who are qualified for admission. A recent study, by Dr. Hoxby and Christopher Avery of Harvard, found that only 34 percent of high-achieving high school seniors in the bottom fourth of the income distribution attended any of the country’s 238 most selective colleges. Many who do not apply live in smaller metropolitan areas.        
If more such students were to apply, colleges could face new pressures on their financial aid budgets. An array of college administrators have said they are eager to recruit more low-income students, even though they have largely failed to do so in recent years.        
Wellesley, a women’s college outside Boston whose alumnae include Hillary Rodham Clinton, enrolls a larger percentage of lower-income students than most elite colleges. Still, officials there said that many high school students remained confused about how much it would cost for them to attend and declined to apply.        
The new calculator — which asks, anonymously, for six pieces of financial information, including income and home value — will help, the officials said.        
“The conversation that takes place around college costs is largely misguided,” said Phillip B. Levine, a professor of economics at the college, who developed the calculator. “People focus only on the sticker price.”        
The published cost of a year at Wellesley, including tuition, room and board, and fees, is $57,042. But about 60 percent of students receive financial aid.        
A typical married couple earning $85,000 a year who have no other students in college would pay about $12,000 to send a child to Wellesley. A typical couple earning $50,000 would pay about $4,000.        
The calculator somewhat understates the amount that families pay by ignoring the money that students themselves pay, on top of what their parents pay. Most students at Wellesley who receive financial aid pay about $5,000 a year, through a combination of a loan and wages from a campus job.

GREENBURGH, N.Y. — As the Rangers headed to Banff, Alberta, to continue their training camp, Coach Alain Vigneault was especially enthusiastic about the trip.        


Heading into his first season behind the Rangers’ bench, Vigneault, who coached the Vancouver Canucks for the last seven seasons, said Wednesday that he welcomed the opportunity to become fully acquainted with all the elements of the organization.        
“For me, this is an ideal scenario,” said Vigneault, whose team will play four preseason games in five nights next week.        
“The trip gives me a chance to spend quality time with everyone from my coaching staff to Glen to players away from the rink,” he added, referring to General Manager Glen Sather. “This is a real positive for all of us.”        
The trip also gives Vigneault time to sort out which of his 39 players will be Rangers when the team opens the season at Phoenix on Oct. 3.        
Center Derek Stepan, the Rangers’ leading scorer last season, remains absent because of a contract stalemate. The team’s captain, Ryan Callahan, and his fellow forward Carl Hagelin are still recovering from off-season shoulder operations, and forwards Brad Richards and Chris Kreider are continuing to work on their games after having difficult seasons in 2012-13.        
“I will continue to play a lot of people and get a read of them,” Vigneault said.        
In the mix are the young forwards Oscar Lindberg, Danny Kristo and Jesper Fast and goaltender Cam Talbot, who impressed Vigneault while playing parts of preseason games this week against the Devils and Philadelphia. Talbot, 26, is vying with the veteran Martin Biron to be Henrik Lundqvist’s backup. “He made a big save last night,” Vigneault said, referring to Talbot’s stop on the Flyers’ Jakob Voracek to preserve a 3-2 win. Vigneault added, “He’s progressed quite a bit.”        
Talbot, who played 55 games last season for the Connecticut Whale of the American Hockey League, said: “It’s a huge opportunity even if I don’t crack the backup role. Watching their work ethic and how hard they work every day is important for me. Hopefully that pushes me in the future.”        
As for Stepan, who had 18 goals and 26 assists in the lockout-shortened, 48-game season, Vigneault said: “I’m functioning as if he’s not here. Lots of guys are pushing. We’ll have to sort this out as we move forward. I like the way Oscar is skating. And I really like Kristo. Ryan is not here, Haggie is not here, and Step’s not here. I’m planning for the guys that are.”        
Stepan, 23, is a restricted free agent without arbitration rights. The Rangers have less than $3 million in salary-cap space and will most likely seek a bridge deal at about $2.5 million per year for Stepan, their second-round draft pick out of Wisconsin in 2008, whose three-year, entry-level contract ended after last season.        
Stepan, a versatile center, has not missed a regular-season or playoff game in three seasons with the Rangers. He often skates on the team’s top line and on the power play, and he also kills penalties.        
Vigneault said he was watching the progress of Kreider, 22, who made a splash with five goals in the 2012 playoffs but shuttled between the Rangers and their affiliate in Hartford last season. He played only 23 games with the Rangers, scoring two goals.        
“He’s got size and speed,” Vigneault said. “I like a lot of the things Chris is doing. That can work in front of the net on the power play. He’s going to get a real good look.”        
SLAP SHOTS        
The Rangers will visit Calgary (Monday), Edmonton (Tuesday) and Vancouver (Sept. 26) and play the Los Angeles Kings in Las Vegas on Sept. 27. ... The Rangers assigned forwards Ryan Bourque, Josh Nicholls, Shawn O’Donnell and Michael St. Croix, as well as defenseman Brendon Nash, to Hartford. ... Goaltender Johan Hedberg, 40, who was Martin Brodeur’s backup with the Devils for the last three seasons, was released from his tryout agreement.

WASHINGTON — Despite deep divisions that have kept Congress from passing new gun safety laws for almost two decades, there is one aspect of gun control on which many Democrats, Republicans and even the National Rifle Association agree: the need to give mental health providers better resources to treat dangerous people and prevent them from buying weapons.        


Yet efforts to improve the country’s fraying mental health system to help prevent mass shootings have stalled on Capitol Hill, tied up in the broader fight over expanded background checks and limits on weapons sales.        
Now the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard by a man who authorities say showed telltale signs of psychosis is spurring a push to move ahead with bipartisan mental health policy changes. The new debate over gun control is beginning to turn not on weapons or ammunition, but on the question of whether to spend more money on treating and preventing mental illness.        
Proponents again face a steep uphill push, but they see an opening even if it remains unclear whether any changes under consideration could have headed off the latest attack, in which the authorities say Aaron Alexis, a former Navy reservist, bought the shotgun he used in Virginia.        
“Given the clear connection between recent mass shootings and mental illness, the Senate should not delay bipartisan legislation that would help address this issue,” Senators Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, and Mark Begich, Democrat of Alaska, wrote Wednesday in a joint statement to the Senate leadership. The legislation they are pushing, which was held up when a more sweeping gun measure was defeated earlier this year, would establish programs to train teachers to recognize the signs of mental illness and how to defuse potentially violent situations.        
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader and a strong proponent of the failed Senate plan to expand the federal background check system, is resisting any move to advance the mental health provisions, fearing that it would be used as a fig leaf by those who oppose expanded checks while closing the door to weapons restrictions in the future. Both Ms. Ayotte and Mr. Begich opposed the gun control bill that failed in April.        
Some gun rights advocates fear the opposite: that opening discussion on mental health could be a back door to a flood of new federal gun laws.        
But several senators, like Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who has pushed for tougher gun laws since last year’s elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., see mental health policy as a way forward.        
“Mental health is really the key to unlocking this issue,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “I’ve become more and more convinced that we should establish the mental health issue as our common ground.”        
But while state lawmakers have taken steps in recent years to make buying weapons harder for certain people showing signs of mental illness in places including New York, Connecticut and Florida, where the legislation won the blessing of the National Rifle Association, there is not yet serious discussion in Congress of doing so.        
“If you’re having auditory hallucinations, that’s a sign of schizophrenia,” said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, referring to reports that Mr. Alexis suffered from delusions. Though someone like that should not have a gun, Mr. Coburn said, he expressed little faith that Congress could come together to write a law to fix that.        
“It’s all politics,” he said. The senator helped lead negotiations on a background check proposal that fell apart earlier this year.        
Mr. Alexis appears to be only the latest gunman whose mental health issues did not reach the level at which he would have been prohibited from buying a firearm under federal law. And it is unknowable whether even the most drastic improvements to the nation’s mental health system would have caught and treated the symptoms of someone like Mr. Alexis. The same can also be said for laws that restrict gun ownership for people with histories of mental illness.        
The Veterans Affairs Department said Wednesday that on the two times Mr. Alexis visited an emergency room in August, he seemed alert and denied being depressed or thinking of harming himself.

In 2002, a novel thought to be the first written by an African-American woman became a best seller, praised for its dramatic depiction of Southern life in the mid-1850s through the observant eyes of a refined and literate house servant.        


But one part of the story remained a tantalizing secret: the author’s identity.        
That literary mystery may have been solved by a professor of English in South Carolina, who said this week that after years of research, he has discovered the novelist’s name: Hannah Bond, a slave on a North Carolina plantation owned by John Hill Wheeler, is the actual writer of “The Bondwoman’s Narrative,” the book signed by Hannah Crafts.        
Beyond simply identifying the author, the professor’s research offers insight into one of the central mysteries of the novel, believed to be semi-autobiographical: how a house slave with limited access to education and books was heavily influenced by the great literature of her time, like “Bleak House” and “Jane Eyre,” and how she managed to pull off a daring escape from servitude, disguised as a man.        
The professor, Gregg Hecimovich, the chairman of the English department at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C., has uncovered previously unknown details about Bond’s life that have shed light on how the novel was possibly written. The heavy influences of Dickens, for instance, particularly from “Bleak House,” can be explained by Bond’s onetime servitude on a plantation that routinely kept boarders from a nearby girls’ school; the curriculum there required the girls to recite passages of “Bleak House” from memory. Bond, secretly forming her own novel, could have listened while they studied, or spirited away a copy to read.        
The research also shows that Bond may have been given a man’s suit by a member of the Wheeler family who was sympathetic to her desire to flee.        
Professor Hecimovich, 44, said that he has verified the writer’s identity through wills, diaries, handwritten almanacs and public records. He intends to publish his full findings in a book, tentatively titled “The Life and Times of Hannah Crafts.”        
His work has been reviewed by several scholars who vouch for its authenticity, including Henry Louis Gates Jr., one of the nation’s pre-eminent scholars of African-American history. Professor Gates bought the obscure manuscript at auction in 2001.        
“Words cannot express how meaningful this is to African-American literary studies,” he said in an interview. “It revolutionizes our understanding of the canon of black women’s literature.”        
Professor Gates said that Professor Hecimovich’s discovery answers one of the large and lingering questions that has vexed him for more than a decade about the author of the book.        
Hollis Robbins, the chairwoman of the department of humanities at the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University, called it a “tremendous” finding. “I’m totally convinced,” she said, “to the extent that anything historical can be documented without an iPhone picture of her writing the novel.”        
The book, whose language borrows from 19th-century Gothic novels, traces the story of its narrator, who endures life as a slave on a North Carolina plantation and, aided by her light complexion, successfully escapes to the North.        
That tale closely mirrors the story of Bond. Enslaved on a plantation in Murfreesboro, N.C., Bond is believed to have been a self-educated woman who worked as a maid to the mistress of the house, Ellen Wheeler, assisting her with errands and personal duties, like styling her hair.        
But around 1857, Bond disguised herself as a boy and escaped, fleeing first to upstate New York and then to New Jersey, where she eventually married and found work as a schoolteacher.        
The novel, Professor Hecimovich believes, had its beginnings in the Wheeler home, where Bond could have had access to the family’s library and its writing materials, including a distinctive paper that was used to connect the novel to the Wheelers.

Bill de Blasio’s path to the Democratic nomination for mayor was built in large part around his theme that New York has become a tale of two cities. New data being released on Thursday by the Census Bureau lend support to that argument, showing that even as the recession has ended, the city’s poverty rate continues to inch up and the gap between the rich and poor remains stubbornly large.        


“It’s not good news,” said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society, a research and advocacy group. “We’re three years into a recovery and the poverty rate is creeping upward. I don’t think this has to mean an all-out call for class warfare, but it’s a serious threat to the viability of the city of New York.        
“This is going to drag us all down.”        
Mr. de Blasio, who has attracted populist support with his message of economic inequality, said the latest census data reinforced the need for the next mayor to alter course. “I wish it didn’t,” he said.        
His Republican opponent, Joseph J. Lhota, has accused Mr. de Blasio of promoting class warfare, but Mr. Lhota acknowledged on Wednesday that poverty remained a critical problem.        
“There is no question that people are suffering in this economy,” Mr. Lhota said. “The key to lifting people out of poverty is through the creation of career jobs and education.” He said he would focus on diversifying the economy and creating additional affordable housing “to ensure more people make it into the middle class.”        
The poverty rate rose to 21.2 percent in 2012, from 20.9 percent the year before, meaning that 1.7 million New Yorkers fell below the official federal poverty threshold. That increase was not statistically significant, but the rise from the 2010 rate of 20.1 percent was.        
Despite such a gloomy picture, Bloomberg administration officials said the city was faring better than others.        
“The national recession increased poverty rates across the country, but other major cities saw their poverty rates increase by more than what we have seen in New York City, largely because we’ve been a national leader in creating jobs and breaking the cycle of poverty,” Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services, said. “In 2012, the increase in poverty that resulted from the national recession leveled off, but there remains an enormous amount of work to do to connect those struggling to new jobs and opportunities.”        
Since 2000, she said, the city has gone to 13th highest from 6th highest among poverty rates for the 20 biggest cities.        
The census data did contain some other good news.        
In the city, median household income inched up to $50,895, from $50,657, after declining for three years from its recent high of $54,695 in 2008. And 6 of the nation’s 10 largest cities had higher poverty rates, although 4 recorded declines compared with 2011. On average, New York had a lower poverty rate, fewer people without health insurance and a higher median household income than other major metropolitan areas.        
A deeper look at the poverty rate showed that it varied widely and predictably. It was higher among black and Hispanic New Yorkers. Among children 17 and younger, 31 percent fell below the poverty line. So did 32 percent of families headed by a single mother, and 19 percent of New Yorkers ages 65 and over.        
Fourteen percent had no health insurance, including 4 percent of children under 18. Fifty percent of homeowners with mortgages and 54 percent of renters spent 30 percent or more of their income on housing. The share receiving food stamps rose to 21 percent, from 20.6 percent.        
Jilly Stephens, executive director of City Harvest, a food rescue organization, said, “The food insecure population of New York City remains immune from economic growth, and it is alarming that nearly two million New Yorkers could see their food stamp benefits cut in the coming weeks — which will make it even harder to put food on the table.” Ms. Stephens was referring to a battle in Congress over a farm bill, which some conservatives say must reduce spending on food stamps.        
Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, said some of the increase in food stamp recipients could be attributed to government policies, like shortening application forms and no longer requiring finger imaging. Still, he said, one million New Yorkers on Medicaid are not getting food stamps and “a large number would be eligible.”        
A yawning income gap seemed to show a city that has become stratified with wealth concentrated in a small percentage of the population.        
Citywide, the mean income of the lowest fifth was $8,993, while the highest fifth made $222,871 and the top 5 percent made $436,931 — about 49 times as much as those with the lowest income.        
Manhattan retained the dubious distinction of having the biggest income gap of any big county in the country. The mean income of the lowest fifth was $9,635, compared with $389,007 for the top fifth and $799,969 for the top 5 percent — more than an eightyfold difference between bottom and top.

HONG KONG — A company listed in Hong Kong that is caught up in a corruption investigation focused on China’s biggest state-owned oil conglomerate said on Thursday that Chinese investigators had questioned it about projects, seized documents and frozen some bank accounts.         
The company, Wison Engineering Services, disclosed the details in an announcement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. They are the latest public signs of a spreading corruption inquiry that has brought down one senior Chinese Communist Party official, Jiang Jiemin, and encroached on Zhou Yongkang, the retired head of China’s powerful domestic security administration.        
“As part of their investigations, the regulatory authorities made enquiries about certain projects” of Wison and its subsidiaries, and have “taken books and records and frozen certain bank accounts,” the company said.        
Hua Bangsong, the billionaire chairman and founder of Wison, has been helping authorities in China with the investigation, the company said this month. In its latest announcement, Wison said it had been unable to contact Mr. Hua, and that Zhao Hongbin, a financial manager of a Wison subsidiary, was also “assisting in the investigation.”        
Wison is one of several engineering and equipment companies caught up in the inquiry into the China National Petroleum Corporation, usually called C.N.P.C., and its listed subsidiary, PetroChina, which trades in Shanghai, Hong Kong and New York. PetroChina has been one of Wison’s main sources of revenue.        
Wison, which is part of a group with headquarters in Shanghai, said the Chinese authorities had not told it what precisely they were investigating, or how Mr. Hua and Mr. Zhao were involved. The company suspended trading in its shares in early September.        
In late August, four senior managers of C.N.P.C. and PetroChina were dismissed as part of a party investigation into reported disciplinary violations, a term that usually means corruption. Days later, Mr. Jiang, a former chairman of C.N.P.C., was publicly accused of the same violations and dismissed from his job running the government agency that administers state-owned companies.        
Four people who have spoken with senior Chinese officials have said the real target of the investigation is Mr. Zhou, who retired from the Communist Party leadership at a congress in November, after a career that began as an oil technician and senior manager at C.N.P.C. Xi Jinping, who took over as party leader at the same congress, has repeatedly vowed to curtail official corruption and self-enrichment.        
“Rather than going directly for the target, the strategy is one of encirclement, removing Zhou’s people one by one from the echelons of power,” Neil Beveridge, a senior analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong who specializes in Chinese energy firms, said in a recent research note.

Stocks on Wall Street had a mixed close on Thursday as investors took a breather after a rally that raised major indexes to record levels in the wake of a surprise decision by the Federal Reserve to maintain its stimulus.         
By the end of trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500-share index had lost 0.18 percent, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.26 percent and the Nasdaq composite was up 0.15 percent.        
Earlier in the day, shares in Europe and Asia jumped, and battered emerging market currencies rose, as those markets had their first chance to respond to the news from the Fed.        
On Wednesday, the S.&P. and Dow reached record nominal closing highs — and the Nasdaq reached its highest close since September 2000, when the dot-com boom was fading — after the Fed’s unexpected decision to keep its massive stimulus efforts intact. The Fed will continue, for now, with its $85 billion monthly bond purchases which have propped up economic growth and equity markets for much of the year.        
“Now that we have one worry out of the way, I think the next big catalyst to move the market is the earnings season, which is not too far away,” said Ryan Detrick, senior analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati.        
In economic news, factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region increased by the most in more than two years in September and firms’ optimism about the future hit a 10-year high.        
JPMorgan Chase will pay approximately $920 million in penalties to regulators in two countries to settle some of its potential liabilities from its $6.2-billion “London Whale” derivatives loss last year, according to terms made public on Thursday. JPMorgan shares were down 1.2 percent.        
Rite Aid, the third-largest United States drugstore chain, raised its profit forecast for the current year after reporting a fourth straight quarterly profit. The stock jumped 23.5 percent.        
In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue-chips ended the trading session up 0.7 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London closed 1 percent higher.        
“Clearly a lot of people were wrong-footed by the Fed,” said Philippe Gijsels, chief strategist at BNP Paribas Fortis in Brussels, meaning that they had to change their investment positions and buy stocks.        
“But the Fed tapering is still going to happen,” Mr. Gijsels added. “Maybe now it will be November or December before it happens. This doesn’t change a lot.”        
In Asia, the biggest gainers were those that had suffered most from the past months’ exodus of funds from emerging markets. In Indonesia, the benchmark stock index closed 4.7 percent higher, and in India, where slowing growth, looming elections and a large current-account deficit have helped undermine investor confidence, the Sensex index closed up 3.3 percent.        
The relief spread across the entire region, producing gains of 3.5 percent in Thailand, 2.8 percent in the Philippines, 1.7 percent in Hong Kong and 1.1 percent for the S.&P./ASX 200 index in Australia. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 closed up 1.8 percent.        
The markets in mainland China, Taiwan and South Korea were closed for a holiday.        
Many Asian currencies also rose, with the beleaguered Indonesian rupiah up about 1.5 percent and the currencies of India, Malaysia and Thailand all 2 percent stronger against the American dollar.

JAKARTA — A wave of relief swept across Asia, Europe and Africa on Thursday after the Federal Reserve decided to maintain its pace of monetary stimulus, as investors and governments concluded that the financial environment for emerging markets would be less harsh than expected in coming months.        


Currencies and stock markets across the developing world rose as short-term interest rates held steady in the United States and long-term interest rates actually dipped there, making it more attractive to put money into higher-yielding investments in developing countries for at least a few more months.        
Some of the biggest market increases took place in Indonesia, which has tended to be the emerging market most affected by Fed decisions over the years and the country hardest hit by traders over the past couple of weeks. The Jakarta stock exchange rose nearly 5 percent, and the rupiah gained 4 percent against the dollar.        
The Bank of Indonesia cautiously welcomed the Fed’s decision.        
“For us, this is a short-term relief,” said Difi A. Johansyah, the bank’s chief spokesman and the chief liaison to Parliament and the rest of the Indonesian government.        
“They reduce some of the pressures for capital outflows and reduce the pressure on the rupiah for the time being, but we have to work on our homework to stabilize the rupiah. The root of the problem is domestic, the current account deficit and inflation,” he said in an interview at the central bank’s headquarters seven hours after the Fed’s decision.        
The Fed’s action also gave India some breathing room. The rupee was the worst performer of the world’s 78 internationally traded currencies in August but has started to recover this month. The Mumbai stock market increased 3.3 percent, and the rupee climbed 2.4 percent against the dollar.        
The Turkish stock market soared 8 percent in early trading, and the South African stock market jumped 2 percent. Latin American markets had risen sharply late Wednesday following the Fed’s announcement. But as the currency trading day progressed in Europe and Africa, there were some signs of flagging enthusiasm for emerging markets, as the Turkish lira was down 0.3 percent after an initial jump in value and the South African rand was down 0.6 percent.        
“If liquidity flows to emerging markets revive, those economies that have suffered the most — India, South Africa, Turkey, Indonesia and Brazil — stand to gain,” said Ajay Bodke, the head of investment strategy and advice at Prabhudas Lilladher, a brokerage firm based in Mumbai. “It also increases the maneuverability that the new Reserve Bank of India governor has in charting his medium-term course for the monetary policy.”        
The new governor, Raghuram Rajan, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and chief economic adviser to the Indian government, took office in Mumbai on Sept. 4 and plans to release his first statement and news conference on monetary policy on Friday. At his inaugural news conference on his first day in office, he stuck to banking deregulation.        
Although India and Indonesia have attracted the most attention in recent weeks among emerging economies, other countries’ stock markets and currencies also rallied strongly on Thursday. The Hang Seng Index closed 1.7 percent higher in Hong Kong and the Nikkei 225 closed up 1.8 percent in Tokyo.        
The indexes in Thailand and the Philippines rose more than 3 percent, and the S.&P./ASX 200 index in Australia rose 1.1 percent. European stock markets also rose early Thursday. The FTSE 100 rose 1.4 percent soon after trading opened in London, and the main indexes in Germany and France rose 1.2 percent.        
Among currencies, the Philippine peso and Korean won rose 1 percent against the dollar, while the Malaysian ringgit climbed 2.1 percent. The Japanese yen weakened 0.4 percent against the dollar as investors shifted money out of industrialized countries like Japan and back into emerging markets.        
The big questions now are: How long a respite has the Federal Reserve taken before starting to taper its program of monetary stimulus, and how much damage may have already been done to emerging economies over the past several months by market volatility and capital flight? Most economists regard Fed tapering as inevitable, and still probable in the coming months.

A new study provides the best evidence yet that wearing a back brace will slow the progression of the most common form of scoliosis in adolescents, helping them avoid painful spine surgery.        


Physicians have recommended bracing for more than 50 years, but until now, studies of its effectiveness had produced mixed results. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended against scoliosis screening in schools partly on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence that bracing and other conservative treatments relieved back pain or improved quality of life in these children.        
The new randomized study, published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, should end the longstanding debate, several experts said, and may spur the task force to reconsider its position.        
The trial is “very convincing,” said Dr. B. Stephens Richards, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital in Dallas. “It scientifically proves that brace treatment works for adolescents with scoliosis who are at risk of curve worsening to the point of needing surgery.”        
Adolescent girls are more likely than boys to have idiopathic scoliosis, or curvature of the spine from no known cause. Rigid bracing is worn to restore spine alignment by external force.        
It is a demanding treatment at a vulnerable time of life.        
“When you have a teenager who is anxious about wearing a brace to school or what their friends will think, it gave us a bit of heartache to try to convince them if we weren’t certain ourselves,” said Dr. Paul D. Sponseller, the director of orthopedic surgery at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, who was not involved in the study. “In light of this new evidence, we can say we really do have a basis for putting them through bracing.”        
In the study, researchers analyzed data on 242 patients at 25 sites across the United States and Canada. The children were all aged 10 to 15 and still growing, and they all had a spinal curvature of 20 to 40 degrees.        
Of those patients, 116 were randomly assigned to observation or bracing for at least 18 hours daily. Because too few families agreed to randomization, the researchers added a group of 126 adolescents who chose for themselves between bracing and observation.        
Bracing was deemed a failure if spinal curvature progressed to 50 degrees or more, a point at which surgery is often suggested. It was deemed a success if the child achieved skeletal maturity without this degree of curve progression.        
The trial was stopped early because of the apparent efficacy of bracing.        
In the analysis that included both groups, the rate of treatment success was 72 percent among children with bracing, compared with 48 percent among those under observation. The benefit increased the longer bracing was worn. More than 90 percent of the children who were successfully treated wore their braces more than 13 hours a day.        
Dr. Richards, the immediate past president of the Scoliosis Research Society, said the study’s strengths were the inclusion criteria, limited to adolescents most at risk for spinal curve progression, and the use of a high-tech, temperature-sensitive device in the braces to measure compliance objectively.        
“There were a lot of doctors like me who treat scoliosis as the primary focus of their practice who had doubts about whether bracing was effective,” said Dr. Stuart L. Weinstein, the lead author of the study and a professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Iowa. “Now the jury is in.”        
Bracing has been the standard of care since the 1940s. It took so long to perform a rigorous trial of its effectiveness not only because it was “a gargantuan task,” said Joe O’Brien, the president of the National Scoliosis Foundation, but also because parents did not want to “just sit there and wait and watch.”        
Such a study raised moral challenges, too. “Ethically, you have to accept that some patients will be randomized to not using a brace, and your presumption is they will end up needing surgery,” said Dr. John T. Smith, a professor in the orthopedics department at the University of Utah.        
When her daughter Maddie was given a scoliosis diagnosis at age 10, Becky Houser, of North Liberty, Iowa, wanted to avoid surgery “at all costs.” So Maddie, a participant in Dr. Weinstein’s study, chose to wear a brace.        
“We didn’t want to not do anything,” said Mrs. Houser, who manages rental properties. Thirty years ago, she underwent surgery for scoliosis herself, spending three weeks in a hospital and nine months in an upper-body cast.        
After three years of wearing baggy tops and yoga pants to school to accommodate the brace, Maddie, now 13, was thrilled to learn that her spinal curvature was holding steady at 28 degrees. With no more major growth spurts left, she no longer needs bracing.        
“We are extremely relieved,” Mrs. Houser said.        
A common surgical treatment, spinal fusion, entails putting screws and rods in the spine to straighten it. The procedure has greatly improved, but young patients still face risks like infection, bone healing problems and, rarely, paralysis.        
Despite the apparent success of bracing, the study did not pinpoint which children are most likely to benefit from it. Indeed, the researchers found that outcomes were successful in 41 percent of the intervention group even though they seldom wore the brace.        
Conversely, Erica Shumaker, a high school freshman in Tipton, Iowa, wore her brace 22 hours a day while participating in the study. Yet her spinal curvature progressed, and she is likely to need surgery.        
“Her brace isn’t helping as much as they thought it would,” said her father, Rick Shumaker. “But there’s nothing we would do any different.”

VILAMOURA, Portugal — For Humberto Sousa, life in Vilamoura means there are only two items on his to-do list: choose a beach for the day and select a restaurant for the night.        


Touted as Europe’s largest private resort, the 20-square-kilometer, or 4,924-acre, area in the central Algarve region is not isolated. But for Mr. Sousa, who is based in London, having a second home here means the occasional visit to his native country can be a relaxing time spent with friends and family.        
Now seeking out a different region in Algarve for a vacation home, Mr. Sousa has decided to sell the house, which is listed at €3.2 million, or $4.7 million.        
Vilamoura initially was created in 1966 by a banker from Porto, Antonio Cupertino de Miranda; the current developer is Lusotur, owned by the CatalunyaCaixa savings bank.        
What seems to be the resort’s strongest attraction is the privacy provided by its large building plots. Mr. Sousa’s five-bedroom villa sits on a 4,277-square-meter, or 46,037-square-foot, site in the resort’s oldest and most exclusive neighborhood, Pinhal Velho, Portuguese for “old pines.”        
The 605-square-meter, single-level, white concrete home, purchased by Mr. Sousa in 2007, was designed by Castello Branco architects of Lisbon to include the outdoors. Each of the ensuite double bedrooms — decorated by Mr. Sousa and entered from a cheerful orange hallway — features a large sliding glass door that allows guests to slip out onto the back patio or head for the pool without disturbing others.        
The villa’s back patio runs the width of the house and is shaded by a pergola and an established pine tree that pushes up between two of the white concrete beams. The gently sloping lawn runs down to a square pool near the bottom of the property and, through a cluster of pines, to the adjacent Millennium golf course. A neighbor’s home is almost completely obscured by pines.        
With wind-whipped, red stone cliffs to the west and dry, hilly land to the east, Vilamoura sits conveniently in central Algarve, making up one point of what locals call the Golden Triangle of exclusive properties; the other two are Vale do Lobo and Quinta do Lago. Pleasingly set among scores of old pine trees — one of Mr. Sousa’s favorite aspects of the region — the resort boasts a tennis academy, equestrian center, 865-berth marina and five golf courses.        
For golfers, the total of 12 golf courses in the Golden Triangle area — which includes the Victoria course for the Portugal Masters — is a dream, for as Mr. Sousa pointed out, “The worst thing for a golfer is to know a golf course too well.”        
Mr. Sousa says he always has been pleased by the resort’s proximity to major highways, which means he can be in Lagos in 40 minutes or Tavira in 25. The Algarve region boasts five Michelin-starred restaurants, one of which in Vilamoura, but even a traditional Portuguese dinner offers a lesson in the local art of grilling fish. “All you do is choose which fish you want, and it’s served with boiled potatoes and the special ‘Algarve salad’: tomato, lettuce, grilled green pepper and olive oil,” Mr. Sousa explained.        
Although Vilamoura attracts teenagers from nearby resort towns to its famous clubs, Mr. Sousa said the area is a fine choice for families and even offers an international school. The resort also recently put in a biking and jogging path that weaves around Mr. Sousa’s neighborhood and throughout the well-manicured landscape.        
While four- to six-bedroom homes at this vertex of the Golden Triangle sell for €2 million to €4 million, or $2.7 million to $5.3 million, villas of similar dimensions in the other two exclusive areas come with a higher price tag, ranging from €4 million to €7 million.        
For several decades, Algarve has drawn hordes of British tourists to its beaches, many of whom eventually purchased villas as second homes, rentals or investments. While the majority of recent purchases by foreigners still are made by British and Irish buyers, there are growing numbers from northern Europe, Russia and Brazil.        
Portugal’s economic crisis has seen the housing market stumble over the last four years, although Suzana Bento, managing director of Mapro Real Estate in the nearby town of Almancil, said things finally are starting to look up this year.        
One factor may be the Golden Visa program, introduced in November 2012, which offers residence permits and, possibly, citizenship, to foreigners who spend a minimum of €500,000 for real estate or make other business investments, according to a government Web site. The program already has drawn Chinese and Indian investors, Ms. Bento said.        
Also, retired expatriates who live part time in Portugal can become exempt from Portuguese taxation on their pensions.

WASHINGTON — Few American presidents have held a deeper belief in the power of the written word than President Obama. And in few ways has that belief been more tested than in his frustrating private correspondence with the leaders of Iran, a country with which the United States has had no diplomatic ties for 34 years.        


This week, Mr. Obama indicated that he might finally have found a pen pal in Tehran.        
At the core of Iran’s recent diplomatic charm offensive — a process that has included the release of 11 prominent political prisoners and a series of conciliatory statements by top Iranian officials — is an exchange of letters, confirmed by both sides, between Mr. Obama and President Hassan Rouhani.        
The election of Mr. Rouhani, a moderate, in June kindled hopes that diplomacy might end the chronic impasse with Iran over its nuclear ambitions. But the letters, and the cautious hope they have generated, suggest there is a genuine opportunity for change.        
It is not the first time since entering the White House that Mr. Obama has put pen to paper to try to sway Iran’s leadership. Until now, he has had little to show for it: even under the pain of punishing economic sanctions, the Iranian government has shown little interest in negotiating a deal with Washington on its nuclear program.        
This time, Mr. Rouhani said in an NBC News interview broadcast on Wednesday, the tone of Mr. Obama’s letter was “positive and constructive.” He added, “It could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future.”        
Mr. Obama, speaking to the Spanish-language network Telemundo on Tuesday, said there were indications that Mr. Rouhani “is somebody who is looking to open dialogue with the West and with the United States, in a way that we haven’t seen in the past. And so we should test it.”        
The president has tested Iran before. Having promised as a candidate to extend an olive branch to old enemies, he sent a letter early in his first term to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, proposing a new diplomatic chapter. Ayatollah Khamenei sent a reply, but failed to take Mr. Obama up on his offer.        
Their correspondence was cut short after Iran’s disputed presidential election in June 2009 unleashed a popular uprising. The ensuing bloody crackdown all but snuffed out diplomacy for the next year. The re-elected president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, wrote a lengthy letter to Mr. Obama in 2010, but it did nothing to break the diplomatic ice.        
The White House declined to discuss the contents of Mr. Obama’s letter to Mr. Rouhani. But a senior administration official said it reflected the president’s judgment that Mr. Rouhani should be taken “very seriously,” in part because he appeared to have a broad mandate within Iran.        
This is the first time that Mr. Obama has written directly to an Iranian president, and not the supreme leader. That suggests that the White House believes Ayatollah Khamenei has empowered Mr. Rouhani, at least for now, to seek an opening with the West.        
Mr. Ahmadinejad, though not as hostile to a nuclear agreement as sometimes portrayed, was undermined by other senior officials and did not enjoy the supreme leader’s full confidence.        
“The administration’s previous position was that we correspond with the person who makes decisions,” said Ray Takeyh, an Iran expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Now they’re sending them to Rouhani.”        
Another major difference is that the new exchange of letters comes in the wake of the administration’s agreement with Russia to seek the peaceful transfer of Syria’s chemical weapons. To make that plan work, analysts said, it would be helpful for Iran, as the staunchest regional ally of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, to play a constructive role.        
Whether that is possible is highly questionable, of course. But it gives Mr. Obama a broader diplomatic context in which to engage Mr. Rouhani. The United States has generally insisted on negotiating with Iran purely on its nuclear program, which has left both sides with little to talk about after the inevitable clashes over the number of centrifuges or the amount of enriched uranium that the Iranians are producing.        
“At the end of the day, Obama stumbled into diplomacy because of what happened with Syria,” said Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, who has written a book about Mr. Obama’s diplomatic efforts, “A Single Roll of the Dice.”        
Iran’s news media have reported that Mr. Obama’s letter included a plea to re-engage in diplomacy; a suggestion — depending on how any talks went — that the United States would be willing to ease sanctions; and a request to initiate direct discussions between Washington and Tehran, something diplomats say is critical to striking a nuclear deal.        
None of this should be a big surprise. The United States has long been eager for direct talks with Iran. The bigger question is whether Mr. Rouhani is in the position to make concessions on a nuclear program that Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes and that the United States suspects is aimed at achieving the ability to produce nuclear weapons.        
If direct negotiations were to begin, Mr. Obama’s letter-writing skills might again be called into play. “Presidential correspondence,” said Dennis B. Ross, who advised Mr. Obama on Iran at the White House, “is used often in negotiations as a form of assurance or clarification.”        
Mr. Ross said the president’s reliance on letters to Iranian leaders made sense because in the absence of a formal relationship, “there are few other fully authoritative ways to convey a message we completely control.” The letters, his advisers say, also reflect the value that Mr. Obama attaches to direct diplomacy.        
Mr. Obama and Mr. Rouhani both plan to speak to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday. Will they try an even more direct form of diplomacy: greeting each other in person? The White House says nothing is planned.        
For now, though, Mr. Obama’s pen-pal diplomacy has accomplished the most basic goal of any letter. It got a reply.

LONDON — The beauty of the Champions League, and the beast within it, were in full display on the second night of the tournament.        


We should never tire of admiring Lionel Messi, surely the finest artist in the sport. At times his rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo seems to defy the accepted wisdom that soccer is a team game.        
How do we account for Ronaldo scoring a hat trick in Istanbul on a Tuesday, and then Messi rising to the challenge and notching three impudent goals of his own in Barcelona the following evening?        
Each Messi goal came from his left foot, the first an immaculate 25-yard free kick that brushed a post before it nestled in the top corner of the net. Goals 2 and 3 were low, deft placements as the little Argentine dared defenders to touch him, and then he dodged them as they tried.        
With another goal headed in by Gerard Piqué, Barça hammered Ajax, 4-0.        
Messi’s accumulation of score after score in the Champions League has given him the best goals-to-games ratio since European club competition began in the 1950s. His 62 goals in 80 matches compares to Raúl’s 71 in 144, Ruud van Nistelrooy’s 60 in 88, Andrey Shevchenko’s 59 in 116, and Ronaldo’s 54 in 96.        
One almost feels sorry for Ronaldo. Even his career total of 21 hat tricks does not match Messi’s 24.        
Yet Wednesday wasn’t simply one special player’s night. The Swiss team FC Basel came from a goal down to defeat Chelsea, the 2012 European champion, 2-1, on Chelsea’s turf in London.        
That was historic because Basel had visited England 10 times before, without winning once. Chelsea scored first, through their Brazilian player Oscar, but little by little, the Swiss team that cost a pittance compared to Chelsea overhauled that lead.        
First Mohamed Salah, a 21-year-old from Egypt, curled a shot around fullback Ashley Cole, using the defender to hide the ball from goalkeeper Petr Cech until it was too late.        
Then Marco Streller, Basel’s 32-year-old captain, guided the ball inside Cech’s near post with a header following a corner kick.        
José Mourinho, back as Chelsea coach six years after owner Roman Abramovich fired him, said that he was not shocked by the defeat and that he would be at his workplace at 7 the next morning to put it right.        
“We were punished in our defensive corner where we are strong,” Mourinho said. “Emotionally this is not a very mature team.”        
His implication is that Chelsea needs rebuilding. John Terry did not play at all, and Frank Lampard was missing from the midfield at the end, so Chelsea was lacking in leadership. The owner visited the players’ dressing room afterward, and one good question for him to ask was why Fernando Torres, the man for whom Chelsea paid £50 million, or $80 million, was not even on the bench. And why Juan Mata, last season’s most inspirational forward, appeared only as a substitute.        
Chelsea, it has to be said, is trying to be a different team from the first one that Mourinho built into a pragmatic and methodical, but winning, unit.        
“I would like to say it was a miracle, but we made it in Tottenham, and we made a draw in Manchester,” Streller said, referring to draws in previous Europa and Champions League matches. “Once it was 1-1 tonight, I told the boys we can win here.”        
He smiled before adding, “And they listened to me.”        
On the same night, Arsenal stretched its run of away victories in the Champions League to a record-breaking 10 straight games. Arsenal’s French coach, Arsène Wenger, took his team to southern France, where it beat Marseille, 2-1.        
“We have been audacious away,” explained Wenger, “where sometimes we play with the hand brake at home because we lack that confidence.”        
His team rode its luck in a patchy first hour, during which the diminutive Mathieu Valbuena often gave Marseille the edge in creativity. But after Marseille had missed their chances, Arsenal capitalized on a defensive howler from Jérémy Morel.        
His attempt to clear with a header looped into the air, and as it dropped, Theo Walcott kept his eye on the ball and sweetly volleyed it high and handsomely into the goal. Twenty minutes later, Aaron Ramsey allowed the moving ball to cross in front of him, then outwitted his markers with a smart turn and a low shot that deflected off the foot of defender Nicolas N’Koulou into the net.        
In stoppage time, one Marseille brother, André Ayew, won a penalty kick that the other, Jordan Ayew, converted. That was a mere consolation: Arsenal, the club that paid €50 million, or $67 million, for one player, Mesut Özil, had beaten Marseille, which spent slightly less than that to acquire six new team members in the summer.        
Food for thought there. The best — the players who can make a world of difference — come at a price that fewer and fewer teams can afford.        
One club that came close last season to disproving that theory was the Champions League finalist Borussia Dortmund. In the pouring rain in Southern Italy on Wednesday, Dortmund lost more than the game against Napoli.        
The German side conceded goals to Gonzalo Higuaín and Lorenzo Insigne, and with Juan Zúñiga gifting Dortmund an own goal near the end, the match finished 2-1 in favor of Napoli.        
Dortmund compounded defeat by losing its dignity. Its goalkeeper captain, Roman Weidenfeller, was red-carded before halftime after rushing out of his penalty area and deliberately using his hands to prevent a scoring opportunity.        
But Weidenfeller’s was an impulsive mistake. What Dortmund’s coach, Jürgen Klopp, did midway through the first half was beyond condoning. He was outraged by the opening Napoli goal while his defender, Neven Subotic, was off the field, being treated for an injury.        
Klopp, often the joker of Dortmund, raged at the fourth official, mocking him, bawling into his face, appearing to physically threaten him. Rightly, Klopp was sent to the stands, and no doubt UEFA will ban him for further matches. But this is the beast of soccer, the ugly face that any right-minded parent will not allow their children to view on YouTube.

PRAGUE — Reconstructing a protected yet neglected property in Prague’s historic Old Town is a challenge Olena Yakubovych, head of Y&T Property Investment, fully embraced.        


In early 2012, she came across a disused Functionalist-style residence on a quiet side street, just steps from the city’s National Theater, and envisioned an apartment building with a trio of luxury units that became Art Residence National Theater.        
In Prague, “the top end of the property market has remained unscathed by the economic crisis,” Ms. Yakubovych said, adding that there continued to be demand for luxury properties in the city, particularly in the Old Town, an area on the list of Unesco World Heritage Sites.        
The area, originally a medieval settlement dating from the ninth century, now is a collection of architectural styles, including neo-Gothic, Renaissance, Cubist and Functionalist.        
For Ms. Yakubovych, the development of a luxury property must reflect the building’s history, combining original features with modern touches. “The flats that we like to do the most are in traditional buildings from the beginning of the 20th century,” she said. “I always try to see the potential in an old building. Sometimes I can even picture the design of the door handles.”        
The Art Residence building dates from the mid-1930s and was one of the first buildings in the city to use a steel-reinforced concrete structural system, rather than the traditional wooden core.        
The renovation, which included replacing the damaged roof, required permits from five authorities. While the bureaucracy may seem daunting, many observers say it has helped preserve the Old Town as the number of historic renovations has increased.        
“The single hardest issue with working on buildings in the historical center is balancing the client’s wishes with what the city authorities will allow,” says Danyal Downer of Ian Bryan Architects, a local agency. “The heritage department is often seen as the enemy, but the truth is that without their intervention, the city center would quickly lose its charm.”        
Art Residence’s flagship apartment, named L’Art de Vivre, covers the building’s top floor, offering special views of the National Theater from the kitchen’s dining nook.        
The two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath property is on the market for 34 million Czech koruna, or $1.76 million. The two other units already have been sold: the 205-square-meter, or 2,207-square foot, Gallery apartment for 24 million koruna and the 105-square meter Mosaic apartment for 12 million koruna. Both of those apartments are on the sixth floor of the building; the units on the lower floors were sold as unfinished shells.        
L’Art de Vivre apartment has 165 square meters of living space, with a 110-square-meter terrace off the living room. It runs the length of the apartment and offers glimpses of Prague Castle, Petrin Hill and the Astronomical Clock, as well as the National Theater and the Academy of Sciences. The main bedroom has its own 48-square-meter terrace.        
The apartment was named after a 1917 vessel now used as a river cruising barge in France, a title inspired by the slanting roof of the main room, which Ms. Yakubovych said brings to mind a hull.        
The bas-relief wood paneling in a stormy sea gray that is used throughout the apartment sets off the décor’s lighter creams, whites and grays. The fittings include inlaid marble flooring in the foyer, hidden walk-in closets and storage space, as well as private elevator access. Parking and extra storage are available in the basement, next door to the Laboratorio Scuola di Cucina cooking school, which shared its official opening with the unveiling of Art Residence in May.        
The apartment reflects the building’s name, with modern chandeliers in the living room and bedroom created by the glassworks Preciosa in the town of Jablonec nad Nisou. Also, Ira Svobodova, a local artist, created a series of abstract, geometric paintings for the apartment, most of which were sold at the launch party on May 22. Ms. Yakubovych and Ms. Svobodova have cooperated on projects previously.        
For Ms. Yakubovych, the Art Residence reflects both its interior design and the surroundings. “With this property, the location is key,” she says. “This area is very interesting because it’s very close to everything.”        
The developer says she believes such projects are the future of Old Town, as they will draw more residents into the city center and revitalize it as more than just a tourist spot.

LONDON — When a judge ruled that a 22-year-old Muslim defendant must remove her full-face veil during testimony — albeit behind a screen so that only the judge, jury and lawyers might track her facial responses — there was much heady talk about the implications for Europe’s restless and unresolved struggle with issues of faith and identity, tolerance and freedom.        


But a pithier riposte came from Salma Yaqoob, a Muslim and former city councilwoman in Birmingham who rhetorically asked a reporter from The Guardian whether the full-face veil, the niqab, should really absorb so much debate in a land seized with far broader social and economic challenges.        
“Is this the biggest issue we face in the U.K. right now?” she asked.        
But it was not an issue that was likely to go away: four days after the court ruling, there were reports that 17 hospitals had also ordered staff to remove full-face veils when in contact with patients. And the question arose whether the furor was not so much about the niqab, a supposed symbol of piety, as the telltale marker of a deeper sense of difference between faiths, sharpened by years of war in Muslim lands abroad that wrenched Britain’s social fabric at home.        
The debate is not new. In 2006, questions about the niqab arose in the case of Aishah Azmi, a 24-year-old teaching assistant who was dismissed from her job for refusing to remove the full-face veil in class.        
At that time, a year after the London bombings of July 2005, Britons were in a state of shock after their brutal encounter with Islamic militancy when four suicide bombers killed 52 travelers on the London transit system.        
Tony Blair, then the prime minister, called the full-face veil “a mark of separation,” contradicting the vaunted strivings of a society that, for decades, sought to place ethnic and religious diversity ahead of enforced integration.        
The temperature of debate this time seems lower, but there are other portents.        
Britain’s Muslim population is significantly bigger — rising from 1.6 million, or 3 percent of the population in 2001, to 2.8 million, according to the Washington-based Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, an increase that makes Britain’s Muslim minority Europe’s third most populous after those in France and Germany.        
While congregations dwindle in traditional Christian churches, Islam is growing. Society is changing, offering new challenges and perhaps a new assertiveness among Muslims that unsettles those who expect a degree of pliancy from their minorities.        
“Britain has a proud tradition of attracting and welcoming religious minorities, of offering them refuge from persecution and a place where they can practice their faith freely,” the conservative Daily Telegraph said in an editorial. “But one reason why our society is both diverse and relatively peaceful is because we ask that people respect our values and do not resist integration.”        
In this week’s court case, Judge Peter Murphy ruled on a core principle, established over centuries, of open justice, saying that if “a fair trial is to take place, the jury and for some limited purposes the judge must be able to assess the credibility of the witnesses.”        
“In my judgment, the adversarial trial demands full openness and communication,” Judge Murphy said. “I am fairly convinced that the wearing of the niqab necessarily hinders that openness and communication.”        
By inference, too, the case raised questions about the state’s right to curtail individual freedoms, particularly in the name of security concerns.        
“I think it’s for women to make a choice about what clothes they wish to wear,” said Theresa May, the home secretary. “If they wish to wear a veil, that is for a woman to make a choice.”        
But, she continued, “There will be some circumstances in which it’s right for public bodies, for example at the border, at airport security, to say there is a practical necessity for asking somebody to remove a veil.”        
The debate is not limited to Britain or Europe, suggesting a broader social questioning as the tectonic plates of religion seem to shift.        
France, for instance, outlawed the wearing of the full-face veil in public places two years ago. Under rules reflecting the country’s distinctive and cherished secularism, religious symbols like crucifixes, Jewish yarmulkes and Islamic head scarves are banned from schools in France. According to the daily newspaper Le Monde last month, the authorities now want to extend the prohibition to universities.        
In Quebec, the separatist government released a plan last week to prevent government workers from wearing “overt and conspicuous” religious symbols, including an array of turbans, skull caps and large crosses.        
Part of the debate is about a sense that clear lines of demarcation between faith and society — the essence of French secularism — ultimately build greater cohesion than Britain’s permissive multiculturalism.        
“In England, they get into fights and throw bombs at one another because of multiculturalism, and people get lost in that type of society,” said Premier Pauline Marois of Quebec.        
Yet, despite their divergent policies, France and Britain have both been convulsed by attacks in their own cities in the past 18 months by young descendants of immigrants from former colonies drawn to radical Islam as they turn against societies from which they feel alienated.        
The attack last May in southeast London on Lee Rigby, an off-duty British military drummer, provoked a sharp increase in anti-Muslim episodes by small far-right groups, arguably presenting far more of a challenge than the debate over the niqab. “It cannot be right,” said Farooq Murad, the secretary general of the mainstream Muslim Council of Britain, “that a minority community is allowed to be targeted in this manner.”

MOSCOW — In a combative essay published Thursday in the online newspaper Pravda.ru, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, declared himself to be “pro-Russian” but delivered a blistering attack on President Vladimir V. Putin, describing him as presiding over a failed petro-state and as a quasi dictator who rules “by corruption, repression and violence.”        


Mr. McCain’s article was intended to answer an Op-Ed column by Mr. Putin in The New York Times on Sept. 12 that made the case against President Obama’s threatened military strike on Syria. Mr. Putin’s column, in which he presented Russia’s position as defending international law and respect for state sovereignty, generated fierce debate, including praise and accusations of hypocrisy.        
While Mr. Putin’s article focused more generally on American foreign policy, Mr. McCain, who has long been a sharp critic of the Kremlin, focused squarely on the Russian president himself. In his introduction, though, Mr. McCain made an effort to dispel the idea that he is anti-Russian, a perception that is widespread here.        
“I am not anti-Russian,” Mr. McCain wrote. “I am pro-Russian, more pro-Russian than the regime that misrules you today.”        
“I make that claim because I respect your dignity and your right to self-determination,” he continued, addressing the Russian people. “You should be governed by a rule of law that is clear, consistently and impartially enforced and just. I make that claim because I believe the Russian people, no less than Americans, are endowed by our creator with inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” he added.        
While Mr. McCain wrote that he did not believe a Russian citizen could publish similar criticism, such complaints appear frequently in the Russian press — especially online, where there is generally no censorship even as the government retains fairly strong control over what is shown on the major television stations, particularly in news reports.        
Mr. Putin, speaking Thursday at an annual conference of Western academics and policy analysts, ridiculed Mr. McCain for submitting the article to Pravda, which he suggested was proof that the American senator was locked in an outdated cold war mind-set.        
“I think that he has a certain deficit of information about our country,” Mr. Putin said.        
“And the fact that he wanted to be published in Pravda, not any other publication, apparently he wants to be published in a most authoritative publication with big circulation,” Mr. Putin added, mockingly. “Of course, Pravda is a respectable publication of the now oppositional Communist Party, but its level of distribution in the country is minimal.”        
Mr. Putin insisted that there was nothing anti-American in his article in The Times, and he said Mr. McCain had been invited to the conference, called the Valdai Discussion Club after the Russian town where it is held.        
Mr. Putin usually holds a private dinner with the Valdai group, but to note the event’s 10th anniversary, the invitation list was broadened to include several opposition politicians and journalists who were given limited access.        
Mr. Putin used his remarks and a question-and-answer session to touch on a wide range of subjects, and he portrayed the event itself as proof that there was no suppression of speech in Russia.        
At one point, Mr. Putin defended a new Russian law banning propaganda on nontraditional sexual relations, which is widely perceived as intended to suppress homosexuality. He said that the law did not discriminate, but also that “Europeans are dying out” in part because of societal acceptance of gay relationships.        
Even as he suggested that Mr. McCain was stuck in the past, Mr. Putin raised his own complaint with a cold war edge.        
“Once, we were promised that NATO will not cross the eastern border” of Germany, he said. “We discussed it and Gorbachev was given a promise, though it was not registered anywhere. And now, where is NATO? And where is the border? We were simply duped.”        
Mr. McCain cited the propaganda law in his article, criticizing Mr. Putin’s government. “They write laws to codify bigotry against people whose sexual orientation they condemn,” he wrote.        
He did not defend United States policies, but accused Mr. Putin of shielding the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. “How has he strengthened Russia’s international stature?” Mr. McCain asked. “By allying Russia with some of the world’s most offensive and threatening tyrannies.”        
Mr. McCain was not the first member of Congress to respond to Mr. Putin in the Russian news media.        
On Monday, Kommersant, one of Russia’s most prominent daily newspapers, printed an open letter to the Russian people by Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.        
In his letter, which he also published on his Web site, Mr. Israel explained in leveled language why he would potentially vote in favor of a military strike on Syria, although he praised Mr. Putin’s efforts to persuade Mr. Assad’s government to surrender its chemical weapons arsenal.        
“Diplomacy should always be the first preference,” Mr. Israel wrote.

FRANKFURT — Lufthansa announced its largest-ever aircraft order on Thursday, saying it would buy 59 Airbus and Boeing wide-body jets, including a new version of Boeing’s 777 jet.         
The deal, worth 14 billion euros, or almost $19 billion, at list prices, expands a sweeping fleet renewal by Lufthansa, Europe’s largest airline by revenue. The German carrier confirmed an order for 100 Airbus short-haul planes in March.        
Lufthansa said the order for 34 Boeing 777-9X and 25 Airbus A350-900 jets, which the supervisory board approved on Wednesday, would help it cut fuel consumption and shrink unit costs by about 20 percent compared with old aircraft models.        
The airline, which is in the middle of a deep revamp that includes 3,500 job cuts, is investing in modern jets to cut its fuel bill and catch up with Middle Eastern rivals, particularly in the hotly contested routes between Europe and Asia.        
The new aircraft would mainly replace the existing aircraft at Lufthansa, with the older Boeing 747-400s and Airbus A340-300s to be phased out by 2025.        
Lufthansa did not give a breakdown of how many of the planes would be firm orders and how many would be options. It said the first of the new planes would be delivered as early as 2016.        
The order is the largest single private-sector investment in the history of Germany industry, according to Lufthansa, adding it would safeguard about 13,000 jobs at Lufthansa alone.

Weekend,"










THREE-QUARTERS of an hour before sunrise, Melvin Van Peebles glided up the sleeping West Side, a slender man in an orange hoodie, leading a reporter on his five-times-a-week morning run. His legs were toned and without blemish, his hair and beard a gentle white. He had a story about why he was tired on this September morning, but it is not suitable for publication, and might not be true, anyway.        


“Don’t ask me something if you don’t want to know,” he said. “Because I will tell you.”        
Mr. Van Peebles, best known for his pioneering 1971 independent film, “Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song,” just turned 81, but for most of those years he has seemed brand-new. Now, in an exhibition called “eMerge 2.0: Melvin Van Peebles & Artists on the Cusp,” running through Nov. 7 at the Strivers Gardens Gallery, on West 135th Street in Hamilton Heights, he is making his public debut as a visual artist. That adds to a résumé that includes filmmaker, composer, actor, novelist, Wall Street trader, San Francisco cable car driver, playwright, bandleader, vocalist and, by his own account, bon vivant.        
“My Tuesday girlfriend’s husband wanted to take me out on Wednesday,” he began one story. (The rest is best left to your imagination.)        
Mr. Van Peebles would like to bring out a line of sneakers and sportswear next. After that, who knows? As a pink dawn illuminated the Hudson, he gestured toward the George Washington Bridge in the distance. “Sometimes I run across and then back,” he said. “That’s about 20 miles.”        
The morning was crisp, the light was golden, and the two runners were panting lightly, neither likely to survive a run to New Jersey and back. “We’ve got our health,” Mr. Van Peebles said, stopping at a bench in Riverside Park. “We are truly blessed.”        
The Strivers Gardens exhibition features two paintings from his art collection, along with his own mixed-media work “Ex-Voto Monochrome (A Ghetto Mother’s Prayer),” a large rectangle of framed blue concrete flanked by two white feathered wings. Like his films and plays, it combines an urban social consciousness — a mother’s prayer is for her child’s safe deliverance, he said — with a sense of DIY mischief, as if he had created it just because someone said he couldn’t.        
On this day in early September, the work hung in the living room of his Hell’s Kitchen co-op, surrounded by a decade’s worth of his puckish installations: a giant hot dog and bun that double as a file cabinet for his assistant; the back end of a Volkswagen bus, mounted on the wall; a plaster wood stove called “Ancient Tenement Entertainment Center (Minus the Door)”; a rooftop skylight in the middle of the floor, complete with fake bird droppings.        
Mr. Van Peebles offered a tour, brandishing an unlit cigar stub and changing from coffee to a little rum at about 8 a.m. Although he has not exhibited these works, he said that art making was less a new chapter for him than an intersection of two old ones. He studied art as a teenager at the Art Institute of Chicago and earned money in the 1950s painting portraits in Mexico; he has always improvised, adjusting his path according to whim and opportunity, whatever the obstacles, he said.        
“Why not have fun, man?” he said. “If I feel like doing something, I just go ahead and do it.”        
Lately, this has meant fronting a funk and soul band called Melvin Van Peebles wid Laxative (so named for their productivity) and working with young admirers like Peter Wright, known as Souleo, 28, a curator who helped put together the gallery show. Lee Walker, 40, a filmmaker, is meanwhile hustling a vision of Melvin Van Peebles athletic gear, to be followed by a line of books and perhaps animated films.        
“We’re looking at some offers now,” Mr. Walker said of the sportswear manufacturers. “He’s 81 years old with abs.” Asked what he had learned from Mr. Van Peebles, he said: “He knows how to treat the money. You got to hold onto it.”        
Mr. Van Peebles said he has been drawn to visual art lately because it does not require raising money or running a big production. His filmmaking career has been one of fighting with Hollywood over money and opportunities, with Mr. Van Peebles always living to fight another day. This time, he said, he is able to use his name to give other artists exposure.        
“It’s such a privilege,” he said of the exhibition, which includes two paintings by George Helton, a former assistant’s husband, who died in 1984. “This is what I fought for, to make it accessible to the people.”        
In the meantime, he keeps working and running, letting the world know he is still at it.        
“I’ve had very narrow escapes, let’s say,” he said. “For example, if somebody hits me, or this or that, my first thought is, wow, I’m still around here to get hit. Wow, ain’t that great?”        
He added: “I’m not going to let the accolades come to me when I’m in a wheelchair. ‘Get a little more feeble, Melvin, and we’ll recognize you.’ Right now I’m a little too dangerous. I intend to stay dangerous.”        
The morning light streamed onto his terrace. Mr. Van Peebles disappeared into another room and put on a vinyl album of one of his soundtracks, all composed using numbers instead of notes because he never learned musical notation.        
When the song ended, he lifted the needle and put on another soundtrack, louder than the first.        
“Now don’t take this too personally, but I’m having a wonderful time,” he said. “We don’t get this too often, where we can just enjoy ourselves, etc. etc.”        
But you couldn’t help thinking that Mr. Van Peebles gets this all the time.

In the best of worlds, before marrying, people would discuss their feelings about extended family, like: How many barbecues a month do I really want to spend with my in-laws?        


“I can’t count the number of couples I’ve seen where it seems like someone is still married to their family,” said Winifred M. Reilly, a Berkeley-based therapist who has been practicing for 33 years and writes the blog Speaking of Marriage.        
In this week’s Unhitched column, a couple lived in a house built on the husband’s family land. Over time, the wife found living so close to her in-laws stifling, contributing to the divorce.        
“For every invitation I declined, four more appeared,” she said.        
By the time couples visit Ms. Reilly, many have already gone to war over how much family time is too much.        
One of the first things Ms. Reilly advises is to stop threatening your spouse.        
She described a husband who would regularly visit his mother on weekends, taking along the couple’s young children. The wife wasn’t invited because her mother-in-law didn’t like her and made it unpleasant for her to be there.        
The husband said that his wife was being selfish because he wanted the children to have a good relationship with their grandmother. And the wife was angry that he and the children were away so much.        
First, Ms. Reilly talked with them about making their points without getting derailed on side issues like whether the wife had a bad temper.        
The therapist probed for underlying causes.        
In this case, the wife’s father died when she was young and having her husband leave to visit his mother so often recreated that feeling of loss she had as a child.        
And the husband felt he had a special obligation to go because his mother was a widow and needed him.        
He should some empathy about how emotionally painful it was for her to be left behind; she needed to understand that he was doing the proper thing as a son to visit his mother and was not just escaping his wife.        
“Things get better when people say ‘I’ve got a dilemma and you’ve got a dilemma’ as opposed to ‘you should just do what I want.'”        
The husband came to understand why his leaving was so stressful for his wife; the wife learned to control her feelings of abandonment and articulate why she wanted him and their children home. The two stayed married.        
Ms. Reilly recently saw a couple who were battling because the wife’s mother kept giving candy to the grandchildren and letting them stay up late when she was baby-sitting them.        
The husband wanted his wife to confront her mother, but when she did, the mother disregarded her daughter’s concerns. The husband wanted his wife to “lay down the law” and she felt her husband was being too hurtful and heavy-handed. They were stuck.        
The turning point came when the grandmother bought a toy for the grandchildren even though she was asked not to load them up with gifts.        
This time, instead of blaming his wife for not standing up to her mother, he asked, “How do you want to handle this?”        
Through therapy, the husband realized that pushing and threatening don’t work, Ms. Reilly said. “It was his way of recognizing that change had to come from her.”        
That gave the wife an opportunity to take a productive next step, suggesting the two of them talk to her mother. It turned out that the wife liked having her husband present, for moral support.        
The couple no longer fought about the grandmother’s actions. The grandmother did listen to the couple, and though she occasionally overstepped, her actions didn’t weaken the marriage.

1913 Art Treasures Are Rushed to America 
NEW YORK — Because of the fear that Congress will place a more stringent tariff on works of art, there will be more antiques offered for sale in New York in the coming season than in London, Paris and Berlin combined. All the steamships have been bringing precious cargoes of antiques, and this department of the Custom House is more crowded than ever before. Art dealers several months ago started in to forestall possible action by Congress and have been preparing for it by bringing vast quantities of antiques from Europe.        
 
1938 Viennese Shift Traffic to Right 
VIENNA — Today [Sept. 19] the Czech crisis was temporarily forgotten over the excitement caused by the shifting of street traffic from the lefthand side to the right. Throughout their lives the Viennese had been accustomed to drive on the lefthand side and to look out to the left when they crossed the streets. This changed suddenly on Sunday when the clocks struck midnight, giving the signal to thousands of motorcars and other vehicles. Vienna and the surrounding country were the last left driving regions in Greater Germany.        
 
1963 Peking Seeks Friendship of Neutralists 
TOKYO — Communist China has mounted an offensive in the fields of diplomacy, trade and subversion — directed at the non-Communist world generally and the so-called uncommitted nations in particular. A three-month survey of countries in Africa and the Middle and Far East indicates that thus far the Chinese have had only a few middling successes — but this is just the beginning. Evidence of this offensive on the diplomatic front has been noted in the Middle East. Iraq has been a target of Moscow over the Arab country’s purge of local Communists and its war with the Kurds.

One-quarter of all divorces now involve people over 50. In Unhitched, longtime couples tell the story of their relationships, from romance to vows to divorce to life afterward.  


Dennis Hummer, now 45, met Nancy Hess, now 53, working at a church camp in 1988. Over 18 years of marriage, they learned they wanted to spend their time differently from each other. They divorced after Ms. Hess fell for another man. The couple did not have children, but now Mr. Hummer, who remarried and is now stepfather to two girls, find he loves being a “bonus” dad.        
Marriage: June 8, 1991, to April 28, 2009.        
Age when married: He: 23, She: 31.        
Occupation: She is a human resources manager consultant. He has been a health care manager, restaurant owner and now works for a homebuilder.        
Where did they grow up? 
He: Rural Pennsylvania, on a family homestead.        
She: Bexley, Ohio.        
The single biggest reason for marrying? 
He: Very romantic at heart. He was searching for a partner and believed he had met the woman he would spend the rest of his life with.        
She: She saw the potential for a good partnership and thought they complemented each other well. She was introverted; he was extroverted.        
Where did they live after marrying? 
Briefly in Harrisburg and central Pennsylvania, and then rural Pennsylvania on his family’s land.        
What brought them together? 
Opposites attracted. He found her worldly (she was eight years older), attractive, creative, a great conversationalist about politics and women’s rights. He admired her artistic skills; she painted beautiful watercolors.        
She found him funny, and enthusiastic whether cooking dinner or building furniture. She respected his fearlessness in facing big projects, whether baling hay or building a barn. He was popular and outgoing.        
Shared values? 
For 10 years after they married, they volunteered at the Methodist church camp. where they had met. Neither wanted children. Both were moderate politically, but were headed in different directions on the political spectrum though they didn’t know it at the time.        
The first signs of trouble? 
He: There was no “aha” moment. He thought their relationship “quirky and unconventional” because they often did their own thing, including taking separate vacations. Increasingly he found himself attending family functions on his own. Though it bothered him, he adapted and didn’t think it warranted divorce.        
She: Having built their house on his family’s land, over time she felt stifled by living so close to his relatives and also by their social demands. “For every invitation I declined, four more appeared,” she said. He would get up at 4 a.m. for coffee with his father before work. Ten years into the marriage, on returning from a solo vacation she felt a “tinge” of dread. It surprised her.        
What pushed them apart? 
He: Less time together magnified their differences; he loved old cars and motorcycles; she painted, read and hiked.        
She: His family’s conservative politics played a part. She wrote a letter to the local paper supporting gay rights. Though he agreed with her opinion, he asked her to keep her views to herself to maintain peace in the family. She began to feel isolated and believed he was more aligned and closer to his family than he was to her.        
When she learned her family carried the gene for Huntington’s disease, she was hit hard. Though she tested negative for the disease, she started to question her choices.        
The breakup? 
When the two took a European cruise, she met a professor 30 years her senior. He became a friend to both of them. She didn’t act on it, but after they began an e-mail correspondence, she felt an attraction.        
She: She felt she had met someone who understood her and what she was seeking from life.        
He: When she started spending lots of time e-mailing and conversing with their new friend, he felt threatened.        
What did they do to try and stay together?  
There were long talks about the relationship. They were no longer making decisions together. They saw a counselor.        
He: After a few sessions of couple’s counseling, he saw the therapist by himself. He thought the counselor believed the relationship wasn’t salvageable and was preparing him for divorce.

PARIS — A Lithuanian customs officer in Kosovo working for a European Union mission there was shot dead on Thursday in the Serb-dominated north of the country, European Union officials said.        


The European Union mission that oversees judicial affairs in northern Kosovo said in a statement that the shooting took place early Thursday during a routine staff rotation. It said a murder investigation was under way. Bernd Borchardt, head of the mission, known as Eulex, called the attack an unequivocal “ambush,” said Stojan Pelko, a European Union spokesman.        
Mr. Pelko said by telephone from Pristina, Kosovo’s capital, that six customs officers traveling in two cars were returning from a border crossing when one of the cars was fired on, critically wounding the Lithuanian customs officer. He was dead on arrival at a hospital. The Associated Press, citing a hospital chief, said the man had been shot in the chest and leg. Mr. Pelko said the other officer in the car, a Czech, had no visible wounds, but had been taken to the hospital.        
He said that it was not known how many people were involved in the attack and that the area had been sealed by police officers. “We don’t know who shot him, and the perpetrator escaped,” he said. “We are asking citizens for any information they can provide and we are looking for witnesses.”        
The European Union mission condemned the attack, calling it “an act of cowardly violence.” The bloc’s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, condemned the killing and called on Serbs and ethnic Albanians to redouble efforts to press ahead with an agreement aimed at overcoming ethnic enmities in the country.        
The shooting came as Kosovo and Serbia have been trying to carry out a power-sharing accord that the two countries signed in April. The agreement, under which Serbia agreed to recognize Pristina’s authority over the police and the courts in the north in return for greater autonomy for Kosovo’s northern Serbs, has been greeted with deep ambivalence and in some cases outright hostility by some of the north’s 50,000 Serbs.        
While the agreement stops short of Serbs’ recognizing Kosovo’s independence, which Belgrade vehemently opposes, it has been lauded by the European Union, which brokered it, as a breakthrough that could help overcome ethnic divisions and cement peace in the region. Some Serbs, however, have vowed to resist the accord, boycott municipal elections planned for early November and leave Kosovo.        
The European Union mission has been overseeing the police, courts and customs in Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. While a majority of Serbs reject Kosovo’s independence, the north in particular has remained a conflict zone because, until recently, a majority of Serbs there lived almost entirely under Belgrade’s authority. Serbian flags fly in the Serbian part of Mitrovica, locals drink Serbian brew and Belgrade has paid the salaries of municipal officials.        
Georgios Makeroufas, a political adviser to the European Union’s Rule of Law Mission in northern Kosovo, said from Kosovo that it was too early to assess the fallout from the killing or whether it would further inflame ethnic tensions. But he emphasized that so far, “Things are relatively quiet.”        
But analysts said the European Union faced a daunting challenge to ensure that the power-sharing agreement was put into effect, with resistance from many Serbs in the north, as well as from a vocal minority of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, who argue that the accord entrenches divisions.        
In a sign of the obstacles ahead, staff members in the offices granting Kosovo identification cards in the north have had hand grenades lobbed at their homes, while one senior administrator was shot in the leg late last year.

Angela Merkel has a reputation as something of an enigma. Biographers, commentators and political opponents have created a cottage industry of Merkel astrology around a leader that everyone finds hard to read.        


With a general election scheduled in Germany for Sunday, a poll at which the chancellor is likely to win a mandate for a third term, speculation is rife about Merkel’s political course, especially on foreign policy.        
But contrary to widely held beliefs, the chancellor’s positions are in fact not all that difficult to identify. Merkel has basically made three fundamental decisions that have defined the structure of her foreign policy.        
The first decision was to ensure that Germany rejected any kind of geopolitical ambition. The country has been a very useful enabler of the European Union’s foreign policy in the Western Balkans, but it has shied away from strengthening Europe’s diplomatic or military capabilities in more substantial, structural ways.        
The same is true for NATO, where Germany has forwarded a number of initiatives on technical issues, but is seen as disengaged from the bigger strategic discourse on the future of the Western alliance in a changing global security landscape.        
Merkel has, unenthusiastically, heeded old German military commitments in Afghanistan and Kosovo, but she has kept Germany firmly out of entanglements in the new type of crisis-management operation that is emerging from the crises in Libya, Mali and Syria. In all of this she can feel safely in agreement with the overwhelming majority of the German public.        
In the absence of larger, more global ambitions, what matters most in assessing Merkel’s foreign policy are her decisions in relation to Europe. This is where the crisis of the European single currency has forced her, against her instincts, to become a decisive player and a risk-taker. It is in this field that Merkel’s other two fundamental foreign policy decisions fall, and it is here that her foreign policy legacy will be defined.        
Her second decision was to turn the euro zone into a de facto “transfer union lite” by guaranteeing the currency’s survival with pledges of billions of German taxpayer euros. In return, she has since been pushing for immediate structural economic reforms in the recipient countries, combined with medium- to long-term projects such as fiscal union and joint oversight instruments like the European Stability Mechanism.        
A banking union is still in limbo but might complete the picture in the not-so-distant future. All of these efforts have one thing in common: more or less strict oversight over a nation’s financial and economic policies. None of this would have been thinkable only a few years ago.        
This means, in simple terms, that Merkel has presided over a substantial deepening of E.U. economic integration. With the measures she has taken to remedy the crisis now firmly in place, the European Union has integrated faster and more substantially than in any previous five-year period. True, most of this has not been wholly voluntarily. Much of it was dictated by the crisis. But in the end, it was largely Merkel who designed or enabled these great integrationist leaps forward.        
Merkel’s third decision is perhaps the most fateful one. The German chancellor has determined that she favors a politically less integrated Europe after the crisis. In August, she announced in a radio interview that now was the time to think about giving some powers back from Brussels to the member states.        
She did not go into specifics, but added that Europe, from now on, would not necessarily require more common policies with decisions made by the Brussels-based institutions. Improved governance could be achieved through better coordination among member states.        
This victory for Merkel’s long-standing intergovernmental instincts over an age-old German pro-integration tradition is nothing less than revolutionary, particularly when compared with the ideology of Helmut Kohl, under whose tutelage she entered the political stage. Perhaps it is meant to counterbalance the enormous push toward closer economic integration. But it is clear that, again, Merkel has allied herself with the majority of Germans who think that Europe’s economic side is great, but that its political side is increasingly sinister.        
Merkel’s third decision is risky. First of all, it rests on the flawed assumption that economic and political integration can be separated from each other, when the basic lesson of the euro crisis is that you can’t have one without the other.        
Second, it fatefully ties her to the politically weakened British prime minister, David Cameron, who shares her vision of “repatriating” many government functions and favoring intergovernmental deal-making over the E.U.’s classic community method, but whose inability to control his own party is causing him existential problems at home.        
Third, Merkel’s decision rips the very engine out of the entire integration idea: that Germany, Europe’s historically problematic core country, underwrites the ever-fragile idea of European politics transcending the merely national.        
Of Merkel’s three fundamental foreign policy decisions, strategic abstention is understandable but unsustainable in the long run; her recipe to tackle the crisis is probably correct but could create severe collateral damage; and her intergovernmental turn revolutionizes the integration project by risking some of its historic achievements.        
Expect Merkel’s post-election foreign policy to be built around these three foundations. If it works out, which it could, it is pure genius. If not, generations from now, historians will wonder what drove that enigmatic woman.

CAIRO — Gunmen killed a senior police officer and wounded 10 other officers on Thursday when security forces raided a bastion of Islamist support on the outskirts of Cairo, redoubling fears of a violent backlash against the recent military takeover.        


The officer, Gen. Nabil Farag, the assistant security director for the province of Giza, was killed when a large convoy of tanks and other armored vehicles rolled into the town of Kardasa, across the Nile from Cairo, in an attempt to flush out Islamist militants hiding there.        
An unidentified gunman appeared to have shot the general soon after security forces arrived in the town. In video of the shooting, the general is conspicuous in a white uniform and black protective vest, chatting at ease in an open lot with an Egyptian television news reporter. After a burst of automatic gunfire, the general falls to the ground bleeding from a wound to his side, and the reporter and others — none wounded — begin calling for help.        
The police abandoned the town on Aug. 14, the day security forces killed several hundred Islamist protesters at sit-ins in Cairo and militants stormed Kardasa’s police station in retaliation. After battering it with rocket-propelled grenades, the militants executed about a dozen officers and mutilated their bodies, according to security officials and video of the remains.        
The attack on the Kardasa police station was the bloodiest on security forces outside Sinai since the military ouster of President Mohamed Morsi on July 3, which enraged his Islamist allies in the Muslim Brotherhood. Security officials say militants have killed more than 120 police officers across Egypt. Nearly 50 of those were killed in fighting when soldiers and police officers broke up the Islamist sit-ins on Aug. 14; more than 50 other officers have been killed in the relatively lawless Sinai, including two dozen on a single day last month.        
But the killing on Thursday in Kardasa — a rural town that is a 20-minute drive from Cairo — is the second episode in two weeks to raise the prospect that the violence could spread to the capital, where the government forces are strongest.        
On Sept. 5, a car bomb exploded on a busy Cairo street in an attempt to assassinate the interior minister during his morning commute. Although he survived, the bombing killed at least one police officer and one civilian, and wounded more than 20 others.        
The police raid on Kardasa was the second operation this week aimed at apprehending fugitive Islamist leaders in a town dominated by opponents of the new government. Both were conducted in tandem with the army.        
On Monday, a convoy of armored vehicles and police trucks occupied the town of Dalga, in Minya Province south of Cairo, where the worst attacks on Egypt’s Coptic Christian minority have occurred since Mr. Morsi’s ouster. Security officials, however, said the operation was mainly an unsuccessful attempt to capture Assem Abdel Maged, a veteran leader of Gamaa al-Islamiya, which led an armed insurgency in the mid-1990s but has since renounced violence.        
Security officials said Thursday that their forces in Kardasa had briefly traded gunfire with local militants as soldiers and riot police officers began to surround the town just after dawn. General Farag was on the front lines, officials said.        
“General Nabil Farag was shot during the first 20 minutes of entering the town,” Gen. Medhat el-Menshawi, head of the police’s special operations unit, said in a television interview. Despite the video footage of General Farag being shot, he said the general was wounded “in the middle of random shooting by terrorists who were trying to stop us from entering Kardasa” and died when he reached a nearby hospital.        
General Menshawi said that by midafternoon, 57 “terrorist elements” had been arrested. He insisted that, in contrast with previous operations, none were arrested arbitrarily. “Today there have not been any random arrests,” he said. “All of those who were captured had arrest warrants issued against them by the prosecution, and we targeted them by their names.” There were no reports of other fatalities.        
The extent of the resistance to the raid was difficult to determine. The police barred almost all journalists from entering the town, but evidently invited crews from several pro-government satellite networks to film the operation. (General Menshawi said the news media had “pushed us for the operation.”)        
The satellite networks broadcast live footage throughout the day, interrupted by adulatory interviews with the officers in charge. By midmorning, one network was broadcasting scenes of groups of riot police officers milling in the streets.        
A group of six officers in security vests posed for the cameras in front of an armored vehicle. Three others pointed their guns at the necks of two captives kneeling with hands tied behind their backs. Later footage showed officers raiding homes and taking prisoners.

“It needs more psychic atmosphere,” said Fiona Shaw, the distinguished actress and, as of last month, the director of the Metropolitan Opera’s new production of Tchaikovsky’s “Eugene Onegin.” She was standing in an aisle in the Met’s auditorium during a rehearsal break one recent Friday, staring up at the stage like it was a gifted child having trouble fulfilling its potential.        


The new “Onegin” was being a bit of a troublesome child itself. Putting on opera is always full of unexpected turns and unpleasant compromises. But this “Onegin,” which opens the Met’s season on Monday, has taken an unusually precipitous tumble from sure thing — a pinnacle of Russian music, featuring the most eminent Russian soprano and Russian conductor of our time, in a production by a widely admired theater director making her Met debut — to headache-plagued.        
For one thing, that admired director, Deborah Warner, who led the production’s first iteration at the English National Opera in 2011, underwent an unexpected surgical procedure this summer and couldn’t come to the Met. Ms. Shaw, her longtime collaborator (on Broadway productions of “Medea” and “The Testament of Mary,” among others), who had also never directed at the Met, took on the assignment at what in opera amounts to the very last minute.        
The Met approved the switch even though Ms. Shaw had a partly overlapping commitment to direct Britten’s “Rape of Lucretia” for the Glyndebourne Festival’s fall tour back in England, a project she had no intention of shortchanging. (She has also directed three productions for the English National Opera since 2008.) So after starting rehearsals for “Onegin” on Aug. 13, Ms. Shaw left New York on Sept. 6. Her only subsequent visit to the city was that recent Friday, Sept. 13, to work on the first and third acts and give notes to the cast before flying back in the evening.        
She stood in the darkened auditorium, half-illuminated behind the lighting board, in constant motion, seeking atmosphere, while the soprano Anna Netrebko poured out her heart onstage and Valery Gergiev conducted, with his customary inscrutable hand flutters, in the pit.        
Ms. Shaw pointed to a spot on the stage, then another and another. The lights would change as she went, making abrupt shifts from cool white to rich yellow and back again as she and the designers tried out different options for the classic story, drawn from Pushkin’s verse novel, about missed attempts at love between a bookish girl and a bored aristocrat.        
With the addition of some light from the wings, a scene that had seemed stark suddenly turned warm; a forbidding character became, in the glow of a well-placed spot, heart-wrenching. Atmosphere gradually emerged, but the work was complex, slow and frustrating, and Ms. Shaw needed to get a lot done in very little time.        
The down side of her arrangement with the Met was that Ms. Shaw was never able to see the second act — with its grand ball scene and harrowing duel — onstage with the orchestra, not to mention any of the show’s final run-throughs. Nor, as of press time, did she plan to return for opening night. All of this is extremely unusual for such a prominent production, particularly at the Met, which these days loudly and proudly touts its theatrical bona fides.        
“The basic direction is done,” said the Met’s general manager, Peter Gelb, in an interview. “Most of the detail work is done, now it’s really a question of just following it up and making sure people remember what they’re supposed to be doing.”        
Mr. Gelb said that he and the production team could together handle the execution of what he called Ms. Shaw’s “meticulous notes” in her absence: “There’s always some amount of fine-tuning going on, but the basic blocking of the movement of the performers, everything they’re doing, is set.”        
Direction in a production’s final stages, though, is not just about setting the blocking. It is also about tiny details, about being on the scene to approve small yet telling shifts — from the lights to the acting — and to experience the full production and make last-minute suggestions. “It’s an unusual situation,” Mr. Gelb acknowledged.        
Besides the scheduling issues with Ms. Shaw, there is the matter of the petition. The online petition, that is, signed by almost 9,000, that criticizes President Vladimir V. Putin’s antigay policies in Russia, that says Tchaikovsky was gay (which many music scholars believe but is not universally accepted at the moment) and that calls on the Met to dedicate the opening-night performance to the issue.        
Mr. Putin, who in June signed the law banning “propaganda on nontraditional sexual relationships,” is not as distant from this “Onegin” as one might think. He has been a crucial backer of Mr. Gergiev, the director of the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg. Mr. Putin was the featured speaker at the gala opening of the gleaming Mariinsky II theater in May, when he also awarded Mr. Gergiev a recently revived Soviet-era prize, the Hero of Labor award. Mr. Gergiev and Ms. Netrebko were vocal supporters of Mr. Putin’s 2012 presidential campaign.        
The Met, while expressing its displeasure with the law, has resisted the idea of dedicating opening night to anything.

ATHENS — The perfect political storm for violent extremism has descended on Greece. It consists of national humiliation, economic disaster, high immigration, political division and international tutelage. Look no further than Weimar Germany to understand its ingredients.        


In the subdued streets of the Greek capital, where a vague menace hangs like a pall, tempers are frayed. The economy is turning slowly, after draconian cuts and two bailouts totaling €240 billion, but not enough yet to be felt. The cry of the extreme right resounds: We, the fathers of civilization, have been sold out by the international loan sharks!        
These are familiar insinuations. It is well known where they can lead. The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party is rising, from a negligible fringe group in 2009 to what is almost certainly the country’s third political force today, representing close to 15 percent of the vote, according to polls. If the most acute phase of Greece’s economic crisis has passed, the most acute phase of its political trial is upon it.        
I have little doubt that if Greece were not part of the European Union, with the protection and example afforded by this much maligned democratic club, it would have tumbled into catastrophe by now, much as a humiliated Germany did after 1918. Europe has been Greece’s protector even as the single euro currency has been its tormentor.        
A typical confrontation occurred the other morning. Alex Soultos, who works in the jewelry business, was in a shouting match. A graduate of Northeastern University who returned to Athens from Boston in 2009, he was making his way through a crowd of strikers outside the Ministry of Administrative Reform and E-Governance when he lost it.        
“You should be working instead of blocking the road!” he screamed, his American work ethic boiling up. His business is in a downward spiral in an economy that has shrunk by a quarter.        
A group of women screamed abuse back at him. At our age, they demanded, where can we find jobs? They are among the 2,000 “school guards” who were ousted as the government scrambled to find 12,500 public employees it could shift by the end of this month to meet a deadline set by Greece’s international creditors. “We have bills,” Vespina Papadopoulou shouted.        
But as Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the minister responsible for the cuts, explained to me inside the besieged ministry, the message from the “troika” (the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank) is clear: “If you don’t do it, no more money!” Europe’s requirement is: Reform or else.        
Greece, with an estimated $3.3 billion shortfall in its social security fund this year and a larger financing gap looming over the next two years, still needs money, if much less than before. More urgently, it needs international understanding. The combination of the demands of the troika (widely seen by Greeks as a Trojan horse for Germany) and the frustration evident outside the ministry — Soultos’s private sector has lost close to 1.5 million jobs as unemployment has reached 28 percent — is combustible.        
I watched Antonis Samaras, the conservative prime minister, give an impassioned speech this week in which he spoke of the way “Democracy breeds its own enemy, which is basically extremism.” He warned that Greece was in the “blind spot” before improvement is felt — a few “crucial” months that “are not the most difficult” but are “the most politically sensitive.”        
Golden Dawn has been on a rampage. The police say one of its activists was responsible for the stabbing to death this week of Pavlos Fyssas, a leftist hip-hop singer who had denounced the party. In recent weeks Golden Dawn supporters have manhandled a mayor trying to honor victims of the Civil War and attacked Communist Party sympathizers, leaving nine hospitalized.        
Samaras is squeezed between the demagoguery of this rampant right and the populism of the left-wing anti-austerity Syriza party, which is promising to restore most if not all of what has been lost since Greece, in the local phrase, fell from the clouds.        
Troika officials will visit Athens next week. If they make further demands for cuts in wages and pensions they could push Greece over the edge. Germany has not yet learned to play the benign superpower. It is time; and after the German election this Sunday there may be a little more wiggle room. Toughness toward Greece has played well in Germany but, as Mitsotakis put it: “The country has been stretched to its limits. This needs to be very, very clear.”        
In fact, of course, Germany has also saved Greece from bankruptcy. It did so for the European Union, which helped usher Germany from its cataclysmic “zero hour” of 1945. Through Europe, Germany came back. Through Europe, Greece has been saved from the fate of Weimar. At a time when pettiness surrounds thinking about the E.U., and the assumption is widespread that the Union’s peacemaking role is over, it is critical to recall that the Union is Europe’s surest safeguard against the Continent’s darkest hours.

Jackie Lomax, a British rock singer and guitarist who recorded with his Liverpool neighbors George Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr but never achieved the stardom that many had predicted, died on Sunday while visiting the Wirral, a peninsula on the Irish Sea near Liverpool. He was 69 and lived in Ojai, Calif.        


The cause was cancer, said Peter Purnell, the chief executive of Angel Air Records, which plans to release Mr. Lomax’s most recent album, “Against All Odds,” in January.        
Mr. Lomax, a soulful singer with cheekbones like cliffs, was well regarded on the Liverpool rock ’n’ roll scene of the early 1960s. As a teenager he sang and played bass guitar for the Undertakers, a group that performed at the Cavern Club, in Liverpool, and in Hamburg, Germany, as did the Beatles.        
Brian Epstein, the Beatles’ manager, began managing Mr. Lomax in 1966, when he played with a band called the Lomax Alliance. In 1968, Harrison sponsored Mr. Lomax as a solo artist for Apple Records, the Beatles’ newly formed label, suggesting that he record as his debut single “Sour Milk Sea,”  a song Harrison had written during a spiritual pilgrimage to India that year. The recording featured Harrison, Mr. McCartney, Mr. Starr and Eric Clapton.        
“There I am in the studio and there are three Beatles watching me,” Mr. Lomax was quoted as saying on the Apple Records Web site. “That choked up my throat a bit.”        
But “Sour Milk Sea” was overshadowed by two hits released by Apple at the same time, “Those Were the Days,” by Mary Hopkin, and the Beatles’ “Hey Jude.” Mr. Lomax’s debut album, “Is This What You Want?,” was produced by Harrison and was released in 1969, but received little attention.        
John Richard Lomax was born on May 10, 1944, in the town of Wallasey on the Wirral. After leaving Apple he moved to Woodstock, N.Y., and made two solo albums for Warner Brothers, enlisting musicians like Rick Danko and Levon Helm of the Band. He made two more solo albums for Capitol after settling in California and worked in catering and at hotels to help support himself. In 2001 he released “The Ballad of Liverpool Slim” on Angel Air.        
Mr. Lomax’s second wife, the former Annie Richardson, died last year. His survivors include his daughters, Vicki, Louise and Janine, all from his first marriage, to Dionne Armitage; five grandchildren; and a stepson, the photographer Terry Richardson.

When the Brooklyn Democratic establishment gathered for breakfast at Junior’s a few days after the primary election, most eyes were on Bill de Blasio, the presumptive nominee for mayor, who doled out hugs and kisses as he navigated the room.        


But in the background, several members of the City Council — none of them from Brooklyn — were also working the crowd. As guests dined on eggs and lox, Mark S. Weprin from Queens, Annabel Palma from the Bronx, and Daniel R. Garodnick from Manhattan, whose wife had given birth to the couple’s second son days before, made their way to each table, shaking hands and greeting people with “Hey, how are you?” and “Great to see you!”        
There was no need to explain why they were there.        
“The unsaid thing is that they’re all running” for Council speaker, Frank R. Seddio, the chairman of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, said later.        
The speaker of the Council, elected by the members, is, arguably, the second most influential official in the city, and the position will become vacant in January, when the current speaker, Christine C. Quinn, leaves office after her defeat in this year’s race for the Democratic nomination for mayor.        
Ms. Quinn, who was elected speaker in 2006 (defeating Bill de Blasio, who last week defeated her in the primary) brought a new forceful power to the post, and imposed discipline on a panel that had previously been viewed as unruly. She used her position to block legislation that she (often in alliance with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg) opposed and, likewise, to rally votes for legislation that she supported.        
The election to replace her will not take place until January, after the members elected in November take office. But the campaigning has been under way for months, and has intensified since last week’s Democratic primary, since, if history is any guide, almost all members of the Council will be Democrats.        
By tradition, county party organizations play a significant role in the election of the speaker, in some instances essentially dictating votes, after horse-trading involving committee chairmanships and patronage jobs. And ideology plays a role, too — although the post will be chosen by Democrats, some of the Council’s Democratic members are significantly more liberal than others.        
The choice is complicated, as so many things in New York City politics are, by gender and race. Although whites make up a minority of the city, it appears highly likely that the next mayor will be a white man (both the Democratic and Republican nominees are white men) and also likely that the next comptroller will be a white man (the Democratic nominee is heavily favored). The outcome of the race for public advocate — the only other elected citywide post — is unclear: There will be a Democratic runoff, between a black woman and a white man, on Oct. 1 (there is no Republican candidate).        
“If there is no black or Latino on the Democratic ticket, I think there’ll be a lot of pressure to pick a minority member for speaker,” George Arzt, a veteran Democratic political consultant, said. “You can’t have four white men.”        
Multiple members have been mentioned as candidates — in addition to Mr. Weprin, Mr. Garodnick, and Ms. Palma, they include James Vacca of the Bronx, Inez E. Dickens and Melissa Mark-Viverito of Manhattan, and Jumaane D. Williams of Brooklyn.        
Mr. Williams, who is African-American, said in an interview that picking a member of a minority group as speaker should be “a priority.”        
“I think that is something that should be pushed,” he said.        
Beyond ethnicity, all of the candidates have strengths and weakness. Ms. Dickens was a close ally of Ms. Quinn, which could be a problem for her if Mr. de Blasio chooses to get involved in the race. She has also been the subject of several negative stories in The New York Post recently about her role as a landlord in Harlem.        
Mr. Garodnick, who had originally planned to run for comptroller this fall, withdrew his candidacy after Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, decided to drop his mayoral bid and run for comptroller instead. That may have earned Mr. Garodnick some good will with Mr. Stringer’s allies, including Representative Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan.

With a makeshift lineup of rookies and call-ups, the Mets pulled off a ninth-inning rally that no one saw coming.        


Josh Satin hit a two-run single to cap a four-run outburst that sent New York past the San Francisco Giants, 5-4, Wednesday night, moments after Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada broke his right leg.        
Shut down by Matt Cain for almost eight innings, the Mets fought back against San Francisco’s bullpen. Pinch-hitter Zach Lutz had a run-scoring double and Juan Centeno, making his major league debut, singled in a run off closer Sergio Romo (4-8).        
“If there’s anything that typifies what we’re trying to do here, it was that ninth inning,” Mets Manager Terry Collins said. “When you’re playing the world champions, down by three, Matt Cain is mowing you down, it might be easy to say to yourself, ‘We don’t belong here.' ”        
Satin had a career-best three runs batted in, including a sacrifice fly against Cain in the eighth. Vic Black (2-0) pitched a perfect inning for the win.        
Gregor Blanco hit a two-run homer off Mets starter Aaron Harang.        
“To lose one like this is not easy to swallow,” Cain said.        
Tejada was injured when he tumbled over sliding left fielder Andrew Brown to catch a pop-up in the ninth inning. Tejada, who knocked shins with the oncoming Brown, initially stayed in the game but was lifted for Lutz in the bottom of the inning.        
“Right up until the last second, I thought he was going to miss me,” Brown said.        
Tejada will be sidelined six to eight weeks before he can begin rehabilitation, ending his disappointing season, which included a strained right quadriceps and a long demotion to the minors.        
“When he came in, we knew it was bad,” Collins said. “I feel bad for Ruben. He’s worked hard to get back here.”        
Santiago Casilla walked two in the ninth before giving way to Romo, who threw 25 pitches in the series opener Tuesday night. Lutz lined a one-out double and Centeno looped a single that was fielded on one hop by shortstop Brandon Crawford in short left field.        
“It’s great to see those guys come through when you need them,” Collins said.        
Matt den Dekker walked before pinch-hitter Omar Quintanilla flied out to shallow right, keeping the bases loaded.        
Satin then lined a game-ending single into left field and greeted a rush of happy teammates with open arms near first base.        
“It’s a lot different under the bright lights here at Citi Field, but to rally like that here is pretty cool,” Satin said.        
It was Romo’s fifth blown save in 40 chances.        
“I was trying to give him a break, but when you walked a couple of guys, you go to your closer,” Giants Manager Bruce Bochy said. “He was fine to go. I already had him warming up.”        
Cain managed only two outs July 10 in a 7-2 loss to the Mets, the lone time in 264 career starts that he failed to get out of the first inning. This time, the right-hander was on top of his game.        
He scattered six singles over 7 2/3 innings and did not allow an earned run. New York pushed only one runner to second base before the eighth.        
“He was great. He pitched well. It’s a shame we couldn’t get a win for him,” Bochy said. “You have to give them credit on coming from behind. They almost did it last night, and they did it tonight.”

Six months into his papacy, Pope Francis sent shock waves through the Roman Catholic church on Thursday with the publication of his remarks that the church had grown “obsessed” with abortion, gay marriage and contraception, and that he had chosen not to talk about those issues despite recriminations from critics.        


His surprising comments came in a lengthy interview in which he criticized the church for putting dogma before love, and for prioritizing moral doctrines over serving the poor and marginalized. He articulated his vision of an inclusive church, a “home for all” — which is a striking contrast with his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, the doctrinal defender who envisioned a smaller, purer church.        
Francis told the interviewer, a fellow Jesuit: “It is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time. The dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent. The church’s pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently.        
“We have to find a new balance,” the pope continued, “otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards, losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel.”        
The pope’s interview did not change church doctrine or policies, but it instantly changed its tone. His words evoked gratitude and hope from many liberal Catholics who had felt left out in the cold during the papacies of Benedict and his predecessor, John Paul II, which together lasted 35 years. Some lapsed Catholics suggested on social media a return to the church, and leaders of gay rights and gay Catholic groups called on bishops to abandon their fight against gay marriage.        
But it left conservative and traditionalist Catholics, and those who have devoted themselves to the struggles against abortion, gay marriage and artificial contraception, on the defensive, though some cast it as nothing new.        
“Nobody should try to use the words of the pope to minimize the urgent need to preach and teach about abortion,” said the Rev. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, who said he spoke Thursday about the “priority of the abortion issue” at a Vatican conference.        
The interview with Francis was conducted by the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, editor in chief of La Civiltà Cattolica, an Italian Jesuit journal whose content is approved by the Vatican. Francis, the first Jesuit to become a pope, agreed to grant the interview after requests from Father Spadaro and the editors of America, a Jesuit magazine based in New York.        
Father Spadaro conducted the interview during three meetings in August in the pope’s spartan quarters in Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican guesthouse, where Francis said he had chosen to live because it is less isolated than the papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace. “I cannot live without people,” Francis told Father Spadaro.        
The interview, kept under wraps for weeks by the Jesuits, was released simultaneously on Thursday morning by 16 Jesuit journals around the world. Francis personally reviewed the Italian transcript, and it was translated by a team into English, said the Rev. James Martin, an editor at large of America.        
“We have a great pope,” said Father Spadaro in a phone interview from his office, surrounded by Italian journalists. “There is a big vision, not a big shift. His big vision is to see the church in the middle of the persons who need to be healed. It is in the middle of the world.”        
The pope’s words are likely to have repercussions in a church whose bishops and priests in many countries, including the United States, have often seemed to make combating abortion, gay marriage and contraception their top public policy priorities. Francis said that those teachings have to be presented in a larger context.        
“I see the church as a field hospital after battle,” Francis said. “It is useless to ask a seriously injured person if he has high cholesterol and about the level of his blood sugars. You have to heal his wounds. Then we can talk about everything else.”        
From the outset of his papacy in March, Francis, who is 76, has chosen to use the global spotlight to focus on the church’s mandate to serve the poor and oppressed. He has washed the feet of juvenile prisoners, visited a center for refugees and hugged disabled pilgrims at his audiences. His pastoral presence and humble gestures have made him wildly popular among American Catholics, according to a recent Pew survey.          
But there has been a low rumble of discontent from some Catholic advocacy groups, and even from some bishops, who have taken note of his silence on abortion and gay marriage. This month, Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, R.I., told his diocesan newspaper that he was “a little bit disappointed in Pope Francis” because he had not spoken about abortion. “Many people have noticed that,” he said.        
The interview is the first time Francis has explained the reasoning behind both his actions and omissions. He also expanded on the comments he made about homosexuality in July, on an airplane returning to Rome from Rio de Janeiro, where he had celebrated World Youth Day. In a remark then that produced headlines worldwide, the new pope said, “Who am I to judge?” At the time, some questioned whether he was referring only to gays in the priesthood, but in this interview he made clear that he had been speaking of gay men and lesbians in general.

BookReview,"










The singer-songwriter, whose album “The Last Ship” will be released this week, says his favorite novels are really extended songs: “What is ‘One Hundred Years of Solitude’ if not an opera?” 


What’s the best book you’ve read so far this year? 
I enjoyed Hilary Mantel’s “Bring Up the Bodies,” almost as much as I enjoyed its predecessor, “Wolf Hall.” Her portrait of Thomas Cromwell is complex and largely sympathetic to a character that is usually cast darkly and exclusively as Henry VIII’s “muscle.” I enjoyed Nathaniel Philbrick’s treatment of the American War of Independence in “Bunker Hill” for similar reasons, a well-researched story proving to be more nuanced and compelling than a well-established myth.        
If you had to name a favorite novelist, who would it be? 
Mark Twain, for the perfect combination of plot and character in “Huckleberry Finn.”        
What kinds of stories are you drawn to? 
I like personal dramas set within the sweep of historical events: Colum McCann’s “TransAtlantic” and “Let the Great World Spin,” or Ian McEwan’s “Sweet Tooth.”        
We have to ask about Nabokov. How does it feel to have turned on a generation of junior high schoolgirls to “Lolita”? Are you a Nabokov fan? 
Is that true — that my appalling rhyme led a mass migration to the linguistic cosmos of Nabokov? I don’t think so, but then, they could have gone to worse places.        
In what ways do the books you read figure into the music you write? 
Songwriting is of course a very different art to that of the novelist — condensing sometimes large ideas into rhyming couplets seems to be the opposite process.        
But it is interesting to me how often a novel will begin with a quote from a poem or a song, so the territories do overlap to some extent. My favorite songs are narrative songs, short stories that can be recounted in three minutes. My favorite novels are extended songs. What is “One Hundred Years of Solitude” if not an opera? And a grand one at that!        
You’ve written a memoir, “Broken Music.” What was that experience like for you — the writing itself, and the publication and reception of the book? 
I began to realize while writing and remembering that memory is a neural muscle, and once you begin to stretch it, it grows to accommodate everything that has ever happened to you, often things you might prefer to forget. But the abiding emotions that sustained me through the process were gratitude and forgiveness; to use the newly developed muscle otherwise is largely a waste of time. I think people were surprised that I wrote almost exclusively about my early life, before the distorting lens of fame and success, and the well-worn clichés of celebrity.        
What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves? 
The complete works of P. G. Wodehouse, for their innocent escapism.        
Do you ever read self-help? Anything you recommend? 
A self-help book? Isn’t that an oxymoron?        
What book has had the greatest impact on you? 
Probably Bulgakov’s “Master and Margarita,” a delicious and disruptive satire of Soviet Russia. I hear a dead man was put on trial in Moscow only this past summer; Woland would have loved it!        
If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? 
“Meditations,” by Marcus Aurelius — Stoicism and the limitations of power. “When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own — not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine.”        
Did you grow up with a lot of books? 
We only had two in the house, an illustrated Old Testament and Volume 1 of Encyclopaedia Britannica. I was well versed in everything from “aardvark” to “azimuth,” but little else. The public library became a sort of refuge. I never throw a book away now. I have kept every dog-eared paperback I have ever read. Books are the only things I’m acquisitive about. And no, I don’t lend my books . . . join the library!        
Do you have a favorite childhood literary character or hero? 
I imagined myself as Jim Hawkins in “Treasure Island,” an innocent among thieves and cutthroats. It must have been the first book I ever read from start to finish, with unforgettable characters, Long John Silver, Blind Pew, Ben Gunn. . . . The Black Spot still terrifies me.        
What books are on your coffee table? 
Albert Camus: “Solitude and Solidarity,” a beautiful and evocative portrait of the man and the writer, edited by his daughter Catherine, and Ellen Von Unwerth’s “Fräulein.”. . . Well, what did you expect?        
Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn’t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing? 
I’m no critic. It’s hard enough writing a book without some opinionated parvenu dismissing your work because he wasn’t in the mood or is too daft to catch your drift. Mind you, anything with the word “Code” in the title, I will avoid like the plague!        
If you could meet any writer, dead or alive, who would it be? What would you want to know? 
I’d like to ask Shakespeare if he composed while walking, or was he entirely sedentary?        
What do you plan to read next? 
I’m weighing “My Lunches With Orson” against Daniel C. Dennett’s “Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking.”        
Any plans to write another book? 
Oh yes! I definitely want to give it another crack!

Foreign,"










These excerpts are from the full interview published in English by America magazine, a Jesuit weekly based in New York.  


In his most extensive and revealing interview since he was elected in March, Pope Francis sat for a series of talks in August with a fellow Jesuit, the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, the editor of the leading Jesuit journal in Rome. The pope, formerly a cardinal, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, spoke of the mistakes he feels he made when he became the superior of his Jesuit province in Argentina at the “crazy” young age of 36. He talked about his vision of the church, and why he has chosen not to spend much time talking about abortion, gay marriage and contraception. He explained what he meant by the headline-grabbing remark he made about gay people: “Who am I to judge?” And he said that doubt is essential to finding God.        
— LAURIE GOODSTEIN        
Who is Jorge Mario Bergoglio? 
I am a sinner. This is the most accurate definition. It is not a figure of speech, a literary genre. I am a sinner.        
Why did you become a Jesuit, a member of the Society of Jesus? 
Three things in particular struck me about the Society: the missionary spirit, community and discipline. And this is strange, because I am a really, really undisciplined person. But their discipline, the way they manage their time — these things struck me so much.        
What did you learn in your early experience as superior of the Jesuit province in Argentina? 
My authoritarian and quick manner of making decisions led me to have serious problems and to be accused of being ultraconservative. I lived a time of great interior crisis when I was in Cordova. To be sure, I have never been like Blessed Imelda, but I have never been a right-winger. It was my authoritarian way of making decisions that created problems.        
What should the church say to divorced and remarried people, and homosexuals? 
In Buenos Aires I used to receive letters from homosexual persons who are “socially wounded” because they tell me that they feel like the church has always condemned them. But the church does not want to do this. During the return flight from Rio de Janeiro, I said that if a homosexual person is of good will and is in search of God, I am no one to judge. By saying this, I said what the catechism says. Religion has the right to express its opinion in the service of the people, but God in creation has set us free: it is not possible to interfere spiritually in the life of a person.        
A person once asked me, in a provocative manner, if I approved of homosexuality. I replied with another question: “Tell me: when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?” We must always consider the person.        
What kind of church do you dream of? 
We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods. This is not possible. I have not spoken much about these things, and I was reprimanded for that. But when we speak about these issues, we have to talk about them in a context. The teaching of the church, for that matter, is clear and I am a son of the church, but it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time.        
The dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent. The church’s pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently …        
We have to find a new balance; otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards, losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel. The proposal of the Gospel must be more simple, profound, radiant. It is from this proposition that the moral consequences then flow.        
I say this also thinking about the preaching and content of our preaching.        
What should be the role of the Vatican’s various departments (or congregations)? 
They are instruments of help. In some cases, however, when they are not functioning well, they run the risk of becoming institutions of censorship. It is amazing to see the denunciations for lack of orthodoxy that come to Rome. I think the cases should be investigated by the local bishops’ conferences, which can get valuable assistance from Rome. These cases, in fact, are much better dealt with locally. The Roman congregations are mediators; they are not middlemen or managers.        
What should be the role of women in the church? 
I am wary of a solution that can be reduced to a kind of “female machismo,” because a woman has a different makeup than a man. But what I hear about the role of women is often inspired by an ideology of machismo. Women are asking deep questions that must be addressed. The church cannot be herself without the woman and her role. The woman is essential for the church. Mary, a woman, is more important than the bishops. I say this because we must not confuse the function with the dignity. We must therefore investigate further the role of women in the church. We have to work harder to develop a profound theology of the woman. Only by making this step will it be possible to better reflect on their function within the church. The feminine genius is needed wherever we make important decisions. The challenge today is this: to think about the specific place of women also in those places where the authority of the church is exercised for various areas of the church.        
If encountering God is a journey, then we can make mistakes? 
If one has the answers to all the questions — that is the proof that God is not with him. It means that he is a false prophet using religion for himself. The great leaders of the people of God, like Moses, have always left room for doubt. You must leave room for the Lord, not for our certainties; we must be humble.        
… Our life is not given to us like an opera libretto, in which all is written down; but it means going, walking, doing, searching, seeing. … We must enter into the adventure of the quest for meeting God; we must let God search and encounter us.        
… If the Christian is a restorationist, a legalist, if he wants everything clear and safe, then he will find nothing. Tradition and memory of the past must help us to have the courage to open up new areas to God. Those who today always look for disciplinarian solutions, those who long for an exaggerated doctrinal “security,” those who stubbornly try to recover a past that no longer exists — they have a static and inward-directed view of things. In this way, faith becomes an ideology among other ideologies. I have a dogmatic certainty: God is in every person’s life. God is in everyone’s life. Even if the life of a person has been a disaster, even if it is destroyed by vices, drugs or anything else — God is in this person’s life. You can, you must try to seek God in every human life. Although the life of a person is a land full of thorns and weeds, there is always a space in which the good seed can grow. You have to trust God.        



 



"
Business,"










This interview with Alan Dabbiere, chairman of AirWatch, a mobile device management company, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant. 


Q. You’ve started or helped build a couple of companies. Is that in your family’s DNA? 
A. I didn’t grow up in an entrepreneurial family. I was heading to medical school, and I did four years of chemistry in college. My father got sick and passed away my senior year. I didn’t like the environment of being in a hospital. As a matter of fact, I was probably planning on being a doctor more for him than for me, because he wanted a doctor in the family. I ended up getting an M.B.A., and worked with a consulting firm for four years.        
But I found that as a consultant, you are often told where to be and when to be there. I liked the nonstop travel for a while, but I wanted a little more control over my life and more autonomy. I had met some developers, and we got together and decided to start a company.        
Q. What did you learn from that experience? 
A. After we started the company, they called a meeting. In the way we structured the company, I owned 50 percent — because I had the capital and I got the company up and running — and they jointly owned 50 percent. They said: “We don’t think that’s fair anymore. We’re going to divide it equally, and you’re going down to 20 percent.” I said, “I don’t think that’s what I was planning on.” I did everything I could to talk them out of that, but they were very resistant. I finally said, “Look, I’ve got a way that you can have 100 percent of the company.” I left, and I went out and found a new set of partners and did a complete restart. I set really clear expectations with my next set of partners.        
Q. And your next company was? 
A. Manhattan Associates. It took me about five years to get to 30 people, and then within three years, we were 800 people and we went public. I stayed with them until they were well over 1,000 people and then I decided wanted to do something new.        
Q. Now you’re the chairman of AirWatch. What have you learned about culture from running two big companies? 
A. Starting a company is a bit like watching a murder-mystery movie. The first time you’re just trying to figure out how it ends. The second time you know how it ends, and you’re actually focused on the hints that the director was giving you through the process. You’re much more focused on the style of the movie.        
Q. Can you elaborate?  
A. With Manhattan Associates, we were scaling so quickly and we just kept hiring people. We hired people who were a little bit too young. I found that it was easier for me to hire out of school and train the people I wanted, as opposed to the people who were more set in their ways. The problem is you can’t run 800 people with a bunch of very young employees. We had kids with one year of experience who were managing people with six months of experience. There was a little bit of internal chaos when you’re growing that quickly, because I’d never done this before.        
Q. How was your leadership style evolving? 
A. I made every mistake you could possibly make. I was extremely autocratic. One of the reasons we probably had a lot of young people is because I could tell young people what to do, and they wouldn’t question it. If you bring in more senior people and tell them how to do their job, they don’t like that very much. I wasn’t married, and I had nothing else in my life, and I didn’t have the view that anybody else had a life. Why would you, when you’re having this much fun building a company like this? It really wasn’t until after the I.P.O. that things started to slow down a little bit, and we became more accepting of different roles, different people and different ways of managing.        
Q. So, to use your metaphor, you’ve had a chance to watch the movie a second time in your current role. Tell me about that. 
A. We’ve grown from 100 people to 1,500 people in the past three years. You’ve got to build teams that are organized. You’ve got to have different layers of management and skill sets. You don’t just take a salesperson and make them a sales manager, because those are completely different skills. We still hire a lot of young people out of school. We do a lot of interviews, but we’re extremely selective. People want to be challenged in their interviews.        
Q. So let’s talk about hiring. How does the conversation go? 
A. We ask how people feel about mobile. Do they like it? How do they interact with their devices? We want people who are passionate about this. We ask them if they feel lucky. We want people to feel lucky, because the harder you work, the luckier you get. So people who work hard actually feel lucky.        
And I make the statement that I think there are three kinds of people in this world. With the first, you ask them to do something, and they can’t get it done. With the second type of person, if you tell them what to do, they’ll get the job done. There’s a third type of person — you point them in the right direction and they’ll figure it out. We need that third type of person.        
Q. What other questions do you ask? 
A. You ask them to tell stories. Give me situations where you’ve done something creative. Give me situations where there was a problem that you needed to solve. Give me a situation where you didn’t have the leadership telling you what to do, but you had to go fix a problem. And then you just let them go from there. By asking really open-ended questions, you get a good sense of not only how people answer questions, but also how they think.        
And I almost always ask somebody to take something that’s complicated and that they know really, really well and explain it to me. I don’t care what it is. Can they put it in plain language and communicate it in clear and crisp and complete terms? There’s just nothing more important than clear communications. Being able to take the complex and turn it into simple — that’s what we do for a living. It takes a lot of technology to create the illusion of simplicity.

"
Weekend,"







                            Several times in “Rush,” Ron Howard’s excitingly torqued movie set in the Formula One race world, the camera gets so close to a driver’s eye that you can see each trembling lash. It’s a startlingly beautiful but also naked image, partly because there’s no hiding for an actor when the camera gets that close. In moments like these, you’re no longer watching a performance with its layers of art and technique: you’ve crossed the border between fiction and documentary to go eye to eye with another person’s nervous system. Mr. Howard doesn’t just want you to crawl inside a Formula One racecar, he also wants you to crawl inside its driver’s head.        


                            Specifically, he wants to get inside those of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl), Formula One titans and rivals, who, in 1976, helped push the sport into mainstream consciousness. (Well, at least in much of the rest of the world: Formula One has long struggled in the United States.) In 1976, when both men were in their late 20s, they raced after each other while chasing the world championship over wet, dry and terrifyingly gnarly tracks. Tucked, very much alone, into open-wheel machines that could easily have become coffins, Hunt and Lauda cut corners and grazed death lap after lap — whooshing over racetracks, city streets and deceptively pastoral roads into the sort of sports legend that translates only occasionally into good cinema.        

                            Built for speed on and off the track, Hunt was the pretty one, a tall, blond, British playboy who transcended his middle-class background to become racing royalty, the King James of newspaper headlines. Born into a wealthy Austrian family, the shorter, slighter and darker Lauda was, by contrast, cruelly nicknamed the Rat because of his pronounced overbite. (The Beaver would have been a more apt handle.) Hunt partied hard — archival photographs inevitably show him bookended by women, his gaze nestled in their décolletage — while Lauda assumed the role of the frosty, teetotaling tactician. They were an ideally matched, telegenic, salable pair — the heartthrob and the master gearhead — whose differences in and out of their cars put a playful, at times anguished human face onto a sports story.        

                            It’s one that the screenwriter Peter Morgan strips down to its satisfying, straightforward core. There are all sorts of narratives that could be spun out of Formula One, including how lives were sacrificed for profit. (In 1994, Ayrton Senna became the last driver to die in a Grand Prix.) It’s hard to believe, though, that even a down-and-dirty exposé would be a fraction as entertaining as “Rush,” which distills the thrill of racing into a clash of personalities, one nail-biting face-off, a catastrophic accident and a wild comeback. Enzo Ferrari, the Ferrari founder (who was called the Saturn, or devourer of his children, because of the fatalities during his tenure), might have been more important to Formula One than any driver, but romances like “Rush” don’t belong to the owners: they belong to the workers, the grim ones and the smiling ones, the ones with the death wish and the ones with the gushers of Champagne.        

                            Shortly after the movie opens, Hunt is walking barefoot into a hospital, bleeding from the nose while still in his racing suit. He’s a ravishing mess, and his effect on the room, which goes immediately silent, is unmistakably erotic. “Hunt, James Hunt,” he announces, echoing a familiar line. Before long, a nurse is at once dressing his wound and undressing the rest of him, a seduction that’s as much about the audience’s pleasure as that of the characters on screen. Best known for playing the comic-book hero Thor, Mr. Hemsworth is prettier than the all-too-real man he plays in “Rush.” Yet this surplus of beauty works for the role because the actor, who holds the screen with the unconscious physical confidence of the truly lovely, looks like the star that James Hunt became.        

                            The scene of Hunt sauntering into a hospital also signals that, for all the machines and money, “Rush” is a human story about bodies, if ones almost always in furious motion. It’s also about work, about finding “a drive,” as they say in racing, and keeping it, even after machines and people spectacularly fail. Lauda, who’s seen buying his way into racing with loans (his family didn’t support his passion), isn’t a natural physical specimen or showman like Hunt. Yet one of the movie’s deepening pleasures is how, as the story slyly shifts from one man to the other, it peels back the arrogance encasing Lauda, who’s so abrasive that it’s hard not to root against him, even as Mr. Brühl’s dexterous, textured performance pulls you close.

London — The song arrives late in the new musical “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” but when that familiar lilting melody begins, audiences come alive as at no other point in the show. During one performance this summer, several people hummed softly while others smiled broadly as the mysterious chocolatier, Willy Wonka, stepped into his glass elevator and sang “Pure Imagination,” the immensely tuneful number from the 1971 film “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.”        


The show’s director, Sam Mendes, feared this would happen. He resisted including “Pure Imagination” at first, saying he already felt “haunted” by the performance of Gene Wilder as Wonka from the movie. He didn’t want his musical’s otherwise original score to be sized up against the most beloved song from the movie. 
But now it is “Pure Imagination” — more durable than an Everlasting Gobstopper — that is haunting the $20 million musical. The show may well end up being remembered as a cautionary tale for movie studios who want to make musicals out of films and books (in this case, by Roald Dahl) that are treasured by many.        
“It’s a song you can’t get out of your head,” said an audience member, David Reid of Inverness, Scotland, as he and his 12-year-old son, Matthew, stood outside the Drury Lane Theater after the show. “It’s quite hard to improve on that movie, isn’t it?”        
“Charlie,” the latest theatrical effort by Hollywood studios to cash in on movie properties, is facing an uphill climb toward a major goal of its producers at Warner Brothers: becoming a hit on Broadway. The world premiere opened here to sharply mixed reviews this summer, including some harsh ones — a hindrance to any future Broadway transfer, let alone eventual profitability here or in New York or from road and international productions that might follow.        
More damning than anything, some critics declared that the most resonant song in the musical was not one of the 18 original numbers by the Tony Award winners Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (“Hairspray”), but “Pure Imagination,” the only tune imported from the Wilder movie.        
While Mr. Mendes’s musical has much else that is new — a plot twist involving Wonka, played by the Tony winner Douglas Hodge (“La Cage aux Folles”), for instance, and an updating of Charlie and the other four children with golden tickets — the show nevertheless finds itself struggling to compete with a ghost.        
“I found it pretty difficult to un-remember Gene Wilder while I was working on this, but ideally people have to put aside the movie,” said Mr. Mendes, himself the Oscar-winning film director of “American Beauty,” and whose last picture was the James Bond blockbuster “Skyfall.”        
“Look, we have seen visual renditions of worlds on film that you are never going to get in theater — the yellow brick road will only go to the back wall of the theater, and Wonka’s river of chocolate can never be matched onstage,” Mr. Mendes added. “You have to find magical solutions to theatrical challenges, and hope that the audiences are open to them.”        
No one is hoping more than the show’s lead producers from Warner Brothers, Mark Kaufman and Raymond Wu, who took over the theatrical division in 2011 as part of a shake-up after its Broadway musical flops “Baby It’s You” and “Lestat.” The two men were bullish during a recent interview, using their own superlatives to describe the London production of “Charlie,” but they also said that the musical would be retooled for Broadway.        
A New York transfer has not been announced; while the 2014-15 theater season is thought to be the target, the two men declined to say when it would happen. (Another musical based on a Dahl book, “Matilda,” is now running in London and on Broadway; it has had strong reviews and solid ticket sales in both markets. The “Charlie” producers said they were confident that “Matilda” would not swamp them.)        
“Every show and everyone deserves a second chance,” Mr. Kaufman said. “Plenty of shows get reviews that aren’t favorable the first time out. Our word of mouth is good, and we’re playing at 95 percent capacity, which is a very good sign.”        
Several Broadway producers who have come here to see “Charlie” were lukewarm about its script and score and said they would not want to invest in any Broadway transfer of the show. (The producers would only disclose their reservations anonymously, for fear of offending the artists involved.) None had any easy solutions to the show’s flaws, but posited two ideas. Lacking excellent reviews, the show needs to build into a box office sensation to justify a transfer to New York. And the producers could add more popular tunes from the Wilder film, like “The Candy Man,” or the “Oompa Loompa” songs that accompany the little orange-skinned men who work in the factory.        
But the Warner Brothers executives, who have heard these suggestions, won’t go there.

The playwright and performance artist Ain Gordon haunts the margins of history. Main events featuring famous people, the kind recorded with unblinking authority in encyclopedia entries, have never been his primary interest. In works like “In This Place ...” and “A Disaster Begins,” Mr. Gordon conjures the sort of distant lives that don’t make it into textbooks, processed into oblivion by what he calls history’s “ruthless editing machine.”        


With “Not What Happened,” opening on Wednesday as part of the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Mr. Gordon has created a double portrait of a woman who lived inconspicuously in early 19th-century Vermont and the contemporary historical re-enactor who tries to replicate that woman’s past in the present. As the production’s title suggests, complete retrospective knowledge is not easily come by. The adventurous Ken Rus Schmoll directs a production that features images by the photographer Forrest Holzapfel, with Birgit Huppuch and Kim Martin-Cotten as alter egos separated by centuries.

Travel,"










The major news out of Iceland in recent years has not been good. First a banking collapse crippled the economy in 2008, and then a year and a half later, the volcanic eruption at Eyjafjallajokull halted air travel across the Atlantic and in Europe, frustrating millions. But signs of an upswing — economic and otherwise — can be spotted in Reykjavik, where this year the capital’s impressive new concert hall won the prestigious Mies van der Rohe Award, the European Union’s top prize for contemporary architecture. In other parts of town, new restaurants are embracing fresh local fare, and the bacchanalian night life is thumping with a crop of new bars and clubs. This winter has been predicted to be a particularly favorable time to observe the aurora borealis dancing across the night sky, but already Reykjavik is shining.        


FRIDAY 
3:30 p.m.1. Hallowed Halls 
To get your bearings, take the elevator to the top of the austere Hallgrimskirkja, an imposing pale gray church whose distinctive stepped-slope facade frames a tower (admission, 700 kronur, or about $6 at 118 kronur to the dollar) from which a bird’s-eye view of the city’s colorful rooftops and compact downtown awaits. Then return to sea level to marvel at the city’s newest architectural landmark: the Harpa concert hall, unveiled in May 2011, is a dazzling geometric structure that sits like a jewel on the waterfront. Home to Iceland’s symphony orchestra and opera, Harpa is well worth a visit even if only to gaze through the honeycomb-like glass facade, designed in collaboration with the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson.        
5:30 p.m.2. Records and Reels 
A modest two-story house fronted with corrugated metal is where you’ll find 12 Tonar, a small record store, listening room and gathering place for local musicians. The pocket-size shop often hosts live performances on Friday afternoons, with bands squeezed between bins and shelves in a setup reminiscent of NPR’s Tiny Desk concerts. After the show, head downstairs to listen to any album from the ever-changing selection, which is as varied as the influences that fuel Iceland’s experimental music scene. Prefer reels to records? Then stroll over to the cozy Bio Paradis, an independent four-screen cinema that opened in 2010 showing new movies, art-house flicks and Icelandic films (often with English subtitles), like the moving Sigur Ros documentary “Heima” about the band’s 2006 series of free, unannounced concerts around Iceland.        
8 p.m.3. Icelandic Tapas 
Dine on a parade of creative small plates at Forrettabarinn, a new restaurant near the harbor that hums with convivial chatter. Glowing pendant lamps and eclectic artworks brighten the industrial interior, where groups of friends gather around long wooden tables to graze on locally sourced hot smoked salmon and plump blue mussels. A highlight of a recent meal was a plate of buttery cod with crispy pork belly, chunks of chorizo and creamed parsnips (1,890 kronur), which was bested only by dessert: a parfait of skyr — an Icelandic yogurt-like dairy product — layered with cream and blueberries (1,390 kronur).        
10 p.m.4. Civilized Sips 
Until 1989, most beers were banned in Iceland under an old prohibition law, so when it comes to beer drinking (and brewing), the country has a lot of catching up to do. Even today, craft brewing is just starting to catch on, which means it’s feasible to sample beers from most of the domestic craft breweries in a single night. Start at the year-old Kaldi Bar, where there are several cozy nooks in which to sip a pint of caramel-tinged Kaldi dark. Then pull up a stool at MicroBar, an unassuming new pub hidden behind the lobby of the City Center Hotel, which has eight taps dedicated to Icelandic craft brews like Gaedingur Brugghus’s hoppy IPA; a flight to taste all eight costs 3,500 kronur.        
SATURDAY 
8 a.m.5. Waterfront Walk 
Wake up with a walk along the waterfront path that winds northwest out of the city into the residential Seltjarnarnes area and toward the lighthouse on Grotta Island. With uninterrupted views of the majestic Esja mountain range across the water, it’s an enjoyable two-mile trek to the tip of the peninsula. If you can’t continue onto Grotta — it’s reachable by foot only during low tide when a rocky, seaweed-strewn isthmus emerges — consider dipping your toes in the geothermal footbath (actually a sculpture by Olof Nordal called “Kvika”) nestled among the rocks nearby.        
 11:30 a.m.6. Waffles and Art

It was late August in Martha’s Vineyard, a bright, sunny day perfect for a farmers’ market. I arrived at 9 a.m. with Chris Fischer — chef, farmer, guy who knows everyone. Mr. Fischer, who grew up on a farm here and has had a job since he was 9, looks as if he grew up on a farm here and has had a job since he was 9. His dark, weathered skin, wrinkly eyes, graying beard and cracked, calloused hands belie a mere 33 years.        


Mr. Fischer, a 12th-generation Islander, was here to shop for the evening’s menu at Beach Plum Inn and Restaurant, where he took over the kitchen four months ago and where, as you may have heard, the Obamas recently had a date night (“lobster for him, mussels for her,” according to Mr. Fischer). The farmers’ market here in West Tisbury is small but serves two entirely different needs. The first is for vacationers: bouquets of zinnias, alpaca sweaters, gluten-free muffins, fresh ears of corn to throw on the rental house grill.        
Then there’s the market that only the farmers themselves see. In this one, the players know who has the best field greens or who had a rough year. They pay each other in trade as often as in cash. There’s camaraderie and history and real friendship among them.        
At the Whippoorwill Farm stand, Mr. Fischer grabbed more beets than any civilian could possibly need. Next, he hauled an armful of basil plants from a man whose hair could only be described as Bozo the Clown Goes Brunette. At the Tea Lane Farm stand, we stopped to inspect buckets of delicate, papery flowers being organized by a young, cherubic-looking woman. And finally, I was introduced to a farmer named Bob, who handed Mr. Fischer two bags of potatoes.        
“Arrgh, sorry,” Bob said. “I didn’t bring any today.”        
“Bob makes his own hooch,” Mr. Fischer explained. “He usually brings me a bottle.”        
Scratch the surface of any vacation town and you’ll find the locals. But on Martha’s Vineyard, which has long been a popular getaway for Northeasterners (it’s only two and a half hours from Boston by car and ferry), local culture is particularly storied: farmers, cheesemakers, coffee roasters and fishermen who have established an ad hoc New England utopia. They know one another intimately, date one another occasionally, work the land, rarely go to the beach and keep to the area known as Up Island.        
This pocket of Martha’s Vineyard — actually the western side of the island — revolves around Chilmark and Menemsha. It’s where resorts give way to pastures and farmland and wildlife. It’s where you find centuries-old farms run by 28-year-olds, as well as lithe women, whom you might mistake for models or actresses in New York or Los Angeles, picking kale on bucolic 10-acre plots. It’s a bohemia that’s both real and not: on one hand, there are dairy farms and free-roaming turkeys and people who barter vegetables; on the other, Bill Clinton plays golf nearby and Seth Meyers just had his wedding here. (Mr. Fischer catered, Tea Lane Farm did the flowers, and so on.)        
And Mr. Fischer, who runs the famed Beetlebung Farm and who recently returned to Martha’s Vineyard to helm Beach Plum (in my opinion, the best restaurant the island has ever laid claim to) is at its center. But here’s the trick: Mr. Fischer’s insider world — the farms, the food, the storybook beauty — is wide open to the public. The farms have unmanned stands on their driveways where fresh produce is sold. (Just leave your money in the cash box; it’s the honor system.) At Beetlebung Farm, you can actually cut your own flowers. Other spots, like Tea Lane Farm and North Tabor Farm, are not technically open to the public, but the proprietors are usually happy to let you meet the animals, especially this time of year, when the tourists drift back home and the island empties out.        
Mr. Fischer’s approach to food comes from his father, Albert. A former commercial fisherman, Albert (imagine an only slightly trimmer Wilford Brimley) taught his children to hunt, fish, forage and farm, all before they hit puberty. “We ate off the land,” Albert said. “Living on this island, you eat well.” And then, in a phrase that could be printed on every Beach Plum menu, he added: “Food should be simple and fresh and you should be able to see your ingredients.”

Tom DeLay was the very symbol of Congressional power and, in the view of his detractors, excess. His political career collapsed in 2005 when Mr. DeLay, a Texas Republican who was the House majority leader, was indicted on money-laundering charges that resulted in a three-year prison sentence.        


But Mr. DeLay’s long and colorful life took another turn on Thursday as a Texas appeals court threw out the November 2010 verdict, ruling that what he was convicted of — laundering corporate contributions to divert money to elect Republicans to the State Legislature — did not violate any state laws.        
Mr. DeLay, as it turned out, was in Washington at a luncheon with his former Republican colleagues when the decision was announced. The former congressman, known as the Hammer for a political style that embraced hard-edge political tactics and a relationship with Washington lobbyists that invited scrutiny from prosecutors, was nothing short of jubilant, praising God and belittling Democrats and prosecutors for making such an effort to go after him.        
“I just thank the Lord for carrying me through all of this,” Mr. DeLay told reporters as he left a meeting of the Texas Republican delegation. “It really drove my detractors crazy because I had the joy of Jesus in me, and they didn’t understand it.”        
The decision by the Third Court of Appeals, which voted 2 to 1 on party lines, was the latest time that a high-profile prosecution of an elected official invoking unusual legal theories has been stymied by an appeals court or stumbled in the legal process. Others who avoided convictions or had them overturned include former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina and former Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska.        
From the start, many Republicans had denounced this prosecution as politically motivated overreach.        
Still, given the long list of ethical questions that have clouded Mr. DeLay’s career — the former congressman said he had spent nearly $12 million on legal bills, fending off everything from the Congressional ethics committee to the Department of Justice — the decision appears to fall short of a complete ethical cleansing.        
When he stepped down as majority leader in 2005, and later decided not to seek re-election from his district in Sugarland, Mr. DeLay, now 66, faced not only the indictment in Texas but also an investigation by the Department of Justice into his relationship with Jack Abramoff, a lobbyist at the heart of an ethics investigation.        
The Justice Department never brought charges against Mr. DeLay for, among other things, accepting gifts from Mr. Abramoff like a 10-day golf trip to Scotland and England for Mr. DeLay, his wife and some staff members.        
Mr. DeLay’s lawyer, Brian W. Wice, said that the investigations had “ruined his life in large part,” but that Mr. DeLay viewed the decision as a vindication — a chance to restart his career.        
“Now that this sword of Damocles has been removed, I would think he could do almost anything he wanted to do,” he said.        
Mr. DeLay has been free on a $10,000 bond. He has been anything but low profile, delivering speeches, offering consulting advice, writing a blog and — in a career turn that might have eclipsed his work in Washington — appearing on “Dancing With the Stars” while wearing a vest with leopard trim.        
“They never got rid of me,” Mr. DeLay said. “You may see my shadow or footprints around over the last seven years. I’ve been active.”        
Mr. DeLay was convicted with two associates of funneling $190,000 in corporate contributions through the Republican National Committee to Republicans running for the State Legislature in 2002. The election had national implications: Mr. DeLay was looking to lock in Republican control of the Legislature as it prepared to redraw Congressional district lines.        
And after that election, Republicans in Texas pushed through a redistricting plan that markedly changed the playing field in favor of Republicans, strengthening Mr. DeLay’s control in Washington.        
This was the first time that prosecutors in Texas had attempted to use a money-laundering statute against a politician charged with trying to circumvent the state ban on corporate contributions that has been in place since 2003. Mr. DeLay never denied he engaged in the practices described in the indictment, but said they were common and legally accepted campaign practices.        
In its decision, the court flatly rejected the case brought against him.        
“The evidence was legally insufficient to support DeLay’s convictions,” Justice Melissa Goodwin wrote for the majority. “The fundamental problem with the state’s case was its failure to prove proceeds of criminal activity.”        
The Travis County district attorney’s office said it was considering whether to appeal to the full Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. “We are concerned and disappointed that two judges substituted their assessment of the facts for that of 12 jurors who personally heard the testimony of over 40 witnesses over the course of several weeks and found that the evidence was sufficient and proved DeLay’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” the office said.        
Mr. Wice, who described himself as a close friend and “a consigliere” to Mr. DeLay — “I’ve been doing this for 30 years and you want to win them all, but I never wanted to win one more than this one” — said that he did not expect the appeals court to overturn the decision, and that he thought it unlikely they would even take it up.        
“I’ve clerked at that court, I’ve followed it since the Truman administration,” he said. “I am confident that they are not going to look at the case. You didn’t need to be a legal genius to see that the money-laundering statute doesn’t apply here.”        
As he talked to reporters, Mr. DeLay traced his problems back to 1995, when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee began filing ethics charges against him.        
“I have raised and spent on legal fees over that period over $12 million,” he said. “But that’s what they wanted to do, they wanted to destroy me.”

MILAN — The painted faces stared down from the walls, in ecstasy, anger, sadness — all women, of course, for these were murals by artists from Jeanne Detallante’s “Beauty Masks” to Gabriel Specter’s “Colourful Women.” And this was a show by Miuccia Prada.        


“I wanted to do such beautiful dresses, but I wanted to express the fight — that had to be very visible,” said Ms. Prada backstage. “I struggled to do it. I personally love it. And I tried to make it interesting — at least from my point of view.”        
Interesting the dresses were: colorful and extraordinary, illuminated not just by the bold faces printed digitally over the lower body of a wool or fur coat, but also smothered in sequins, especially rhinestone brassieres built in at the bosoms.        
With the vivid green, red, yellow and blue colors; the knee-high, sporty leg warmers; and sometimes colored feathers in the hair, the effect was tribal. But there was also an unexpected feeling of the 1980s and those Vivienne Westwood external bras inspired by African women.        
But Ms. Prada makes everything her own. Instead of the ugly aesthetic for which she is famed, these clothes were weirdly beautiful. The vast heads, on the clothes or handbags, seemed to shout the story of this current decade: “Look at me.” “It’s all about me.”        
No other designer captures quite so forcefully in fashion the current female mind.

The name Myllokunmingia may not ring a bell, but it is worth knowing. This 520-million-year-old creature was the size of a guppy, with a tiny swordfish-like fin running high over its back. The fossils it has left behind preserve traces of a skull.        


Humans have a skull, too. This and a number of other traits we share with Myllokunmingia reveal it to be one of the oldest, most primitive vertebrates yet found. It is, in other words, a hint of where we came from.        
Myllokunmingia emerged during one of the most important phases in the history of life, an evolutionary boom known as the Cambrian explosion (named for the geological period when it took place). Over the course of about 20 million years, the oldest known fossils of most of the major groups of living animals appear, revealing a rapid diversification of life that led directly to humans.        
“It’s rapid in geological terms, but it’s probably not rapid to anyone who’s not a geologist,” said Paul Smith, the director of the Oxford Museum of Natural History.        
By some estimates, the first animals evolved about 750 million years ago. But it’s not until around 520 million years ago that many major groups of living animals left behind their first fossils. For decades, scientists have searched for the trigger that set in motion this riot of diversity in the animal kingdom.        
Recently, Dr. Smith and his colleague David Harper of the University of Durham took a look at the hypotheses that have been offered about what caused the Cambrian explosion. “It became apparent just how many hypotheses there were out there,” Dr. Harper said. “Thirty-plus over the past 10 years.”        
The scientists found that many of those explanations had boiled the cause down to just one trigger. Geologists suggested geological causes. Ecologists proposed ecological ones. Many of those ideas have merit, Dr. Smith and Dr. Harper argue in a commentary in this week’s Science, but it’s a mistake to search for a single cause. They propose that a tangled web of factors and feedbacks were responsible for evolution’s big bang.        
Long before the Cambrian explosion, Dr. Smith and Dr. Harper argue, one lineage of animals had already evolved the genetic capacity for spectacular diversity. Known as the bilaterians, they probably looked at first like little crawling worms. They shared the Precambrian oceans with other animals, like sponges and jellyfish. During the Cambrian explosion, relatively modest changes to their genes gave rise to a spectacular range of bodies.        
But those genes evolved in bilaterians tens of millions of years before the Cambrian explosion put them to the test, notes Dr. Smith. “They had the capacity,” he said, “but it hadn’t been expressed yet.”        
It took a global flood to tap that capacity, Dr. Smith and Dr. Harper propose. They base their proposal on a study published last year by Shanan Peters of the University of Wisconsin and Robert Gaines of Pomona College. They offered evidence that the Cambrian Explosion was preceded by a rise in sea level that submerged vast swaths of land, eroding the drowned rocks.        
“There’s a big kick that correlates with the sea level rise,” Dr. Smith said of the fossil record. He and Dr. Harper propose that this kick happened thanks to the new habitats created by the sea level rise. These shallow coastal habitats were bathed in sunlight and nourished with eroding nutrients like phosphates. Animals colonized these new fertile habitats, Dr. Smith and Dr. Harper argue, and evolved to take up new ecological niches.        
But these great floods also poisoned the ocean. The erosion of the coastlines released calcium, which can be toxic to cells. In order to survive, animals had to evolve ways to rid themselves of the poison. One solution may have been to pack the calcium into crystals, which eventually evolved into shells, bones, and other hard tissues. Dr. Smith doesn’t think it’s a coincidence that several different lineages of bilaterians evolved hard tissues during the Cambrian explosion, and not sooner.        
These shells and other hard tissues sped up animal evolution even more. Predators could grow hard claws and jaws for killing prey, and their prey could evolve hard shells and spines to defend themselves. Animals became locked in an evolutionary arms race.        
This new ecological food web grew even more complex. Bigger predators evolved that could eat smaller predators. Meanwhile, some bilaterians burrowed into the sea floor for the first time, allowing oxygen-rich seawater to flow into the sediment. Those first burrowers profoundly transformed the world’s oceans, creating yet another habitat that other oxygen-breathing animals could also invade. “That drives the diversification onward,” said Dr. Smith.        
Kevin Peterson, a biologist at Dartmouth, praised Dr. Smith and Dr. Harper for pointing to the right way to study the Cambrian explosion. “We are long past identifying single triggers for the event,” he said. Dr. Peters agreed that taking a holistic view of the Cambrian explosion would lead to a better understanding of it. “It’ll be a fun next decade,” he predicted.        
But Philip Donoghue of the University of Bristol does not think the links Dr. Smith and Dr. Harper use in their hypothesis are tight enough yet. Questions still remain, for example, about how long vertebrates and other animals groups already existed before they left behind fossils like Myllokunmingia. If animals diversified earlier, then scientists will need to look at earlier causes.        
“Timing,” said Dr. Donoghue, “is everything.”

In findings that are as scientifically significant as they are crushing to the popular imagination, NASA reported Thursday that its Mars rover, Curiosity, has deflated hopes that life could be thriving on Mars today.        


The conclusion, published in the journal Science, comes from the fact that Curiosity has been looking for methane, a gas that is considered a possible calling card of microbes, and has so far found none of it. While the absence of methane does not rule out the possibility of present-day life on Mars — there are plenty of microbes, on Earth at least, that do not produce methane — it does return the idea to the realm of pure speculation without any hopeful data to back it up.        
The history of human fascination with the possibility of life on Mars is rich, encompassing myriad works of science fiction, Percival Lowell’s quixotic efforts to map what turned out to be imaginary canals, Orson Welles’s panic-inducing 1938 “War of the Worlds” radio play, and of course Bugs Bunny’s nemesis, Marvin the Martian. 
But Marvin apparently did not emit enough methane for Curiosity’s sensitive instruments to find him.        
“You don’t have direct evidence that there is microbial process going on,” said Sushil K. Atreya, a professor of atmospheric and space science at the University of Michigan and a member of the science team.        
But NASA scientists are going strictly by their data, and they are leery about drawing broader implications to the question once posed by David Bowie, “Is there life on Mars?” John P. Grotzinger, the project scientist for the Curiosity mission, would go only so far as to say that the lack of this gas “does diminish” the possibility of methane-exhaling creatures going about their business on Mars.        
“It would have been great if we got methane,” Dr. Atreya said. “It just isn’t there.”        
Curiosity, which has been trundling across the planet for a little over a year, made measurements from Martian spring to late summer, coming up empty for methane.        
Scientists have long thought that Mars, warm and wet in its early years, could have been hospitable for life, and the new findings do not mean that it was not. But that was about three and a half billion years ago. Methane molecules break apart over a few centuries — victims of the Sun’s ultraviolet light and of chemical reactions in the atmosphere — so any methane in the air from primordial times would have disappeared long ago.        
That is why reports of huge plumes of methane rising over Mars in 2003 fueled fresh hopes for Martian microbes. Those findings, based on data from telescopes on Earth and a spacecraft orbiting Mars, set off a surge of speculation and scientific interest.        
On Earth, most of the methane comes from micro-organisms known as methanogens, but the gas is also produced without living organisms, in hydrothermal vents. Either possibility would be a surprising result for Mars.        
After the 2003 methane readings, “a lot people got excited and started working on it,” said Christopher R. Webster of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and the lead author of the paper in Science. “It was a very important result, because of the magnitude of methane.” The fresh data from Curiosity brings the earlier claims into question.        
Not everyone is daunted. Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society, a nonprofit group dedicated to the planet’s exploration and settlement, said he was still convinced that Martian life was waiting to be discovered in underground aquifers.        
“If it had found methane, that would have been killer,” Dr. Zubrin said, referring to Curiosity. “Yes, it’s disappointing in that we didn’t get a pony for Christmas. But it doesn’t mean there aren’t ponies out there.”        
One of the scientists who found the methane plumes in 2003, Michael J. Mumma, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said in an interview this week he was certain that his earlier measurements were still valid. He said he now believed that methane on Mars was episodic — released in large plumes and then quickly destroyed. He suggested, half-jokingly, that there could be huge colonies of methane-eating microbes on Mars that eliminated the gas from the air.        
Dr. Mumma acknowledged that he could not identify any phenomena that would explain why methane plumes spurted out that year but not more recently, or how methane could be destroyed much more quickly on Mars than on Earth.        
“Mars may not be operating the same way,” he said. “It’s a puzzle.”

“In a way you have to forgive people of a certain age,” the writer David Sedaris said recently. “Like when you watch the movie ‘Into the Wild.’ There were times when I just wanted to take that kid and shake him, but then I thought, he’s 20. That’s what 20-year-olds do, and you just have to forgive him that.”        


In 1997, Mr. Sedaris recalled his own youthful hubris in “C.O.G.,” an essay in his collection “Naked,” in which he describes a post-collegiate, Steinbeck-inspired pilgrimage to the Hood River Valley in Oregon to yank apples off trees and learn a little something about fortitude. It’s a smart, drolly told coming-of-age story, both mocking and indulgent of its narrator’s unearned righteousness — of all the humiliations that accompany self-discovery.        
With hopes of acquiring the film rights to “C.O.G.,” the writer and director Kyle Patrick Alvarez attended one of Mr. Sedaris’s readings, stood in line to meet him, and then handed over a DVD of his first film, “Easier With Practice.”        
“I just put it in my bag,” Mr. Sedaris said. “Then I finished my tour, and got back to England, and thought ‘Oh, right, this.’ To tell you the truth, I get a lot of things like that. But I thought, well, I’ll give it a try. And I just really, really liked it. I thought it was such a unique and strangely beautiful little movie.”        
He eventually said yes to Mr. Alvarez. “C.O.G.,” which was released on Friday by Screen Media and Focus World, is the first film adaptation of his work. (Mr. Alvarez wrote the script.) “I didn’t at any moment think, ‘Am I saying yes to the wrong person?' ” Mr. Sedaris said.        
And when it comes to movies, he knows a thing or two: There were stretches, he said, when he went to see films as often as three times a week, and repeat viewings — sometimes dozens — were not uncommon. On the phone from his home in England, Mr. Sedaris spoke about some of the films he’s watched the most.        
“The only thing I ever walked out of was ‘Dr. Doolittle’ with Eddie Murphy,” he said. “It’s remarkable what I’ll sit through — it really is.”

The article also misidentified the distributor of “C.O.G.,” a new film based on an essay by Mr. Sedaris. It is being released by Screen Media and Focus World, not by Forty Second Productions/Rhino Films. And the article omitted part of the name of the setting for “C.O.G.” It is the Hood River Valley, in Oregon — not the Hood Valley.

MILAN — High-rise buildings in Milan, their metallic frames and glass windows winking with the September sun, have brought a new futuristic feeling to this city.        


The Porta Nuova Business District was not just home this week to a financial initiative by the Condé Nast group to support artistic Italian students. It has also been a fresh venue for forward-looking designers.        
Across the spectrum of the Italian spring/summer 2014 season is a yearning for modernity. However deep the heritage of a brand, leading designers are looking for the future, not the past, in style and technique.        
The main message from these early shows is: let there be light.        
That was the story at Fendi, where backstage Silvia Venturini Fendi announced “light” was an inspiration, before taking a joint bow with Karl Lagerfeld, in his 48th year at the helm of the brand.        
The show started with a gust of lightness: dresses in red organza, the skirts blowing out. The same material would appear later with cutouts of sheared mink, adding to the collection’s graphic, modern feel.        
For all its ethereal effect, the show was also rich in the famous Fendi furs, delicately used, as light as feathers, teased into animal-shaped bags, dangling as earrings below the models’ Japanese square-cut hair and as fur rings embedded with crystal. These accessories were from the newest family fashion recruit: the jeweler Delfina Delettrez Fendi.        
The recent trajectory of Fendi has been to a streamlined modernity and Mr. Lagerfeld achieved that by using the exceptional work of the couture fur ateliers. With a new store opening this week on Via Montenapoleone, and an exhibition in a historic cinema of Fendi fur in film, the brand is on a roll.        
MaxMara has always been a no-nonsense brand with a focus on coats, but there was something almost monkish about the ultra-plain, finely cut outerwear over midcalf dresses. Both were in pallid, neutral colors, although enriched with texture. This parade of plainness, cover-up poncho coats included, went on to a fault, until there was an injection of the same look in vivid colors: fuchsia, purple, orange and red.        
MaxMara does a real service to women making such clean, clear well-cut clothes. But an exploration of more subtle colors like terra cotta, blush pink and rain-washed sky blue would have given a tinge of glamour.        
Ennio Capasa brought his Costume National women’s collection back from Paris to his native Italy. And it was to what the designer called “a new Milan”: the concrete basement of a soaring glass and steel skyscraper.        
The switch of showplace and space inspired Mr. Capasa to take a fresh look at deconstruction and reassembly.        
So the collection had sharp tailoring and high-tech materials mixed with craft: tunics set at an angle; tailoring, apparently in woven linen, contrasting with a silvered finish suited to the skeleton of the hyper-modern building.        
All the current minimalism in Milan has a hint of Céline today and of Helmut Lang from the past. But taking a modern and streamlined route is an important move for designers in this city.        
To see the yin and yang in Milanese design, there was Alberta Ferretti, turning to that perennial gift of summer: flowers. But her floral patterns had a touch of folklore, as though peasant girls had cross-stitched embroidery on white cotton.        
“The south of Italy meets South America,” said Ms. Ferretti backstage to explain the hot orange, bougainvillea pink and ocean blue that punctuated the collection.        
The effect was pretty and girlish, with dresses that will attract loyal clients who want to look feminine rather than feminist. But like those folkloric dances for the tourists, this vision of local culture went on too long.        
With a galaxy of explosions as a backdrop and blownup images of nature on the perky summer clothes, the Just Cavalli range was rich in digital pattern. The concept of animal skins with vegetable and floral patterns, if not new, made a fine splash of color and print.        
But why did Roberto Cavalli have to communicate this message by “sexting,” the word for those suggestive images sent via smartphones across cyberspace?        
Mr. Cavalli’s sexy message was clear from the first visible bra, albeit with pretty prints, that filled an open-front outfit. The theme went on with cut-away curves on a summer dress, revealing flesh at the side; cropped tops baring the midriff, and many more takes on the visible brassiere.        
The Just Cavalli message seemed to be: welcome to the world of sea, sand and yachts. And why not? But, apart from some patterned pants and a few narrow-strap dresses, these outfits seemed too hot to handle in the workplace.        
With shoes so often center stage at the current shows, the shoe brand Hogan has wanted to identify its clothing range. The total look, as envisaged by über-stylist Katie Grand, was more tailored than usual and the feet of the models, lounging in chairs, even had high-heeled pumps to compete with chunky boots.        
The trim leather jackets were an inspiration from the past.        
“I thought of a leather jacket my father loaned me that I used to wear in the 1970s. I took away the zipper and replaced it with buttons,” said Ms. Grand, who always makes anything historic look immediately modern.

Weekend,"










The Miser likes to quip that his appreciation of high culture stems from a more prosaic youthful pursuit: hours spent playing Dungeons & Dragons. Among the many worlds a player could compete in, this player was invariably drawn into realms replete with castles, knights, wizards and damsels.        


A savvy father directed the fledgling Miser to important source material — Thomas Malory’s “Morte d’Arthur” — and from there one could navigate the channels that chivalric lore cut through modern Western culture, from Wagner’s “Parsifal” and Eliot’s “Waste Land” to Georges Rouault’s “Old King.”        
“The Middle Ages on Film: Knights of the Roundtable,” a 10-day series at Anthology Film Archives, shows how some of our greatest film directors have mined that legacy as well.        
Friday kicks off at 6:45 p.m. with “Excalibur,” John Boorman’s 1981 take on the Arthur legend, featuring the future stars Liam Neeson, Helen Mirren, Patrick Stewart and Gabriel Byrne, followed at 9:30 by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones’s endlessly enjoyable deconstruction from 1975, “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.”        
On Saturday a pair of European films, “The Knight” (1980) by Lech Majewski, at 4:15 p.m., and Eric Rohmer’s “Perceval” (1978) at 6:15, offer artier takes on the quest narrative, and at 9, George Romero’s “Knightriders” (1981) improbably reimagines the Round Table as a Pennsylvania motorcycle gang, starring Ed Harris.        
On Sunday at 5:30 p.m., Akira Kurosawa’s 1954 masterpiece, “Seven Samurai,” depicts Japan’s parallel chivalric tradition, and at 9:30 Tay Garnett’s “Black Knight,” also from 1954 and starring Alan Ladd, brings us back to Camelot.        
Tickets are $10, and $8 for students and those over 65 or under 12, and are available at the Anthology Film Archives box office 30 minutes before screenings.        
(32 Second Avenue, at Second Street; 212-505-5181; anthologyfilmarchives.org.) 
A MEDIEVAL ‘REMIX’ 
The Arthurian apple apparently doesn’t fall far from the tree, as the Miser now finds himself living with a pair of young squires catching feudal fever. Naturally, we’ve spent time at the Cloisters, where, among the bombastic tapestries and solemn sarcophagi, the airy courtyards and formal gardens, one can almost forget the less-than-romantic urban surroundings.        
This weekend, while the kids go about “storming the castle,” you can take advantage of a more contemporary treat. The museum is presenting an installation by the sound artist Janet Cardiff, whose “40 Part Motet” is described as a “remix” of a 16th-century composition by Thomas Tallis, distributed across 40 speakers.        
As at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the recommended admission at the Cloisters, a branch of the Met, is $25 for adults, and includes entry to both museums for the day.        
(Friday, Saturday and Sunday, through Dec. 8, 10 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Inwood; 212-923-3700; metmuseum.org.)

Marshawn Lynch offered fantasy owners a valuable early lesson in Week 2.        


Despite facing the dreaded San Francisco 49ers run defense, Lynch scored three touchdowns (two rushing), rewarding owners who were brave enough to stick with him.        
It was a good reminder that sometimes fantasy owners can overthink the matchup and end up benching a player they drafted in the first round.        
In general, we preach that you should start the team you drafted, especially in the first few weeks of the season, and that players who have unfavorable matchups should not be benched if they are of a certain caliber.        
Lynch owners have it easy this week as he is up against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He is among our favorable matchup picks for Week 3.        
If you have a tough lineup question for Week 3, you can ask us on Twitter. Follow us at @5thDownFantasy. 
Favorable Matchups 
Quarterback 
Tony Romo (DAL) vs. St. Louis — The Rams secondary is off to a poor start, allowing an average of 350 yards passing and four total touchdowns through the first two games.        
 Russell Wilson (SEA) vs. Jacksonville – The Jaguars have allowed just 15 fantasy points per game to the position through the first two weeks, but we are not buying that they have improved much considering they faced Alex Smith and Terrelle Pryor.        
Matthew Stafford (DET) vs. Washington – The Redskins’ problematic secondary has been ransacked for 72 fantasy points this season, which is tops in the league. Stafford is a must-start top five quarterback in Week 3.        
Ryan Tannehill (MIA) vs. Atlanta — The Dolphins appear to have finally figured out a way to deploy their pricey new receiver, Mike Wallace (9 rec. 115 yds, WK 2), and Tannehill is starting to show a nice rapport with tight end Charles Clay. A meeting with the Falcons’ banged-up defense is on deck.        
Alex Smith (KC) vs. Philadelphia — Smith gets a foul Eagles secondary that made Philip Rivers (419 yards, 76.7 percent completion rate, 3 TDs) look like Aaron Rodgers last week. But Smith is still the check down king, ranking 30th in the league in yards per pass attempt (5.66), which keeps his upside grounded in mid-QB2 territory for Week 3.        
Running Back  
 Reggie Bush and Joique Bell (DET) vs. Washington – Bush’s availability for Sunday is up in the air, but if you handcuffed him with Bell you will be fine. Whoever gets the start should have a field day against a terrible Redskins run defense that made the mediocre James Starks (158 total yards, 1 TD) one of the most popular waiver wire adds this week.        
Marshawn Lynch (SEA) vs. Jacksonville – You may have benched Lynch against the dominant 49ers defense, only to be burned when he scored three touchdowns, but he should be considered a top two fantasy running back this week in a dream matchup with the Jaguars’ 31st ranked run defense.        
 Frank Gore (SF) vs. Indianapolis — Gore is off to a slow start, but he is finally getting a favorable matchup against a Colts unit that has coughed up thee rushing TDs and four and a half yards per carry to the position this season.        
Alfred Morris (WAS) vs. Detroit — Despite being limited to a 12-carry average the last two weeks (being on the losing end of two big blowouts), Morris has been able to remain useful with a 10.5 fantasy point average. He takes on a Detroit defense that has surrendered the second most fantasy points to opposing backs so far.        
 Knowshon Moreno (DEN) vs. Oakland — It seems strange referring to the Raiders as a favorable matchup this week as they have given up just 6 fantasy points per game to opposing running backs so far, but take a look at the competition (Vick Ballard and a struggling Jaguars ground game). Moreno will lead the Mile High committee in snaps for a third consecutive week and is an RB2/Flex option this weekend.        
 Wide Receiver 
Mike Wallace (MIA) vs. Atlanta — Wallace was freed from his usual vertical downfield role last weekend, which resulted in great numbers versus the Colts. Pray to the fantasy gods that this trend continues and keep him active against a wounded Falcons defense that is yielding the fourth most points to the position.        
Dwayne Bowe (KC) vs. Philadelphia — Sure, the matchup is drool-inducing (40 FPPG allowed, 1st WR), but Smith’s reluctance to toss it downfield has limited Bowe’s fantasy potential, so keep expectations in check.        
Reggie Wayne (IND) vs. San Francisco — While the surprise Wednesday addition of Trent Richardson further reinforces the notion that the Colts want to emphasize the ground game this season, the typically tough 49ers run defense contains running backs to 3.6 yards per carry. The Colts will be forced to the air to move the chains and the Niners allow 22 points per game to WRs.        
Victor Cruz (NYG) vs. Carolina — The Panthers secondary has allowed the ninth most fantasy points to the opposition and they are dealing with numerous injuries.

"
Weekend,"










“Are you the person that we can ask questions? Or are you just a guard?” If the visitor’s words sting Jeffrey Martinez, he doesn’t show it. After a summer protecting works by the artist James Turrell at the Guggenheim Museum, he has grown accustomed to roving throngs of the baffled.        


Fielding questions is not his job as a guard, but the questioners don’t know that. “They’ll come and say: ‘What’s going on? What is this?’ ” he said. “And they’ll either shrug and move on, or stay and be interested.”        
The dark secret of this acclaimed show, which closes on Wednesday, is that it has mystified a lot of people, whether or not they admit it. Many don’t understand what Mr. Turrell’s quadrilaterals of light projected onto dark backgrounds are about — and why this show is such an art event. You see it in the visitors’ eyes, searching the room for the likewise perplexed. Some, spotting a guard like Mr. Martinez, sidle up with questions.        
He always answers — based on his own reading and on insight foraged from his colleagues. It was not the first time I’d seen guards at this exhibition, which is short on explanatory labels, do the same. They were, after all, the only things standing between many visitors and incomprehension — or in the case of at least one, regretful musing about the number of beers he could have had for the price of admission.        
“If they’re going to pay $22 to get in, they might as well know what it is,” Mr. Martinez said. But he brings to his brief and modest answers empathy not just for the visitor but also for the artist. After all, he, too, is an artist — a lifelong painter who knows that his own work is unlikely ever to require guarding but who has lived for art all the same.        
Tall and thick as a linebacker, with eyes that swell in conversation and just a dusting of buzz-cut hair, Mr. Martinez, 47, was standing on a recent Tuesday in the museum’s High Gallery, beside a Turrell work titled “Ronin,” a vertical corridor of light whose depth and source are its alluring mysteries. One by one, the visitors came, saw, became confused and, very often, sought the guard’s guidance.        
An elderly man who wished to be identified only as Martin walked in and, failing to notice the illuminated strip, pointing instead toward an empty wall, asked, “Is this part of the exhibit?” Mr. Martinez redirected the man’s eyes toward the light, and Martin walked off to stand before it, dutifully communing. “This one I don’t get,” he mumbled.        
Martin was there, he said, because of a friend who gets on his nerves. The friend always finds everything great, wonderful, amazing. Martin thus avoids whatever the friend praises. The friend disliked the Turrell show, which made Martin think, “This one must be good.”        
Now Martin walked back to Mr. Martinez. “So it’s an opening?” he asked, wondering where the light was coming from. Reassured that it was, Martin now declared that he’d understood all along: “My perception isn’t usually that clear, but it was immediately clear that it was a hole in the wall,” he said.        
Not everyone needs to understand. “I wasn’t trying to get it; I was trying to experience it,” said Carol Hoffman, 73, a mixed-media artist from Princeton, N.J. For her, shared bafflement was the point: “We’re with all these other people, trying to figure it out.”        
The 4 p.m. rotation came, and Mr. Martinez moved to another room. He watched adults make shadow puppets in the projected light of another Turrell piece. A Frenchwoman strolled past, putting a spin on the exhibition as “très, très, très minimaliste.” Three Chilean women approached Mr. Martinez and in Spanish asked the “significación” of a work that looked a lot like someone had turned on a home projector without firing up the laptop.        
Mr. Martinez was careful to begin, “There’s no specific meaning, but my own interpretation is ... ” He offered his standard Turrell spiel: This particular artist’s method is to play with your perceptions.        
No one wants to be the person who doesn’t understand, and a moment later one of the women declared herself enthralled: “Beautiful, precious, very exciting!” she said.        
Mr. Martinez cherishes these occasions to rescue a bad encounter with art. “I don’t think I’ll ever be able to find a better job than what I have,” he said.

TOKYO — Hiroshi Yamauchi, who transformed his great-grandfather’s playing-card company, Nintendo, into a global video game powerhouse, died on Thursday in Kyoto, Japan. He was 85.        


The cause was complications of pneumonia, the company said.        
Mr. Yamauchi, who led Nintendo from 1949 to 2002, was Japan’s most unlikely high-tech success story. Named president of the family business at 22, he steered Nintendo into board games, light-emitting toy guns and baseball pitching machines — fruitless forays that he later attributed to a “lack of imagination” — before the company arrived at arcade games.        
Its Donkey Kong and the original Mario Bros. became hits and gave rise to Nintendo’s wildly successful home video game business.        
The Nintendo Entertainment System, a console first released in Japan in 1983 as “Famicom,” unseated early leaders in the video game industry, selling more than 60 million units thanks to shrewd marketing, close attention to product quality and a crop of games based on unlikely yet endearing characters that soon became household names.        
In 1988, The New York Times wrote, “Many Nintendo best sellers, like Super Mario Bros. 2, are based on wildly preposterous premises,” noting that the two mustachioed heroes of that game “endure various trials, such as dodging hammer-swinging turtles and lava balls and man-eating plants, in order to save a Mushroom Princess.” But, the article concluded: “No matter. Kids can’t get enough of the games.”        
Under Mr. Yamauchi, who professed not to understand video games, Nintendo went on to dominate the business. When a successor machine was released in 1990, fans camped outside electronics stores for days in anticipation; it sold almost 50 million units. Next came the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo Game Cube home consoles, as well as Game Boy hand-held machines. Nintendo dominates the list of all-time top-selling games.        
In the early 1990s, Mr. Yamauchi found himself in the middle of an international dispute when he offered to buy a majority stake in the Seattle Mariners. The team, established in 1977, had been threatening to leave Seattle if it could not find a new owner willing to keep it there. Nintendo had its United States headquarters in Seattle.        
The team’s owners approved the deal but the commissioner of Major League Baseball, Fay Vincent, and a four-man M.L.B. owners’ committee initially opposed it. They relented and approved the sale in 1992 after Mariners fans and the Seattle news media rallied in favor of it. In 2001, the Mariners signed the star Japanese outfielder Ichiro Suzuki, now with the Yankees, helping to open the door for many more Japanese players to join major league teams in the United States.        
In a show of his characteristic detachment, however, Mr. Yamauchi confessed at the time that he was not much interested in baseball, either. He said he had never gone to a baseball game and is thought to have never gone since. One of his few hobbies was the Japanese board game Go, which he played at the master’s level.        
Hiroshi Yamauchi was born in Kyoto on Nov. 7, 1927. He was raised by his grandparents after his father, Shikanojo Yamauchi, deserted the family.        
The Yamauchis had been makers of hanafuda cards, a Japanese playing-card game based on flowers, since 1889. Once favored by the elite, it became popular as a gambling game, often played by Japanese gangsters.        
Mr. Yamauchi joined the family business in 1949 after his grandfather had a stroke. He moved quickly to take control at the company, forcing out a cousin and later purging officers appointed by his grandfather.        
But the playing-card business was in terminal decline, and Mr. Yamauchi shifted the company’s focus to one toy after another until he found success with video games in the 1980s. He was helped by the renowned video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, who joined the company in 1977 and created Mario, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda, Wii and other products.        
Mr. Yamauchi developed a strategy that set him apart from other consumer electronics manufacturers in Japan. From early on, he farmed out the production of Nintendo’s video game machines to smaller suppliers, allowing the company to maintain a relatively small staff and low overhead costs. Nintendo approved only a handful of games each year, whether designed internally or by outside companies, ensuring that prices and profit margins remained high.        
There were some misfires under Mr. Yamauchi’s watch. The company’s cumbersome, headache-inducing Virtual Boy portable console — a red box on legs with rubber visors that players peered into to play games in 3-D — was a flop. And beginning in the late 1990s, first Sony, then Microsoft steamrolled into the gaming market with new consoles — the PlayStation and Xbox, respectively — challenging Nintendo’s dominance.        
Mr. Yamauchi stepped down in 2002 — “I have no energy left,” he told reporters — and is credited with going outside the family to appoint a successor to steer Nintendo through rocky times. Under Satoru Iwata, the current Nintendo president, the company roared back with its Nintendo DS hand-held machine and the Wii home game console, though Mr. Iwata, too, has stumbled with the most recent hardware releases and is increasingly under siege by smartphone games.        
Mr. Yamauchi’s survivors include a son, Katsuhito.        
In one of his last interviews, with the magazine Nikkei Business in 2003, Mr. Yamauchi offered a longer view of the gaming market. At the time, Nintendo was being pummeled by Sony’s immensely popular PlayStation 2 console. But he scoffed at suggestions that the battle for supremacy in gaming was over.        
“That’s absolutely wrong; the gaming wars, they will never end,” he said, adding: “That’s just not how this business works. Nobody knows what tomorrow will bring.”

KABUL, Afghanistan — Taliban insurgents have reportedly captured or killed large numbers of Afghan government forces in the remote and usually quiet northeastern corner of the country for the second time this year, officials said Thursday.        


According to Dawlat Mohammad, the governor of Warduj district, insurgents ambushed a police convoy in the district on Wednesday, killing 10 policemen and taking 16 others prisoner.        
A text message sent to journalists from a Taliban official claimed that the insurgents had killed 25 policemen and captured 12.        
But on Thursday, the spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry, Sediq Seddiqi, disputed both the insurgents’ claims and those of the Warduj governor, saying no police officers had been captured.        
The disputed reports were symptomatic both of an increasing casualty rate among Afghan forces and growing government sensitivity about such information. Last year, Afghan officials reported that Afghan National Army soldiers were being killed at the rate of more than three a day, while deaths of police officers were about six a day, twice as high.        
(By comparison, coalition casualties have never reached two a day, and are now fewer than one a day.)        
While hard figures are scarce this year, a number of public comments have suggested a significant increase in casualties on the government side. This month the newspaper The Guardian quoted Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the American military commander, as saying that Afghan forces were losing 100 a week. “I’m not assuming that those casualties are sustainable,” General Dunford was reported to have said.        
If that trend continued, it would represent a substantial increase over last year’s reported 2,970 deaths for Afghan security forces, including both police officers and soldiers.        
On July 22, the interior minister, Gen. Ghulam Mujtaba Patang, addressing Parliament during impeachment proceedings against him, defended himself by saying he had been preoccupied with the rising death toll. “From March 21 up to now, I swear to God, 2,748 police have been martyred,” he said.        
Afghan government officials later disputed General Dunford’s figures, and General Patang’s office issued a clarification saying his number referred to wounded as well as dead.        
Mr. Seddiqi said Thursday that casualty figures had not yet been compiled nationwide, so he was not able to give numbers. “I can say there has been a slight increase in the number of casualties,” he said. He attributed that to Afghan authorities’ taking on greater responsibility as NATO and the Americans have less of a combat role, running more operations and more aggressive ones, and preparing for elections next year by trying to improve security conditions. “I can’t give you the exact percentage of that increase, but it is slight,” he said.        
In Wednesday’s episode, Mr. Seddiqi insisted that no policemen had been taken prisoner in Warduj district, in Badakhshan Province. Mr. Seddiqi said the authorities there had been conducting an operation to clear Taliban fighters from the area and had killed 47 insurgents in the district. He acknowledged that the police had sustained some casualties, but declined to give details until a briefing after the current operation was over.        
“So far we have cleared 90 percent of the district of the Taliban’s presence,” he said.        
Warduj district is also where the Taliban killed one Afghan soldier and captured 22 others in an ambush in March. After negotiations with tribal elders in the area, six of the soldiers were released unhurt, but 16 others were killed by the insurgents.        
Warduj district lies along the highway leading into the Wakhan Corridor, an area of very high mountains bordered by China and Pakistan. Until this year, Badakhshan was one of the quietest areas in Afghanistan.        
“The district governor does not have information about what is really going on in Warduj district,” Mr. Seddiqi said. “He isn’t in there; how could he know?”        
Governor Mohammad, speaking by telephone from his office in the district government building, said that 10 bodies of policemen killed in the attack had already been delivered to the district police headquarters nearby.        
“The Taliban beheaded two of the captured police, and they are threatening to behead all the others,” the governor said.        
His account was partially confirmed by the provincial police chief in Badakhshan, Imam Udin Mutmaeen, who said that nine policemen had been killed in the ambush on Wednesday and that an unspecified number were missing.        
In addition to a general rise in casualties, attacks in which large numbers of Afghan government forces are killed have become increasingly common. When American troops were more involved, it was rare for an attack to kill more than a few soldiers, at least in part because of air support, which Afghan forces do not usually get on their own.        
In April, for instance, Taliban insurgents overran an outpost in Kunar Province, killing all 13 Afghan soldiers there. In May, Afghan forces beat back a Taliban offensive in the strategic Sangin district of Helmand Province, but lost 19 soldiers and policemen in the fight. And in Panjwai district of Kandahar Province in May, an Afghan company lost a fourth of its force, with 20 soldiers wounded or killed.        
Government officials have reported even higher death tolls among Taliban attackers.

ATHENS — European officials expressed concern on Thursday about a rise of extremism in Greece, a day after thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in several Greek cities to protest the killing of an antifascist activist. The Greek police said the killer was a supporter of the right-wing Golden Dawn party.        


Thorbjorn Jagland, the secretary general of the Council of Europe, said “an extremely dangerous development” was emerging in Greece and in other parts of Europe. “Sections of society are becoming more radicalized, and there is a real risk that hate speech turns into violence and coldblooded murder,” he said.        
Prime Minister Antonis Samaras of Greece made another appeal for calm on Thursday, describing the killing of the activist — Pavlos Fyssas, 34, a leftist hip-hop singer — as “inhuman.” He said the government was “determined not to allow the descendants of the Nazis to poison our social life, to commit crimes, to terrorize and to undermine the foundations of the country that gave birth to democracy.”        
Mr. Samaras did not say what actions the government would take, and did not comment on a suggestion advanced by the country’s public order minister, calling for changes in the laws defining criminal organizations to rein in Golden Dawn. The minister late on Thursday sent the Supreme Court prosecutor a list of offenses believed to have been carried out by Golden Dawn and asked for the party to be treated as a criminal organization.        
The party, whose members have been accused of criminal violence against immigrants, has gained popularity recently, especially among Greeks angered by high unemployment and economic woes. Golden Dawn has insisted that it had nothing to do with the killing of Mr. Fyssas.        
Tensions have been growing between Mr. Samaras’s fragile coalition government and the main leftist opposition party in Greece, Syriza, which has also been gaining in popularity. One of the prime minister’s chief advisers, Chrysanthos Lazaridis, said Syriza was also engaged in political violence, and suggested that the leftist party was not part of Greece’s “constitutional axis.”        
Mr. Samaras said, “Political disagreements should be solved with democratic dialogue, not inflammatory arguments or with violence, wherever it may come from.”

NBC will feature one of its icons, Johnny Carson, in an ambitious biopic mini-series, the network announced on Thursday.        
The timing of the special was not announced, nor the crucial decision on who will play Carson. That was in contrast to NBC’s announcement earlier this summer of another mini-series based on Hillary Clinton. In that case, the casting of Diane Lane was central to the announcement.        
The Carson mini-series will be based on a long-awaited biography of the late-night star by Bill Zehme, who also will serve as an executive producer on the show. His book, “Carson the Magnificent: An Intimate Portrait,” is to be published by Simon & Schuster, although its publication has been delayed several times.        
Mr. Zehme is known to have gained access to many of Carson’s personal and professional associates. NBC said the mini-series would include details on Carson’s personal life, going back to his childhood in Nebraska.        



 




"
Weekend,"










As “Dexter” reaches its final episode on Showtime on Sunday night, the question is, will he go or will he go?        


That is, will the serial killer Dexter Morgan head off to happy retirement in Argentina with his family, or end up in some kind of hell, whether above or below ground? Does the man we’ve watched plunging long knives into helpless victims for eight seasons require punishment, no matter how charming and sometimes heroic he’s been?        
The proper fate of the seemingly irredeemable hero is a hot topic in prime time right now, with “Breaking Bad” playing out a similar scenario in its fifth and final season, which ends on Sept. 29. Of course, history tells us that these accountings can be ambiguous: Tony Soprano frozen in his booth at the diner, Vic Mackey consigned to a desk job but reaching for his gun.        
Those finales (of “The Sopranos” and “The Shield”) suggested that dramatic values and the feelings of fans outweigh moral considerations when it comes to ending popular, long-running cable series, and that a good hero is hard to kill off, no matter how many people he’s killed himself.        
The endgame has a different importance, though, in “Dexter,” a more stylized and fanciful show with an even more single-minded focus on its protagonist’s psyche. The question of Dexter’s fate was baked into the gothic premise: a psychopath trained by his adoptive father, a police officer, to be an honorable killer, dispatching only those who needed killing. And the show’s mix of film noir and fairy tale seemed to leave open the possibility of redemption, and even a happy ending.        
The result is that, for at least two and perhaps three seasons, it has felt as if we’d been in a long process of preparation for Sunday night, with story lines whose primary purpose was to push Dexter ever closer to an edge that kept receding as the show’s ratings remained strong by premium-cable standards. (Seasons 7 and 8 have been the show’s highest-rated, averaging 2.1 million to 2.2 million viewers.)        
It has been a frustrating ride for those of us who loved the show’s early seasons, when it achieved an unusually happy balance of interesting long arc (Dexter’s progress toward humanity and his intense relationship with his foster sister, the dedicated cop Deb) and snappy, short-term storytelling (his season-length battles with other serial killers and his dealings with his droll colleagues in the homicide squad of the Miami police).        
In addition to gore, suspense and heartbreak — including the authentically shocking murder of Dexter’s wife at the end of Season 4 — “Dexter” was also marked by its easygoing, sunny vibe and its undercurrent of jabbing workplace humor. As the rest of the cable drama landscape grew increasingly grim and heavy-handed, it was a welcome respite, like picking up a fast and punchy Charles Willeford  novel (“Miami Blues,” say) after slogging through a well-reviewed pretentious literary mystery.        
Even as the story has lost some of its steam in recent seasons, it’s been worth staying around because of the cast, beginning with Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter, as Dexter and Deb, and including excellent supporting performances by David Zayas, C. S. Lee and Desmond Harrington, as cops who never quite figure out that their blood-spatter analyst is murdering people under their noses.        
Ms. Carpenter, the fire to Mr. Hall’s ice in the show’s central relationship, has suffered the most from the need to keep the show going: last season, Deb killed an innocent (a superior officer, no less) to protect her foster brother, and has since been an uneasy partner in his plots. It’s a development that has strained credulity, even in the hothouse context of “Dexter,” and the waters were further muddied by her admission to a therapist that she was attracted to her brother. It probably would have been better if none of these things had happened, which is to say that it would have been better if the show had wrapped up by Season 5 or 6.        
But here we are in Season 8, and the good news is that the pace has picked up recently, as you’d expect. The Icelandic actor Darri Ingolfsson, stepping into the shoes of past guest stars like John Lithgow and Jimmy Smits, has made the Dexter doppelgänger Oliver Saxon a chilling, worthy adversary. Viewers who are up-to-date (spoiler ahead) will know that Dexter’s decision to walk away from a kill — readying himself mentally for that idyllic new life in Argentina — has had potentially tragic results.        
I’ll admit here that I’ve seen the finale and know the answers to my initial questions. I won’t give anything away, except that I expect that it will be controversial — prepare for a Twitter storm around 9:45 p.m. on Sunday — and that while I didn’t buy everything in the episode, I bought the ending. You may or may not think that Dexter’s final resting place is the one he deserves. But it works.

FRANKFURT — Even though the Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its economic stimulus for now, the recent behavior of global financial markets and national economies shows just how tricky it will be for the world to adjust to life without central bank painkillers.         
The mere prospect of a gradual decline in Fed bond purchases in the United States pushed up borrowing rates in Europe in recent months, even as the European Central Bank was trying to tamp them down with its own limited set of remedies.        
But whether in the United States, Europe, or elsewhere, the big doses of monetary stimulus of the sort the Fed has been administering since the global financial crisis erupted five years can go only so far in healing sick economies.        
The withdrawal symptoms as markets have anticipated a Fed tapering of the dosage include the fluctuations in currency values over the summer that added a new element of uncertainty for multinational companies. And an investor exodus from developing countries threatened to undercut the buying power of some of Europe’s most important customers.        
Although European stocks rose Thursday and market rates for government bonds declined after the Fed said it would continue dispensing its stimulus at full strength a bit longer, those movements were very likely only a temporary reprieve from disruptive forces largely outside Europe’s control.        
“This is a deferral, it’s not a cancellation,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. “Higher rates are coming.”        
Now the question is what, if anything, policy makers outside the United States will do about it. In Europe, at least, the early indications are: not much.        
European leaders are still too preoccupied with their own domestic political problems to act more aggressively to stimulate demand and promote job growth for the euro zone. They are too fractured and factionalized to take the actions that are beyond the scope of the monetary policies of the European Central Bank, like spending on common infrastructure or other joint projects that might help put people and companies back to work. And they seem to have run out of energy for further overhauls of the flawed architecture of the currency union, including continued aggressive action to fix Europe’s troubled banks.        
In Germany, the euro zone’s wealthiest country, Chancellor Angela Merkel may be constrained even after elections on Sunday are behind her. That is because, even though her Christian Democrats are likely to retain power, polls on Thursday showed that Alternative for Germany, a right-wing party that wants to dissolve the euro, will probably get enough votes to win seats in Parliament.        
Meanwhile, Italy, which still has one of Europe’s biggest economies despite its debt problems, is once again preoccupied with Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister. Despite his legal perils, Mr. Berlusconi still has the political clout to disrupt the stability of the Italian government.        
Marco Tronchetti Provera, chairman of the Italian tire maker Pirelli, said by telephone that Europeans needed a clear signal that things were getting better so that they would be willing to start spending again. “Without a project to regain confidence, it’s difficult to predict a strong recovery,” he said.        
But he was pessimistic about the ability of European leaders to act. “What we need is a simpler and more effective euro, which means stronger integration with bureaucratic simplification,” Mr. Provera said. “The decision-making process in Europe is too complex.”        
The European economy has emerged from a recession that lasted a year and a half. But the growth has little momentum of its own and remains dependent on demand from abroad, including the United States and developing countries like China and Brazil. As a result, the euro zone is acutely sensitive to policy made in Washington, over which it has little influence.

BERLIN — Germany’s race for Parliament tightened Thursday, three days before elections, with fresh polls underlining the difficulty that even the popular chancellor, Angela Merkel, faces in building a winning coalition.        


Ms. Merkel’s Social Democratic challenger, Peer Steinbrück, a classic center-leftist who has deep experience in Germany’s state and federal governments, urged his party to make the most of what it says is collapsing support for the chancellor and her Christian Democrats.        
“In three days, you can be rid of them!” Mr. Steinbrück told a crowd gathered in Alexanderplatz, in the heart of former East Berlin, accusing the Merkel-led coalition of being “the most quarrelsome, useless and backward-looking” government in modern German history.        
The chancellor herself, Mr. Steinbrück charged, has given no direction in the past four years. Instead, “she prefers to drive around in circles,” like a caged tiger at the Berlin Zoo, he added.        
Two polls published Thursday showed that Ms. Merkel’s coalition had a narrow lead ahead of Sunday’s vote.        
According to a telephone survey for the public television network ZDF, the chancellor’s center-right party is backed by 40 percent of voters, while its partners, the business-minded Free Democrats, are supported by 6 percent. The center-left Social Democrats earned the backing of 27 percent of voters, while their preferred partners, the Greens, earned 9 percent. The poll surveyed 1,369 voters on Tuesday and Wednesday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.        
Another survey conducted by Insa for the newspaper Bild-Zeitung showed that Ms. Merkel’s party had the support of 38 percent of voters, and the Free Democrats had the backing of 6 percent. Support for the Social Democrats and Greens was consistent with the ZDF poll, at 28 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Alternative for Germany, which rejects the euro, garnered 5 percent, compared with 4 percent in the ZDF survey; passing the 5 percent threshold would make it a surprise entry into Parliament. The poll surveyed 2,248 voters by telephone from Sunday to Wednesday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.        
Both major parties, insisting that Germany’s future is firmly in Europe, have ruled out a coalition with Alternative for Germany. If the anti-euro party does get into Parliament, it could reduce the number of seats Ms. Merkel’s coalition receives, forcing her to forge a so-called grand coalition with the Social Democrats.        
That would match the coalition that governed in her first term, when Mr. Steinbrück was finance minister and the pair together guided Germany through the 2008 financial crisis. And it would potentially make Mr. Steinbrück a major player in the next phase of Germany’s leadership, whether his party wins or not.        
Mr. Steinbrück, 66, has said that he will not be part of another grand coalition. But it is increasingly clear that he would like to be part of negotiating whatever program the two big parties can thrash out.        
The uncertainty of the outcome means that the European Union, which has been holding its breath as the German vote nears, is likely to wait a few more months before learning where Berlin would like to guide the troubled Continent.        
Mr. Steinbrück, a bright but sometimes blustering politician, was regarded as a strong alternative to Ms. Merkel, 59, when he declared his candidacy a year ago. Almost immediately, however, he started to stumble, first over disclosures that he had received $1.7 million for speeches and writings, then over whether politicians were paid enough, and next over a suggestion that he would never buy cheap wine.        
His party, which is still divided over a legacy of labor and welfare overhauls that it initiated when last in power under Ms. Merkel’s predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, was slow to get its campaign rolling. Even as late as July, Mr. Steinbrück seemed a somewhat reluctant slogger on the trail.        
Since his lone television debate with Ms. Merkel on Sept. 1, from which he emerged looking as if he could be chancellor, Mr. Steinbrück has taken to campaigning with zest. In a format that is unusual for German election campaigns, which tend to be scripted and repetitive, he has hit the road with a strategy called “plain talk,” in which citizens sit around him as he fields their written questions — filtered through a moderator but not obviously prepared.        
Mr. Steinbrück, who once governed Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, has one of the readier wits on the campaign trail. “I’ll start off answering your questions, and then I think it’s a 120-minute election speech, and I will read it to make it even more boring,” he said as he took the stage one evening in Munich last week, with barely 1,500 supporters shivering through his presentation.        
He has regularly accused the news media of writing his political obituary in advance, reminding a television interviewer on Aug. 30 that in soccer, a national passion here, “it’s not a matter of the first 20 minutes, but of the last 10” as to who wins. “I am amazed at how many people in your profession have already written their ready commentaries,” he added.        
Mr. Steinbrück became a national topic of conversation last weekend when the magazine of the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung showed him giving his middle finger in reaction to an interviewer who had asked him to respond to unkind nicknames attached to him during the campaign. The photo was from late July, when Mr. Steinbrück was far behind the chancellor in personal popularity polls. He still trails, but by less.        
Many Germans say that even if they do not share Ms. Merkel’s center-right politics, they believe that she has done a good job of guiding the nation to relative prosperity in Europe, handling the euro crisis and reducing unemployment.        
Her party, which in the last two elections saw its support drop just ahead of the actual vote, has made Ms. Merkel the center of its campaign.        
Since her Free Democratic partners made a poor showing in Bavarian state elections last Sunday, she has appealed directly to voters, appearing on national television late Wednesday to urge people to cast both their votes — for district candidates and party lists — for her and the Christian Democrats. That, she is telling Germans, is the only way to guarantee she stays in charge.

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Thursday expanded its effort to curtail severe penalties for low-level federal drug offenses, ordering prosecutors to refile charges against defendants in pending cases and strip out any references to specific quantities of illicit substances that would trigger mandatory minimum sentencing laws.        


The move, announced by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. at a speech before the annual conference of the Congressional Black Caucus, builds on a major policy change he unveiled last month to avoid mandatory minimum sentencing laws in future low-level cases.        
“By reserving the most severe prison terms for serious, high-level, or violent drug traffickers or kingpins, we can better enhance public safety,” Mr. Holder said. “We can increase our focus on proven strategies for deterrence and rehabilitation. And we can do so while making our expenditures smarter and more productive.”        
The policy applies to defendants who meet four criteria: their offense did not involve violence, the use of a weapon, or selling drugs to minors; they are not leaders of a criminal organization; they have no significant ties to large-scale gangs or drug trafficking organizations; and they have no significant criminal histories.        
On Thursday, the Justice Department ordered prosecutors to apply the new policy retroactively to defendants who are already in the system but have not yet been sentenced. It was not immediately clear how many pending federal drug cases would be affected.        
In cases where a defendant has been charged but guilt has not yet been determined, prosecutors will be directed to file replacement criminal complaints to eliminate references to specific quantities of drugs that would trigger a mandatory minimum sentence were the defendant to be convicted, according to a three-page Justice Department memorandum from Mr. Holder to federal prosecutors.        
Mr. Holder’s memorandum says that for cases in which a defendant has already been found guilty but no sentence has yet been imposed, prosecutors have discretion about whether to apply the new policy.        
They are “encouraged to apply the policy in guilty-plea cases where legally and practically feasible,” he wrote, but they should generally “not seek relief for a defendant” who chose to go to trial. The memo portrays the policy as an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and directs Justice Department officials to fight any motion by a convicted but not yet sentenced defendant to seek relief without the government’s consent on the basis of the new policy.        
The memo also says “prosecutors should not disturb the sentence in a case in which sentence has been imposed.”        
The Justice Department policy follows efforts pioneered in states including conservative-leaning Texas and South Carolina to control soaring taxpayer money that is spent to incarcerate huge numbers of nonviolent offenders. Still, those changes were approved by state legislatures. By contrast, the Obama administration is undertaking its move without waiting to see whether Congress will approve legislation to restore greater leeway to judges in sentencing.        
The wave of change comes as crime has plummeted to the lowest level in four decades, leading to a bipartisan pendulum swing against the tough-on-crime policies imposed a generation ago amid the crack cocaine epidemic. Those policies resulted in an 800 percent increase in the number of prisoners in the United States at a time when the national population grew by only a third.        
Mr. Holder has repeatedly criticized the moral impact of the nation’s high incarceration rate, emphasizing that while the United States has only 5 percent of the world’s population, it has 25 percent of its prisoners.

WASHINGTON — A company that conducted a background check of Edward J. Snowden, the government contractor who leaked national security secrets, said on Thursday that it had also run a check on the former Navy reservist who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday.        


USIS, once known as US Investigations Services, said that it conducted the check on the reservist, Aaron Alexis, in 2007; Mr. Alexis joined the Navy that year. The company said in a statement that it could not disclose the reason for the check or the results because “we are contractually prohibited from retaining case information gathered as part of the background checks.”        
Mr. Alexis had a clearance that allowed him to get an access card needed to get on the Navy base.        
The company also said that in 2011, it performed a “periodic reinvestigation” of the clearance for Mr. Snowden, who is now wanted by the United States for leaking details of the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs. The Office of Personnel Management has been investigating the company since late 2011, Michelle B. Schmitz, assistant inspector general for investigations, said at a Senate hearing in June.        
The disclosures came as the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, said that Mr. Alexis was “hunting people to shoot” as he made his way through the building but did not appear to have targeted a particular person or group of people.        
“He emerged from the bathroom a few minutes after 8 with the shotgun and proceeded to almost immediately, after coming out of the bathroom, to shoot folks on the fourth floor in a way with no discernible pattern,” Mr. Comey said Thursday. “And, it appears to me he was wandering the halls and hunting people to shoot.”        
Mr. Comey, who spoke at F.B.I. headquarters here, said that Mr. Alexis drove into the navy yard around 8 a.m. on Monday and went right to a bathroom on the fourth floor, carrying a bag.        
Moments later, Mr. Alexis exited with the shotgun. Although the butt and the barrel of the gun had been partly sawed off, Mr. Comey said he did not know whether Mr. Alexis had the shotgun in the bag or had previously hidden it in the bathroom.        
Despite previous accounts from law enforcement officials that Mr. Alexis fired down on people sitting in an atrium on the third floor of the building, Mr. Comey said there was no evidence that he had done that.        
He added, “He shot folks on the fourth floor, the third floor and then went down to the lobby and shot a security guard.”        
After shooting the guard, Mr. Alexis took the guard’s handgun and headed back upstairs, where he continued to shoot people with the shotgun, Mr. Comey said. Mr. Alexis, who kept some ammunition in a pocket of his cargo pants, began using the handgun after he had used all of the shotgun’s ammunition.        
Mr. Comey said that people from different backgrounds and parts of the building were shot, leading him and investigators to believe that Mr. Alexis might not have been targeting a particular person or group, like co-workers.        
About a half-hour after Mr. Alexis started shooting, a heavily armed team from several agencies arrived, Mr. Comey said. A “sustained” exchange of gunfire followed, and Mr. Alexis was killed.

PISCATAWAY, N.J. — Two years ago, Paul James could not get a single Division I football program to notice him. He spent college signing day in 2011 sitting in class at Glassboro High School, in South Jersey. His coaches worked the phones furiously, hoping for a late break. The fax machine stayed silent.        


“It really hit me,” James said. “Like, ‘Wow, I have nothing going for me.’ ”        
More than four dozen other prospects from New Jersey, including running back Savon Huggins, signed letters of intent that day, a glut of talent that Rutgers helped corral.        
To James, Rutgers officials offered this: show up on June 25, and we will give you a walk-on spot. Since then, James has replaced Huggins as the Scarlet Knights’ starting running back, and after three astonishing games, he leads the Football Bowl Subdivision with 493 rushing yards, an average of 8.1 yards per carry.        
When Rutgers (2-1) hosts Arkansas at High Point Solutions Stadium on Saturday, James will receive the bulk of the carries. But he is not the team’s only contributing walk-on. Michael Burton, a fullback, will be blocking for him, in what Rutgers believes to be the only nonscholarship starting backfield for a major college in the country.        
They are the no-star tandem, an improbable twosome in an era when recruiters’ nets are cast wider and wider. An overlooked talent will occasionally amble onto a roster and emerge as a sensation, as Dominique Whaley did at Oklahoma not long ago, when he arrived as if borne from a cloud of dust.        
But in New Jersey?        
“It just shows what we overcame,” James said. “We both came in as walk-ons, and it shows how strong we are to get to this point and how hard we have to work to keep it as is.”        
Burton grew up in Long Valley, N.J., as a die-hard Rutgers fan, attending summer camps on campus as a high school junior and senior. But Burton, who was an oversize, 220-pound running back, said colleges seemed hesitant. He said he had offers from lower-tier programs like Towson, New Hampshire and Maine but only marginal recruiting interest from his top choice, Rutgers. Instead, like James, he was extended a lukewarm invitation: come to practice, and see if you can stick.        
“There are never any guarantees in life; you have to prove yourself every single day,” Burton, a redshirt junior, said. “I use that as motivation.”        
James and Burton were so-called preferred walk-ons, prospects whom the coaching staff noticed and liked but did not offer scholarships. It is not the lowest rung on the college sports ladder, but the ground is mighty close.        
Burton and James began as practice pawns and members of the scout team, often lining up against the first-team defense and mimicking what another team might run. They were in the dredges of the team’s depth chart. But eventually the coaching staff took notice.        
“We don’t really talk about being walk-ons,” Burton said. “We’re out there trying to win games.”        
How did so many programs miss the speedy James, who has six touchdowns in three games?        
“Different players end up in different situations for different reasons,” Rutgers Coach Kyle Flood said. “From what I understand, he had some injury issues his senior year of high school. I think when coaches see that, they are probably less likely to invest a scholarship at that point in a player.”        
James sustained a high-ankle sprain in the third quarter of the first game of his senior year, after rushing for 1,730 yards for tiny Glassboro as a junior. That fall, colleges had begun to show interest — Tulane, Marshall, East Carolina, Temple and even Penn State, James’s top choice.        
But the ankle injury the next season halted his momentum. He missed two games and then began losing playing time to Corey Clement, a talented junior who wound up committing to Wisconsin. James’s recruitment fell off.        
“As his senior year kind of ticked away, a lot of those other schools wound up kind of falling off,” Greg Maccarone, the Glassboro offensive coordinator, said.        
Two lower-tier colleges, Delaware and James Madison, remained interested in James as a defensive player, and Marshall and East Carolina gave him offers that quickly expired. He hedged, and both scholarships were filled.        
So James waited until he could not wait any longer. He began calling colleges and sending tapes, mining for a glimmer of interest. He visited the team closest to home, Temple, as well as Rutgers that May. Greg Schiano, then the coach of the Scarlet Knights, told him he could show up in June and have a roster spot, but nothing else was guaranteed.        
“I could either look at it as an insult or an opportunity to grab,” James said. “I could get in here and work my way up the food chain and get to where we want to be.”        
If it all sounds a bit like the movie “Rudy,” James said the thought had entered his mind, too.        
“If you’re a walk-on, if you don’t have a scholarship, if you weren’t highly recruited, that’s how people look at you: they’ll doubt you,” James said. “You just can’t let that get to you.”

Dining,"










At the sushi counter at Kura, there is no sentinel in white; no silent, coolly appraising overlord. Norihiro Ishizuka, 70, stands alone, wearing not a crisp chef’s coat but a samue, traditionally a monk’s work robe, that slouches at his waist like a dressing gown.        


He has a benevolent and slightly rakish air, with his faint pencil mustache and white-gray hair peeking out of the bottom of his cap. He nods and grins, already halfway to a laugh, and the meal has not yet begun.        
Outside, Kura’s East Village shopfront is austere: a blank wall crosshatched by the shadow of a fire escape, with no sign save a linen drape hanging in an archway, inked with an unfinished circle. Inside, 12 seats line a blond-wood counter. Delicate jazz chimes above.        
But this is not a shrine. Behind Mr. Ishizuka is exposed brick, and the rough edges seem to suit him. No glass cases separate him from diners; instead, fish is heaped unceremoniously in a wide shallow basket. Mr. Ishizuka hefts the fish up and slaps it back down, as if assembling sushi were a purely practical matter, not requiring a soundtrack by Philip Glass.        
The great sushi chefs of New York tend to be musical in their movements. Think of Masato Shimizu of 15 East, the curve of his fingers as elegant as a cellist’s, or Eiji Ichimura of Ichimura at Brushstroke, bending intently over his creations like Glenn Gould and barely speaking above a whisper.        
Mr. Ishizuka is more of a Tony Bennett, a crooner working the crowd with a genial smile and a generous hand. He makes sushi with substantial cuts of fish, tricky to eat in a single bite. Alongside beautifully fresh kampachi, tuna, salmon and aji (horse mackerel) may be aka uni, the larger, sweeter red sea urchin from the Channel Islands off California; scallop balanced on a band of nori over rice; and saba (mackerel) presented Kyoto-style, fish and rice rolled together in cloth and cut like slabs of cake, twice the height of ordinary sushi.        
Keep in mind those rough edges. One evening, the veins of fat in marbled otoro were more resistant than yielding; ikura (salmon roe) was unchecked in its saltiness; tamago (a block of egg scrambled with sugar, sake and dashi) was sweet without nuance. These seemed less like missteps than choices, coming from a fondness for more direct flavors.        
Soy sauce is provided, but no wasabi. You will not miss it. Instead, there are tips of finger limes, to be rubbed on the fish until their tiny juice sacs squeeze out, looking like pale green roe and bursting tartly in the mouth.        
All meals are omakase, starting at a reasonable $65 for 10 pieces of nigiri and a hand roll, which Mr. Ishizuka hands to you across the counter with a flourish; soup (aka dashi, perhaps, deepened with long-fermented black miso); and an appetizer — tuna snowcapped with sticky mountain yam and stippled with nori dust, say, or creamy orange ankimo (monkfish liver) under grated daikon saturated red by chile.        
Also available is Osaka-style kappo, cooked dishes attuned to the seasons, less formal than kaiseki. These may include sesame tofu, which is not tofu at all but a perfect cold cube of ground white sesame paste, its taste at once familiar and ethereal, and tuna tail brushed with an understated teriyaki sauce, charred and strewn with miniature rice-cracker pearls.        
Mr. Ishizuka came from Japan to New York in the late 1980s to preside at Umeda, near Gramercy Park, then decamped to a restaurant in Michigan. One of his partners at Kura, Huey Cheng, worked for him there as a waiter, a role that Mr. Cheng, 24, reprises here, along with helping to make the sushi rice and finishing the kappo dishes in the back kitchen.        
One night, Mr. Ishizuka offered everyone at the counter shiokara, an izakaya snack of fermented squid guts. I had eaten the dish before and still it took my breath away, like downing a jigger of seawater, intensely salty and fishy, sopping yet crunchy. Other diners winced and giggled nervously. Mr. Ishizuka leaned over to an older Japanese gentleman at the counter. “For the young ones,” he said, and they laughed.

Joseph J. Lhota, faced on Thursday with another poll showing him far behind Bill de Blasio in New York’s mayoral race, proposed holding weekly debates, hoping they might alter the dynamics of the contest.        


Mr. Lhota, a Republican, said that the two city-sponsored debates, which are already scheduled for late October, are insufficient, and that the men should face off in all five boroughs.        
“I think it’s important that we go out to the people, and they see the contrast between the two of us,” he said in an afternoon news conference on the steps of City Hall, adding, “We have two very, very different philosophies.”        
Mr. de Blasio, speaking to reporters in the Bronx, did not accept or reject Mr. Lhota’s proposal.        
“We are going to figure out the best way to go about debates, and most importantly the televised debate program where most people have the opportunity to see the contrast between the candidates — and you will see plenty of contrast,” said Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat. “I guarantee there will be a good number of debates. I look forward to them.”        
Mr. Lhota made his proposal shortly after another poll showed Mr. de Blasio with a commanding lead, underscoring the long odds Mr. Lhota faces in a city where Democrats far outnumber Republicans.        
In the new poll, released by Quinnipiac University, Mr. de Blasio had the support of 66 percent of likely voters, compared with 25 percent for Mr. Lhota. The Independence Party candidate, Adolfo Carrión Jr., received 2 percent.        
A poll of likely voters released on Tuesday by WNBC, The Wall Street Journal and Marist College showed Mr. de Blasio with a 43-point lead.        
The Quinnipiac poll found strong support for Mr. de Blasio among men and women, and across every income, education and age group. Ninety percent of black voters supported him, as did 68 percent of Hispanic voters and 52 percent of white voters.        
More voters viewed Mr. Lhota unfavorably than favorably, which may be a consequence of the barrage of negative television advertisements that a Republican rival, John A. Catsimatidis, broadcast during the primary.        
The poll, conducted by telephone from Sunday to Wednesday, included 891 likely voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

The day my daughter arrived home from her first year in college, her boyfriend moved in. They didn’t consult me.        


One day I was happily living alone in my two-bedroom Seattle apartment, and the next I had two teenage roommates, one of whom I hardly knew. The boyfriend, who was still a high school senior, had been my daughter’s summer fling before she left for college last September.        
With my last child gone, I thought I’d be terribly sad and lonely. And I was — for about 10 minutes. After I had spent a brief stint lying on her bed mourning her childhood, I did what my own mother had done: I gathered the stuff she had left behind and moved it to the basement storage unit.        
Then I took over the office nook she had claimed (but hardly ever used) and made it my own.        
I installed shelves and filled them with my reference books. I stocked the refrigerator and cupboards with gluten-free, low-fat food. I bought soap in scents that pleased me and shampoo that suited my hair type. I rearranged the furniture and cleaned the house from top to bottom.        
With each pass of the vacuum, I found myself becoming cheerier. My husband had moved to our farm on Lopez Island in the San Juan Islands of Washington with our two dogs to pursue his dream of being a homesteader, changing our marriage into a long-distance arrangement with occasional weekend visits. I found myself, for the first time in 35 years, living alone in a perfectly tidy apartment. I loved it.        
Then in May, the school year ended and my daughter came home for the summer. After being away for so long, she could barely wait to see her boyfriend. He moved into her bedroom the night she arrived and hardly ever left, except to attend his last few classes of high school.        
The two of them were so enamored of each other, I didn’t have the heart to separate them. I assumed they’d soon grow bored with seeing each other every day and he’d go home. This didn’t happen.        
The biggest problem was that my daughter and her boyfriend brought with them a level of messiness I had grown unaccustomed to. They shed clothing like dogs shed fur, peppering the apartment with sweatshirts, T-shirts and underwear. They preferred my shower to hers and soon the drain was clogged with hair.        
While I was out of town on business, they moved into my bedroom, too; I have a king-size bed and they found it roomier. They produced mounds of laundry, garbage and recycling. The water and electricity bills both shot up.        
My daughter loves cooking and decided that her summer job was to teach her boyfriend to cook. Unfortunately, their enthusiasm didn’t extend to cleaning up. I’d arrive home from work to dirty dishes and half-filled pots and pans on the stove. The kitchen floor would be sticky, the stovetop spattered with oil and the oven bottom crusty with burned food.        
When I asked if the boyfriend might help out a little by doing dishes or taking out the compost, my daughter said, “He’s phobic about getting his hands dirty.”        
“I’m sure that works well for him,” I replied.        
Weeks passed as the lovebirds languished in my apartment. I’d leave for work at 10:30 a.m. and return at 7 p.m. to find them exactly where I had left them: sprawled on the couch watching reruns of “Monk.” The only way I could tell they had even moved was that the food I had bought for dinner was gone and the kitchen was a mess.        
The boyfriend’s mother, upset that her 18-year-old son hardly came home anymore, often called him on his cell. A refugee from war-torn Vietnam, she has high hopes for her son, and I often overheard him arguing with her in Vietnamese. One day when he and my daughter put in a brief appearance at her house, his mother sat my daughter down and tried to explain that her son was college bound and nothing, especially a girlfriend, was going to stand in his way.        
When I asked my daughter how the conversation had gone, she replied, “She’s nuts.”        
Over dinner one night at a local restaurant, I vented my frustration to my friend Howard.        
“Why are you allowing it?” he asked, incredulous that I hadn’t put my foot down.        
“Liberal mother syndrome?” I said. “It’s probably a reaction to my own experience.”

"
Weekend,"










Jhumpa Lahiri first made her name with quiet, meticulously observed stories about Indian immigrants trying to adjust to new lives in the United States, stories that had the hushed intimacy of chamber music. The premise of her new novel, “The Lowland,” in contrast, is startlingly operatic. Udayan, an idealistic student in Calcutta in the 1960s, is drawn into Mao-inspired revolutionary politics. After his violent death (which happens fairly early in the novel), his devoted, dutiful brother, Subhash, marries his pregnant widow, Gauri, and brings her to America in hopes of giving her a new start in a new country. Their marriage, though, will remain haunted by their memories of Udayan and a terrible secret Gauri keeps to herself.        


“The Lowland” is certainly Ms. Lahiri’s most ambitious undertaking yet, and it eventually opens out into a moving family story. It is initially hobbled, however, by pages and pages of historical exposition, by a schematic plotline and by a disjunction between the author’s scrupulous, lapidary prose and the dramatic, Dickensian events she recounts. It is only in the second half that Ms. Lahiri’s talent for capturing the small emotional details of her characters’ daily lives takes over, immersing us in their stories and making us less aware of the book’s creaky and often noisy hydraulics.        
In her 2003 novel, “The Namesake,” as in her two collections of short stories (“Unaccustomed Earth” and the Pulitzer Prize-winning “Interpreter of Maladies”), the lives of Ms. Lahiri’s characters were made palpably real to us, through her exacting evocation of their day-to-day routines: the Wonder Bread sandwiches, tinted green with curry, that a Bengali mother makes for her embarrassed daughter to take to school, the careful adoption of American rituals like making snowmen or dyeing Easter eggs. Such particulars accentuated the differences between immigrant parents and their American-born children, and the almost existential sense of dislocation that exile can produce in people who feel at home neither in their ancestral country nor in the United States.        
While the reader came to know these earlier people as distinct individuals, the characters in “The Lowland” seem to have been conceived as representative types with designated roles to play in a family melodrama constructed to underscore generational patterns of resentment and redemption, rootedness and freedom. Udayan is the rebellious, impulsive brother, who makes a series of reckless decisions that will affect everyone who loves him for decades to come. Subhash is the nice, rational brother, who will spend much of his life dealing with the fallout from his sibling’s heedless actions. Gauri is an angry, selfish woman, who will repay Subhash’s generosity and kindness — and his efforts to invent a new life for them in Rhode Island — with chilly disregard.        
Subhash’s mother had tried to dissuade him from marrying Gauri, telling him that she’s “Udayan’s wife, she’ll never love you.” She also warned him that Gauri was “too withdrawn, too aloof to be a mother.”        
Though this prophecy has been delivered by a woman embittered by the death of her favorite son, it will turn out to be all too true: Gauri will abandon her daughter, Bela — conceived with Udayan and brought up by Subhash as his own beloved child — to pursue her own dreams of studying philosophy and building an academic career. Ms. Lahiri never manages to make this terrible act — handled by Gauri with cruelty and arbitrary highhandedness — plausible, understandable or viscerally felt. Why would Gauri regard motherhood and career as an either/or choice? Why make no effort to stay in touch with Bela or explain her decision to move to California? Why not discuss her need to leave her marriage and her child with her husband?        
Because Ms. Lahiri never gives us real insight into Gauri’s decision-making or psychology, she comes across not as a flawed and complicated person, but as a folk tale parody of a cold, selfish witch, who’s fulfilling her nasty mother-in-law’s worst predictions. The reader often has the sense that Ms. Lahiri is trying to fit her characters into a predetermined narrative design, which can make for diagrammatic and unsatisfying storytelling.        
What turns this novel around and ultimately seizes the reader’s imagination is Ms. Lahiri’s deeply felt depiction of Subhash’s relationship with Bela: his unwavering devotion to this good-hearted little girl; his bafflement as her grief over her mother’s abandonment leads her to withdraw from him as well; his slow, painful efforts to rebuild a life for himself in the wake of Gauri’s departure.        
It is in these later chapters that the cumbersome historical exposition and overarching narrative architecture fall away, and Ms. Lahiri’s most shining gifts as a writer come to the fore: her ability to conjure the daily texture of people’s lives, her understanding of how their personal and cultural expectations have shaped their choices, her talent for mapping moods and inchoate emotions with pointillist precision.        
As this happens, the characters in “The Lowland” — with the qualified exception of Gauri — become fully human: driven not by one identifiable trait (like duty, anger or rebellion) but by a full spectrum of feelings, and capable not only of rage and vexation but also of forgiveness and hope. By its end, this ungainly novel reminds us of Ms. Lahiri’s copious talents as a writer, however imperfectly they are employed here.

Sports,"










Madison Bumgarner and the Giants felt right at home during the first leg of an extended stay in New York.        


Bumgarner struck out 10 in seven innings of four-hit ball, outpitching Jon Niese to lead San Francisco over the Mets, 2-1, on Thursday.        
Juan Perez went 3 for 3, with a run-scoring single, in his hometown, and San Francisco, last season’s World Series champion, won for the eighth time in 11 games. After taking two of three from the Mets, the Giants will not even change hotels — they remain in New York this weekend to play three interleague games at Yankee Stadium.        
Plenty of San Francisco fans visited Citi Field all series, and the Giants received a loud ovation as they walked off after the final out.        
“It’s nice to have a good fan base like that,” Bumgarner said. “Especially this far away.”        
Bumgarner (13-9), who needs one more strikeout to reach 200 in a season for the first time, had the 13th game of his career with double-digit strikeouts.        
Niese (7-8) pitched seven solid innings for the Mets, who rallied for four runs in the ninth to win, 5-4, on Wednesday night. They batted .184 while going 4-7 on their penultimate homestand.        
“I established all of my pitches, threw them all for strikes, got my cutter working on both sides of the plate,” Niese said.        
Josh Satin had a leadoff double in the fourth for the Mets’ first hit. He scored on Daniel Murphy’s single, but Bumgarner avoided further damage.        
The Mets begin their final trip Friday in Philadelphia. Third baseman David Wright is expected back after missing seven weeks with a hamstring injury.

Displays of antique miniature portraits can serve as giant diagrams of connections among families, their fortunes and the artists who painted the works. Sometimes there’s a whiff of scandal.        


Wall captions and apps in an exhibition gallery can explain how the rosy faces in jeweled frames reveal that “this person slept with this person, this person was related to this person, this person was the enemy of this person,” Cory Korkow, a curator at the Cleveland Museum of Art, said in a phone interview.        
This fall, the museum is bringing out about 170 British portrait miniatures that have largely been in storage since the 1950s. The show is among several exhibitions of images painted on bits of ivory, vellum, enamel and paper that are planned or under way in the United States and Britain.        
“It’s a bumper time for miniatures,” Jo Langston, a Christie’s specialist, said in a phone interview.        
On Nov. 20, Christie’s in London is to auction about 230 miniatures (with estimates from $1,600 to $800,000 each) that T. S. Eliot’s widow, Valerie, hung in a London apartment with peppermint green walls. Depictions of George IV’s daughter, Charlotte, and his brother Frederick’s coquettish girlfriend, the Countess of Tyrconnel, were kept in odd proximity.        
Given the complicated back stories, Ms. Langston said, “it’s impossible not to get distracted when you’re doing research on miniatures.”        
Next Friday, two dozen miniatures will go on view in “Beauty’s Legacy: Gilded Age Portraits in America,” at the New-York Historical Society. They belonged to Peter Marié, a 19th-century Manhattan shipping tycoon of French-Caribbean descent. Around 1890, he inexplicably began commissioning and exhibiting hundreds of images of his era’s wealthiest beauties.        
Mr. Marié never married, nor is he known to have had any serious romantic relationships.        
“He represented a modern version of the chivalrous courtier, whose love for women was in the abstract and never consummated,” the curator Barbara Dayer Gallati writes in the show’s catalog, to be published this fall by Giles.        
On one oval in the “Gilded Age” show, Mrs. Bradley Martin, an extravagant society hostess, is dressed as Mary, Queen of Scots. Mrs. Armstrong Chanler, a novelist who became a morphine addict, is depicted wearing a bohemian rumpled cape. Amy Bend, shown in a simple blue gown and no jewelry, spent much of her life “blighted by vanity and fear of losing her beauty,” Ms. Gallati writes.        
The artists’ biographies are fraught, too. Katherine Arthur Behenna, who painted the Chanler image, had delusions that a spirit named Helios was guiding her. She died in 1924, when she was roughly 64, after apparently poisoning herself with Chinese hair dye.        
Tumultuous lives are also documented in a new book, “Miniatures From the Time of Marie Antoinette in the Tansey Collection” (Hirmer/University of Chicago Press). It reproduces about 170 works from a German museum collection, along with thumbnail biographies of patrons and artists who squandered fortunes and fled regime changes and creditors.        
One impoverished French painter, Nicolas Hallé, persuaded a client, a German heiress named Barbe Rommel, to marry him. In the Tansey catalog, the historian Bernd Pappe writes that soon after the wedding, “her husband gambled her money away, maintained an affair with a dancer at her expense and even attacked her physically.”        
Caddish miniaturists like Hallé, whose divorce proceedings were widely published, left paper trails. But more reputable characters, like the 17th-century British artist Samuel Cooper, are frustratingly elusive.        
“I want to strangle the man — he left very, very little,” Emma Rutherford, the curator of “Warts and All: The Portrait Miniatures of Samuel Cooper,” which opens on Nov. 13 at the Philip Mould Gallery in London, said in an interview.        
Samuel Pepys described Cooper as “the great limner in little.” Cooper’s colleagues respected him, too; he was brought in to paint Van Dyck’s steely mistress Margaret Lemon, who posed as a male cavalier. When Van Dyck married someone else, she is said to have tried to bite off his thumb.        
The Cleveland show contains Cooper’s unfinished portrait of the philosopher Thomas Hobbes. It is rumored to have once belonged to the Duke of Devonshire, and Charles II owned a finished version that is now believed to be lost.        
The catalog from the show discusses the field’s unanswered questions and gives detailed provenance notes that make recent prices for miniatures easy to find online. A 1660s image of the Virgin Mary and Child, by an obscure artist named Anna Maria Carew, went for around $4,600 in 2008 at Sotheby’s in London. In 2005, a pair of 1780s portraits of a couple, with the wife shown wearing her husband’s miniature as a pendant on a pearl strand, sold for around $6,700 at Christie’s in London.        
Recounting researchers’ discoveries about the sitters and past owners can help increase the appeal of the little paintings and counter the notion that they are cute or stuffy.        
“Sometimes their provocative and mysterious qualities get obscured by their preciousness,” Ms. Korkow said.        
Elle Shushan, a miniatures dealer in Philadelphia who helped the Cleveland museum assemble its collection, will be taking part in a Private Art Dealers Association show at 13 East 69th Street in Manhattan, from Nov. 1 through 16. She is bringing the prolific itinerant artist Anson Dickinson’s 1807 portrait of Susan Bayard Rogers, a Manhattan arts patron who commissioned mahogany furniture from Duncan Phyfe.        
“She was a visionary,” Ms. Shushan said in an interview. Mrs. Rogers died in 1814 at the age of 36, leaving behind four small children, while en route to France for a rest cure for an unknown ailment.        
  CRAVING SPACE FOOD 
Leftovers from Apollo space mission meals are enticing collectors at sales of astronaut memorabilia.        
In March, dehydrated potato soup from Apollo 13 sold for $8,125 at Bonhams in New York. In April, unopened packages of Apollo 17 brownies, fruit salad, peaches and bread cubes brought up to $4,100 each at Heritage Auctions in Dallas.        
On Oct. 3, Regency-Superior auctioneers in Los Angeles plan to offer 1960s and ’70s NASA packages of rye bread and an orange drink (estimated at $200 to $400 each). “Zipper still operates nicely,” the catalog notes of one pouch.        
Buyers are drawn to the colorful three-dimensional evidence of the variety of food that was available in orbit, despite the lack of gravity and hot water, and the inventive engineering of the containers.        
“One of the big no-no’s was to have crumbs floating around,” Cassandra Hatton, a Bonhams specialist, said in an interview.

SAN FRANCISCO — This was already going to be a banner season at the San Francisco Opera for the American soprano Patricia Racette. Her performances always thoughtful and touching, Ms. Racette has long been a favorite here and she was scheduled to star in no fewer than three of the year’s eight productions.        


Then, as tends to happen in the hyperdramatic world of opera, calamity struck. Late last month the powerful mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick, who had been given the title role in Tobias Picker’s new opera, “Dolores Claiborne,” an adaptation of the Stephen King novel, dropped out, citing bad knees and the part’s vocal and physical challenges.        
Ms. Zajick had an understudy, the veteran mezzo Catherine Cook, but the company no doubt wanted a bigger name for such a prominent premiere. So Ms. Racette, who has created roles in two prior Picker operas — “Emmeline” (1996) and “An American Tragedy,” presented by the Metropolitan Opera in 2005 — stepped up and learned the part in time for opening night on Wednesday. (Ms. Cook will sing the two final performances, scheduled for early October.)        
Ms. Racette’s admirable move was that of an authentic trouper, a gutsy act that should not be underestimated, particularly since Ms. Racette is concurrently starring in Boito’s “Mefistofele.” You want her to succeed.        
If in the end, though, she merely acquits herself nicely, it is more the fault of Mr. Picker and his librettist, the poet J. D. McClatchy, than it is hers. Their drab “Dolores” has a drab Dolores at its center.        
Which is surprising, since dullness is the one thing you couldn’t accuse Mr. King’s 1992 best seller of being. (This is the first operatic adaptation that Mr. King has approved, but not the last: “The Shining,” by Paul Moravec and Mark Campbell, is scheduled to open at the Minnesota Opera in 2016.) “Dolores Claiborne” takes the inherently theatrical form of a monologue: Dolores, an aging housekeeper on a tiny island off of Maine, is at a police interrogation, denying the charge that she murdered her rich, capricious employer, Vera Donovan.        
Dolores does, however, freely confess to killing her husband, Joe St. George, decades earlier. She is irresistibly profane, candid and contentious as her story plunges back to her miserable marriage to Joe, a lazy alcoholic who beat her and sexually abused their daughter, Selena. During a solar eclipse she finally lured him, drunk and furious, into the backyard well, ensuring Selena’s future but also, painfully, their estrangement.        
There is clear operatic potential in a woman who turns homicidal when she has her back up against the wall. Not for nothing is the San Francisco Opera calling Mr. Picker’s “Dolores Claiborne” an American “Tosca.”        
But Puccini, ruthlessly effective in his melody and his dramaturgy, makes you believe, to the depths of your being, in the love that propels Tosca’s fate forward and the evil that stands in her way. His pacing is swift and inexorable.        
Mr. Picker and Mr. McClatchy, on the other hand, have created an opera that hovers rather than hurtles. While we are told that Dolores cares for Selena — they sing a duet, after all — we never feel it, so her sacrifice doesn’t pack any punch.        
That is not to say that Mr. Picker’s craftsmanship is ever less than expert. His score, cleanly arranged for a traditional orchestra, is consistent and coherent in its post-Romantic brooding rather than fashionably eclectic. Conducted by George Manahan, it simmers clearly enough to make all the exposition audible; the scenes are separated by interludes full of grand waves of sound.        
There are lovely details throughout. Early in the first act, Vera’s admonition to her maids about properly hanging the sheets to dry, set to angular jitters, opens up into sumptuous ardor, then closes again into anxiety, with an ease of transition that recalls Janacek. The collaborators have invented an ingeniously creepy nursery rhyme for Joe (the resonant, fearless bass-baritone Wayne Tigges) to sing as he molests Selena, with a translucent, percussive accompaniment.        
But as with too much contemporary American opera, the vocal lines, stranded between speaking and singing, dissonance and tonal lyricism, leave sen-TEN-ces with odd, stil-TED STRESS-es. And the trappings of traditional grand opera, embraced by Mr. Picker, don’t serve this particular story.        
A party scene at Vera’s mansion promises to be like the wedding in “Lucia di Lammermoor” — interrupted by some horrible public revelation — but nothing much happens. Two soaring arias, one for Dolores and one for Selena, both seem extraneous, meant to relieve tension but serving only to halt momentum. (Selena’s, sung with pure tone by the soprano Susannah Biller, is an ode to the stars, that ultimate poetic cliché.)

A BIG GIFT TO THE MET GROWS EVEN BIGGER 


The philanthropist Leonard A. Lauder’s $1 billion gift of 78 Cubist paintings, drawings and sculptures to the Metropolitan Museum of Art included 14 works by Fernand Léger, a robust number even for a world-class institution.        
In April, when the gift was announced, Mr. Lauder said he planned to keep adding to the collection, but, as he said, “only if the right things come along.”        
A painting by Léger can be counted as one of those “right things.” On Thursday the Met hung “The Village,” a newly acquired oil, in its first-floor modern and contemporary art galleries, where it will remain through at least the end of the year. “My goal is to make this a destination collection,” Mr. Lauder said in a telephone interview. “These paintings are getting rarer and rarer.”        
The canvas, depicting a medieval village with a Romanesque church at its center, was created in 1914 at a pivotal moment in Léger’s career.        
“It is the culmination of Léger’s ‘contrast of forms,’ “ said Emily Braun, Mr. Lauder’s longtime curator, referring to a series of paintings and drawings based on oppositions of shape, line and color. Although Léger is known best for his images of urban dynamism, in this picture (and in a second, identically sized version of it in the Sprengel Museum in Hanover, Germany) he painted a village using the colors of the French flag — blue, white and red — as a patriotic gesture since he made these works right before leaving to fight in World War I.        
For decades “The Village” had been in a French private collection, Ms. Braun said. And while it may be the 15th work by Léger in Mr. Lauder’s collection it is the earliest to join the Met’s holdings. “It’s our first Léger that predates World War I,” said Rebecca Rabinow, a curator in the Met’s department of modern and contemporary art. “Here the artist is using cones and pyramids to represent a village scene.”        
It also joins an interesting and varied group of other paintings from 1914 that are in the Met’s collection. These include Monet’s “Path Through the Irises“ and Renoir’s portrait of the actress Tilla Durieux. “It’s fascinating the diverse responses to the political instability that was engulfing Europe,” Ms. Rabinow said.        
ART AT METROTECH 
It has been 20 years since the Public Art Fund joined forces with Forest City Ratner, developer of the MetroTech Center office complex in Downtown Brooklyn. Together they have presented annual contemporary art installations at the center’s plaza and commons. The program started out as a showcase primarily for emerging New York artists, but as it has matured it has started to encompass a more established and international roster of names.        
The latest is Katharina Grosse, a German artist who is creating a major installation that is part sculpture, part painting and part architecture. Called “Just Two of Us,” the installation, on view from Oct. 27 through Sept. 14, 2014, is a response to several visits Ms. Grosse made to the site. It’s composed of 18 monumental fiberglass-coated forms about 15 to 25 feet long and 18 feet tall, placed in two large groupings in the plaza and emblazoned with the artist’s signature spray paint in bright bursts of color.        
“They will look like Technicolor meteorites falling from the sky,” said Nicholas Baume, director of the Public Art Fund, the nonprofit organization that created the program for MetroTech. “The sculptures pick up upon the tradition of abstract painting combined with street art, and create the sensation of floating into the trees.”        
“Just Two of Us” will be Ms. Grosse’s first public art project in New York. “Although she’s a very established artist,” Mr. Baume noted, “she hasn’t had much of a presence in New York.”        
PAULA COOPER POP-UPS 
Paula Cooper can’t help herself. Whenever she walks around Chelsea and spies an empty space, she investigates.        
The upshot is that her gallery, which already runs two locations in Chelsea, at 534 and 521 West 21st Street, will be overseeing two pop-up spaces. One, which opened this week, is at 197 10th Avenue, near 22nd Street, in what was an auto parts shop. The second, on the ground floor of 521 West 21st Street, below the gallery’s second-floor space there, is opening next month.        
Both spaces are small. The one on 10th Avenue is just 1,000 square feet; the 21st Street space is a mere 170 square feet. So far Paula Cooper has scheduled two shows in the 10th Avenue space: the first is devoted to works by Alan Shields, the American artist known for creating vibrant collages from scraps of cloth, thread, even pipe cleaners, beads and stained fabrics that are often attached to unstretched canvas. Shields died in 2005. The second show, in January, will be by the Los Angeles artist Liz Glynn.        
No shows have been scheduled for the other space yet. “This is the antidote to the supersized galleries,” said Steven P. Henry, director of the gallery. These small, scrappy spaces, he said, “remind me of the side streets of SoHo and the East Village in the ‘80s.”        
“We have 25 artists, and this is a way of doing things serendipitously,” he went on. “If a younger artist has an idea, we can respond to it quickly.”        
FROM THE MET TO TEXAS 
Since he left the Metropolitan Museum of Art to become director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, last year, Gary Tinterow has wooed several of his former colleagues to join him in Texas. The latest is Malcolm Daniel.        
A pre-eminent scholar of 19th-century photography, Mr. Daniel is a senior curator at the Met and a former head of the photography department. He is succeeding Anne Wilkes Tucker, the founding director of the department of photography at the Museum of Fine Arts, who is retiring in June 2015. Mr. Daniel, who starts his job in December, will work alongside Ms. Tucker until then. In addition to being the museum’s curator in charge of photography, he will also oversee special projects.        
Mr. Daniel joins Mahrukh Tarapor, a former associate director for exhibitions and director for international affairs at the Met who is now the Houston museum’s senior adviser for international initiatives. And Deborah Roldán, a former research associate at the Met, who had helped Mr. Tinterow organize that museum’s Manet-Velázquez show in 2003,” has become assistant director of exhibitions in Houston.

                            Violence against children strikes most people as a uniquely terrible phenomenon, which may be why filmmakers are so fond of it. Nothing sparks a revenge plot, or allows a director to trade intellectual nuance for visceral feeling, quite as efficiently as a child in peril. When dealing with people who gratuitously cause the innocent to suffer, no retribution seems too extreme, and the history of movies is full of good men (and a few women) driven to righteous brutality against predators, kidnappers and abusers.        


                            Keller Dover, the enraged, grief-addled father played by Hugh Jackman in Denis Villeneuve’s “Prisoners,” seems like such a character. “He’s not a person,” Keller says of the man he believes is responsible for the abduction of his young daughter and her friend. And this conviction, that the apparent perpetrator has forfeited his humanity, allows an honorable family man to contemplate torture and murder. He beats his captive bloody and locks him in a makeshift cell in an abandoned building, hoping to extract the truth and perhaps also a measure of rough justice. When the other girl’s parents (Viola Davis and Terrence Howard) express doubts about what Keller is doing, their qualms strike him as evidence of weakness and irrationality.        

                            But if “Prisoners,” written by Aaron Guzikowski, upholds some of the conventions of the angry-dad revenge drama, it also subverts them in surprising, at times devastating ways. The easy catharsis of righteous payback is complicated at every turn, and pain and uncertainty spread like spilled oil on an asphalt road.        

                            When the girls, Anna and Joy, go missing late on Thanksgiving afternoon, suspicion focuses on the driver of a camper that had been parked in their small-town Pennsylvania neighborhood. An arrest is made of a young man (Paul Dano) who seems mentally disabled and shares no information about the girls’ whereabouts. Then a dead body is found in an elderly priest’s basement, and a second young man, with a nervous manner and a haunted look, shows up at a vigil for the missing children and runs away into the night. False leads and shadowy connections proliferate, and nobody knows if Anna and Joy are dead or alive.        

                            It’s all very creepy and mysterious, and “Prisoners” is, among other things, a satisfying whodunit, with artfully deposited clues and twists that are surprising without entirely undermining the film’s naturalistic credibility.        

                            But Mr. Villeneuve, a French Canadian director whose previous movies include “Incendies” and “Polytechnique,” is more invested in mood and meaning than in plot. A connoisseur of grim tales — “Incendies” is about the endless trauma of a Middle Eastern civil war; “Polytechnique” is based on the true story of a shooting rampage at a Montreal university — he has an intense, almost philosophical interest in the nature of evil.        

                            Like “Zodiac,” “Mystic River” and “The Silence of the Lambs,” “Prisoners” suggests that evil is not confined to a single person or set of actions. Crimes are specified, and criminals are discovered, but empirical solutions are not enough to dispel the feeling that an uncontained atmospheric menace broods over this wintry landscape. (Roger A. Deakins’s somber cinematography turns the Keystone State into a study of grays and browns, dead leaves and bare trees, under a sky like wet metal.)        

                            Keller, a survivalist with a basement full of canned goods and batteries, seems to have been infected by it even before the disappearance of his daughter. His wife (Maria Bello) tips into a pool of despair. Other people, like the aunt of one of the suspects (Melissa Leo), are weighed down by bad luck and weary dread.        

                            But the most tormented character may be Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), whose connection to the kidnapping is professional rather than personal. Like Keller, Loki is a familiar figure in a movie like this, and the contrast between them — the hotheaded, impulsive avenger and the cool, careful sleuth — is something we’ve seen before. Mr. Jackman is solid and persuasive, but it is Mr. Gyllenhaal, with his downturned mouth and twitchy eyes, who anchors the film. We know nothing of Loki’s off-duty life, if he even has one, but he is the sensitive, skeptical filter through which we try to imagine the fate that could have befallen two happy children playing on a November afternoon.        

                            Nearly all of “Prisoners” takes place within a single week, but Mr. Villeneuve wisely — if also somewhat cruelly — refuses to speed up, or to spike the action with jolts of adrenaline. He captures, with impressive discipline, just how slowly time can move during a crisis, how the static condition of not knowing can press down on every moment. Panic can be paralyzing, as it is for Keller’s wife and Joy’s parents, but acting rashly, as Keller is inclined to, can have catastrophic effects.        

                            “Prisoners” is the kind of movie that can quiet a room full of casual thrill-seekers. It absorbs and controls your attention with such assurance that you hold your breath for fear of distracting the people on screen, exhaling in relief or amazement at each new revelation. By the end, you may be a little worn out, and perhaps also slightly let down by the fussily clever revelations that wrap up the story, but in the meantime, you are a willing captive, unable to tell the difference between dread and delight.        

“Prisoners” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Graphic violence and profanity.

Steve Murphy swears he has nothing against his parents.        


But at age 27, Mr. Murphy, who has his own financial planning business, does not feel like he should still be living in his childhood home in Massapequa, Long Island.        
“I think I’m pushing the limit, to be honest with you,” he said. “But you almost become complacent. You almost think it’s the norm.”        
In a sense, it is. According to a new report from the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and policy group, 55 percent of all 20- to 34-year-olds on Long Island still live with their parents, which is up 11 percent in a decade and appears to be one of the highest rates in the country.        
But while some may actively choose to sleep in full view of their teenage posters and trophies, most are there because there are few other places they can go.        
Nassau and Suffolk Counties suffer from an acute shortage of rental apartments, according to the report, “Long Island’s Rental Housing Crisis,” which states that the place that practically invented the postwar tract suburb has failed to keep pace with housing trends since.        
For years, government officials, housing advocates and real estate executives on Long Island have warned about the exodus of young people, not to mention the difficulty of housing lower-wage earners.        
But the Regional Plan Association report draws some tough conclusions. “The shortage of affordable rental homes is already straining Long Island’s economy and will make it much harder to compete for jobs in the years ahead,” it said.          
What seems hard to dispute is that Long Island is seriously crunched for apartments compared with other suburbs.        
Based on census data, 21 percent of Long Island’s households live in rentals, compared with 33 percent in Western Connecticut, 34 percent in the Hudson Valley and 37 percent in Northern New Jersey, numbers analysts consider a healthier portion.        
Long Island’s 4 percent vacancy rate is also at the low end of the scale, putting pressure on rents, which average $1,490 a month in counties where income has steadily declined, according to the report.        
Blame for the problem can be laid at the feet of many of the island’s nearly 100 village governments, whose zoning bans have severely restricted multifamily housing, said Christopher Jones, the vice president of research for the Regional Plan Association and an author of the report.        
By contrast, in New Jersey, there’s been a spike in the construction of rental housing since the state’s Supreme Court ruled in the early 1980s that municipalities could not use zoning to exclude lower-income people — and by extension, often, minorities — from wealthy areas.        
Mr. Jones stressed that tweaking the zoning on Long Island to allow more apartments doesn’t have to mean that the low-slung, spread-out look of the island — epitomized by the curving Cape-lined streets of Levittown — would disappear.        
Indeed, the rentals could be added in compact downtown business districts, which could in turn benefit from customers in their often struggling stores, he added.        
“The character doesn’t have to change,” Mr. Jones said. “You will still have the same single-family neighborhoods that people think of when they think of Long Island. “There will just be more choices.”        
Yet the pro-growth slant of Mr. Jones’s report has irked some critics, who note that some of the report’s contributors — employees of building trade associations and banks, for instance — stand to gain from development projects.        
Long Island has been troubled by a tight rental market since the 1940s, when its farms began to get plowed under for subdivisions, said Robert W. Burchell, the chairman of the urban planning department at Rutgers University. Dr. Burchell knew that scenario firsthand. From 1947 to 1959, when he was a child, his family rented a series of homes in Nassau County. “We had to move anytime the landlord found somebody willing to pay more,” he said.        
But Long Island for the most part has prospered all the same, with low crime rates, good schools and high property values, all the hallmarks of a desirable area, he said.

Homeowners with a mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs should consider using their loan terms as a marketing tool when it comes time to sell.        


Mortgage loans from both government agencies include a little-known feature known as assumability. In other words, the buyer of a home financed with an existing F.H.A. or V.A. loan may be able to take over, or assume, the seller’s loan, under the same terms, rather than take out a new mortgage.        
During periods when interest rates are rising, homes offered for sale with an assumable, lower-rate mortgage may have extra appeal for certain buyers.        
“You could now have a seller saying, ‘I have a great house to sell you and a great mortgage to go with it, which is better than my neighbor, who only has a great house,’ ” said Marc Israel, an executive vice president of Kensington Vanguard National Land Services and a real estate lawyer. “It’s a very clever idea.”        
The savings for buyers assuming a loan extend beyond a lower interest rate. Assuming a loan is cheaper than applying for a new one because there are fewer settlement fees. An appraisal is not required (though a buyer may want to obtain one anyway). And in New York, borrowers assuming a loan do not have to pay the hefty mortgage recording tax a second time, Mr. Israel said.          
F.H.A. loans do demand that the borrower pay for mortgage insurance over the life of the loan. But when assuming a loan, borrowers do not have to pay the upfront mortgage insurance premium required on a new loan, according to John Walsh, the president of Total Mortgage Services in Milford, Conn.        
And, he noted, because the original mortgage holder would have been paying the loan for a number of years, the buyer assuming the loan will start at a point deeper into the amortization schedule than on a new loan. That means more of the monthly payment will go toward principal.        
“In a rising rate environment, assumability is a very attractive option,” said Katie Miller, the vice president of mortgage products for Navy Federal Credit Union. “It ends up making homes that much more affordable.”        
She emphasized, however, that loan assumptions are often not a viable option for first-time buyers if the seller has accumulated substantial equity in the home.        
Say, for example, that the seller’s loan balance is $150,000, and the sale price for the property is $200,000. The borrower assuming the loan must come up with the $50,000 difference, either in cash or through some type of subordinate financing.        
That can be too big a hurdle for first-time buyers. The more attractive option at Navy Federal is the HomeBuyers Choice loan, which offers 100 percent financing. These loans currently account for about a quarter of the credit union’s purchase volume, and 65 percent of those borrowers are first-time buyers, Ms. Miller said.        
Borrowers seeking to assume a loan must also prove their creditworthiness as they would for any F.H.A. or V.A. loan.        
Under F.H.A. rules, once a new borrower is found to be creditworthy enough to assume a loan, the lender must release the seller from any future liability for payment of that loan.        
Borrowers considering loan assumption should weigh the costs against other loan options, paying attention to the principal and interest payment, the amount of cash required upfront, and the private mortgage insurance premium. “At the end of the day,” Mr. Walsh said, “if the prospective buyer can come up with the down payment and qualify for the loan assumption, then it could be a huge benefit.”

The New York Times Company announced on Thursday that it would pay a quarterly dividend to its shareholders for the first time in five years.        


The company’s board voted to approve a dividend of 4 cents a share to all shareholders of record as of Oct. 9, 2013. It will be paid on Oct. 24, the week before The Times announces its third-quarter earnings. The Times has not paid a dividend since Dec. 14, 2008.        
The dividend, which applies to both Class A and Class B shares, will cost the company roughly $24 million a year.        
In a statement, Mark Thompson, president and chief executive of The Times, said that the board had concluded “that the strength of the balance sheet justified the restoration of a dividend.”        
But Mr. Thompson warned that the company would remain cautious in its financial strategy.        
“Given the expectation of continued volatility in advertising revenue and the fact that our growth strategy is at an early stage of development, we will maintain a prudent view of both the balance sheet and free cash flow,” he said.        
During recent earnings calls, analysts have repeatedly asked Times executives to issue a dividend. In the first quarter of 2013, analysts noted that there was a sell-off of the company’s stock after management announced it would not issue a dividend because of concern about the financial state of the media industry. But in August, The Times reported that it had swung to a profit from stronger circulation revenue and lower operating costs.        
John Janedis, an analyst with UBS, said that it made sense for The Times to issue a dividend now because the company was selling its final noncore asset, The New England Media Group, which includes The Boston Globe. After that sale closes next month, The Times will be able to focus exclusively on building its core brand, The New York Times.        
“You basically have a clean balance sheet, you have free cash flow at the company,” Mr. Janedis said. He added that a dividend also made sense “given how much the company has slimmed down in terms of assets.”        
Mr. Janedis estimated that The Times could afford to pay shareholders the dividend despite the media industry’s financial challenges.        
“Even if the ad market weakens further and there is virtually zero return on their growth initiatives, they can easily fund the dividend if not increase it,” Mr. Janedis said.        
In its last earnings report, The Times reported that, as of June 30, it had cash and securities totaling about $918 million.

Foreign,"










LONDON — Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, appeared to have Prime Minister David Cameron on the ropes. Mr. Cameron had just lost a vote in Parliament on a nonbinding motion to consider military action in Syria over chemical weapons, the first time in at least a century that a prime minister had not gotten parliamentary support for such a response. Mr. Cameron threw in the towel.        


But Mr. Miliband, whose own position on the issue kept shifting, did not seize the moment, neither that night, Aug. 29, nor in the next days. He neither spoke convincingly to the nation about the nature of its alliances, its foreign policy or its values, nor did he attack Mr. Cameron effectively for mismanaging the entire issue. In a sense, both major party leaders showed themselves unable to master their own restive parties.        
After three years as head of Labour, Mr. Miliband, just 43, has not managed to convince the British public that he is prime ministerial material. Questions about his leadership will hang over his party’s annual conference, which begins Sunday.        
In the words of a columnist for the newspaper The Guardian, Michael White, Mr. Miliband, while having good instincts, “flickers rather than shines.”        
John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, said more bluntly that polling shows that “Mr. Miliband is clearly not a help to his party and he may well be a hindrance.” The coalition government of the Conservative Mr. Cameron and the Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg is unpopular, Mr. Curtice said, but there are deep doubts among voters about whether Mr. Miliband believes in anything very strongly.        
“People are unclear what he stands for,” Mr. Curtice said. “It’s not just that he’s seen as geeky or intellectual, he hasn’t managed to show people that he has a vision and a sense of direction. There’s a lack of definition.”        
Mr. Miliband, who became the Labour Party’s leader three years ago — after a devastating election defeat that ended 13 years of Labour government — always had a huge task ahead of him, even with new elections not expected until May 2015.        
“He became leader a few months after his party was rejected comprehensively,” said Peter Kellner, a political analyst who runs a polling firm, YouGov. “He was a cabinet minister and close to Gordon Brown, so he was implicated in the wider reputation of a government that failed. Any new Labour leader would have trouble combating that.”        
Mr. Miliband, Mr. Kellner said, “has plainly not managed to break through as a person — there are mountains of data on our Web site on how he is not regarded as strong or tough or up to the job as prime minister.”        
In any case, Mr. Kellner noted, Britons historically give new governments a second chance. It has been decades since a party new to opposition won a majority government after a single term.        
Mr. Miliband has real strengths, beyond intelligence and decency. He did not support Britain’s involvement in the Iraq war, which so badly damaged Tony Blair, and he boldly opposed Rupert Murdoch’s powerful media empire in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.        
“In my view, Ed’s leadership has been characterized by courage, resilience and a determination to stand up for families who have borne the brunt of economic tough times,” said Stewart Wood, a close adviser to Mr. Miliband. “He stood up to Rupert Murdoch, he stood up to David Cameron on Syria, and he has not been afraid to say that Labour has to turn the page from the Blair/Brown years.”        
Mr. Wood said that Labour’s emphasis on how to “reverse the decline in living standards that face most people in our country” will help the party regain popularity. With the economy finally improving and the election more than 18 months away, Labour will argue that a modest recovery will benefit only a small slice of British society that needs no help.        
Part of Mr. Miliband’s problem stems from his past as a bright young aide and then minister in Labour governments, and part comes from the residue of his extraordinary decision to run for the leadership against his older brother, David Miliband, who was a more senior figure, having been foreign secretary. It was an openly Freudian struggle, which the younger Miliband won narrowly with the help of trade union votes — David Miliband had come out ahead among Labour lawmakers and party members.        
Mr. Miliband had struggled to lose both the taint of fratricide and the stain of being beholden to trade union bosses, who are not the most popular figures in Britain.        
To avoid further speculation, David Miliband finally quit his own seat in Parliament and left the country, recently beginning a new job in New York as the head of the International Rescue Committee, a nongovernmental organization aiding refugees.        
Mr. Cameron highlights the influence of union leaders whenever possible. So recent claims that a union had rigged the selection of Labour’s candidate to fight a parliamentary seat in Falkirk, Scotland, proved highly embarrassing.        
Mr. Miliband set up an inquiry, which found no rules were broken. But more boldly, in an effort to show decisiveness, he also announced plans to end the automatic affiliation to Labour of about three million union members unless they specifically ask otherwise. While union members will still be invited to join the party, Labour faces an inevitable and significant drop in financing.        
Still, recent statements suggest that unions may retain significant influence over some Labour decision making, prompting claims that Mr. Miliband is backtracking and will accept a half-measure. His allies argue that an overhaul will be more successful step by step. But he may gain little credit anyway, Mr. Curtice said, given the perception that he was forced into change by the Falkirk controversy.        
Were Mr. Miliband a Tory leader with similar ratings, Mr. Kellner said, he would be subject to a possible putsch. But Labour has little tradition of dumping its leaders.        
Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg are not themselves especially popular. Mr. Clegg is considered to have sacrificed crucial elements of his electoral agenda to get his party into the governing coalition, and is clearly the junior player to Mr. Cameron.        
Mr. Cameron has overseen tough years of economic austerity and recession, and he is being outflanked on the right by an anti-European party known as the United Kingdom Independence Party, or UKIP.        
Mr. Curtice thinks that Labour should be significantly farther ahead in the polls than now; its lead over the Tories has shrunk considerably since early summer. Still, he said, given an electoral system that favors Labour because of the distribution of its voters, the unpopularity of the Liberal Democrats and slippage of Conservative votes to UKIP, “the Labour Party might win by default.”

Don’t go looking for fancy Italian at Osteria Cucina Rustica in Marlboro. Despite the imposing facade of this restaurant in a former bank, the fare is indeed rustic, as the name suggests. Flavors are simple.        


Quality is high, and most everything is made in-house. Much of what I sampled on two visits was well prepared — a main dish of risotto with delicate and juicy grilled shrimp, each grain separate and slightly al dente; exquisite branzino fillets, perfectly pan-seared and seasoned with butter, shallots, white wine, lemon and a sprinkle of capers, laid over a bed of beluga lentils; hearty hanger steak that was tender and delicious enough to continue eating past satiety.        
Service is old-school indulgent. We were led to our tables by young women; all the waiters were attentive men in lab-style white coats who paid attention to water and wine and apologized when the main courses took too long to arrive.        
Prices for such service, food quality and attention to detail are not cheap, but they are fair. Others seem to agree, since there was a robust-size crowd there both nights: On my first visit, a weekend, several diners accompanied by women and children displayed full sleeve tattoos; on a weeknight, though there were a few women and couples, it seemed more like a businessmen’s club.        
The ambience is mixed. Wide plank floors, salvaged from old barns around the country, with exposed beams above, say down-home; the high ceilings and the sleek white tiles seen in the partly open kitchen behind glass suggest sophistication. The space is also inordinately loud, and the air-conditioning was so cold on both visits that I contemplated using the elegantly large napkin as a shawl.        
The owners, Angelo Bongiovanni, who acts as host, and Steven Botta, the chef, opened the restaurant in mid-July; they are also partners in Brando’s, an Italian restaurant in Asbury Park, Mr. Bongiovanni said in a phone interview.        
It is clear that they care about the food. A trio of amusements — roasted garlic in olive oil; herbed ricotta; and pickled zucchini — arrived alongside a basket of warm bread, and were tasty with the addition of a bit of salt.        
Among the appetizers, the fritto misto, which was mostly calamari with a cameo of shrimp and scallops, was nicely done, the fried batter enhancing rather than distracting from the seafood; the inclusion of caper berries, their stems on, tucked into the seafood was a witty touch. Burrata, a special with prosciutto one night, was diminished only slightly by its cool temperature; the polenta with shaved black truffle was agreeably hot, but too much pecorino Romano masked the flavor of corn.        
Of the three salads, the Caesar, with its romaine hearts and ciabatta croutons, was best; ingredients in the Toscana — chopped greens, red onion, tomato, cucumber, sliced almonds and dried cherries — stubbornly resisted melding, and the finocchio, a combination of fennel with Parmigiano-Reggiano, toasted pine nuts and sliced orange, lacked flavor.        
A special appetizer of figs stuffed with Maytag blue cheese and roasted garlic, then wrapped in prosciutto and set atop small ovals of cool watermelon, was a terrific idea, but with every bite, I wished that the prosciutto had not been broiled to brown but left pink and luscious.        
Among the pastas, the Bolognese sauce was well flavored and balanced, but the pasta served with it, pacheri (imagine very fat, unwieldy rigatoni) left us wondering how to eat it, since we certainly couldn’t twirl it around a fork. Farfalle with Swiss chard, Gaeta olives and toasted breadcrumbs was flavorless — hard to fathom with such assertive ingredients.        
As for the secondi, that stellar branzino, risotto with shrimp, and Barolo-glazed hanger steak faced competition from the pollo scarpariello. The pan-sautéed chicken pieces with sausage and lemon were served with just enough potato pieces to mash into the juices.        
Vegetables were uninspired, except for the mashed potatoes and intensely flavorful cherry tomatoes served with the hanger steak. Sautéed broccoli rabe was exceedingly mild, to the point of boredom. And I had hoped the Swiss chard with fava bean purée would be a riff on the Italian beans-and-greens stew, but no. It was a portion of greens with a scoop of greenish-gray matter on top. Yes, that was the beans, and they tasted O.K., but the dish needed a do-over.        
Of the typical Italian desserts, we liked the zabaglione and the affogato (vanilla ice cream topped with espresso); of the atypical, the warm chocolate cake with a small scoop of ice cream was memorable enough to put on my list for the next time I’m in the neighborhood — after a Caesar salad and that branzino over lentils.

The last time we tasted mencías from Bierzo, Spain, my recipe included rosemary, the wines’ dominant herbal note. Consistency may be someone else’s hobgoblin, but it’s nice to see it in wines; there was that rosemary again.        
Pairings often welcome contrasts, but this time I picked up the flavors and aromas of the wine and tossed them into the pan. Green peppers, a hit of chile, olives and a beefy smoke. All have been incorporated in this dish.

“Behind Closed Doors: Art in the Spanish American Home, 1492-1898,” at the Brooklyn Museum, leaves us in the strange position of marveling at the opulence of domestic life in the Spanish colonies while pondering some of the ugliest aspects of colonialism. This is awkward, to be sure, but also enlightening.        


As its voyeuristic title suggests, the show follows the layout of a typical house belonging to an elite member of New World society. Drawn largely from the museum’s sizable collection of Spanish colonial art, it fashions a gorgeous set of temporary period rooms out of the fourth-floor special-exhibition galleries. They overflow with sumptuous textiles, family portraits bearing coats of arms, fine silver and porcelain and gilded everything — arranged in the more-is-more manner of the Spanish American upper crust, with cabinets stacked in pyramids and luxury goods laid out on carpeted platforms.        
All this conspicuous consumption was as strategic as it was materialistic. It was a way for newly wealthy Creoles (in this context, Spaniards born in the Americas) and people of indigenous ancestry — barred from important church and government positions because they were not born in Spain — to thumb their noses at the Spanish crown. Dignitaries from Spain who visited one of these homes would see potent reminders of the New World’s natural resources.        
They would also, at times, see Spanish Americans asserting their own noble lineages, in genealogies or portraits of Inca royalty painted in a European style. One such painting, of 14 Inca kings, hangs at the exhibition’s entrance next to Goya’s 1806 painting of “Don Tadeo Bravo de Rivero,” a Peruvian who edged his way into Spain’s chivalric orders through military service. One of the few Creoles able to do so, he flaunts the cross and jeweled badge of the Spanish Order of Santiago.        
As these examples suggest, obsessions with race, bloodline and birthplace — some particular to the Spanish colonies, others more widespread — haunt “Behind Closed Doors.” Visitors are constantly confronted with family trees and other more or less hereditary claims to power. (Titles could be purchased, but the buyer first had to prove noble ancestry and a “purity of blood” — a phrase that effectively meant people of Jewish or Moorish descent need not apply.)        
Also on view are “casta” paintings that employ a rigid racial-classification system; one is called “From Spanish and Indian, Mestizo,” and shows a Spanish man and his indigenous wife with their mestizo, or mixed-race, baby. Here too are works that are not quite casta paintings but seem closely related, such as the group portrait “Free Women of Color With Their Children and Servants in a Landscape” by Agostino Brunias (an Italian working in the British colonies). The painting is not as progressive as it sounds; it reinforces colonial hierarchies of race and class by surrounding its fashionable young heroine — one of the “free women” of the title — with darker-skinned attendants who may well be her slaves.        
In some of the decorative artworks, at least, cultures mix and mingle freely and without the need for taxonomies. A highlight is a large folding screen that once graced the viceregal palace in Mexico City. One side shows battle scenes based on Dutch prints from the Great Turkish War; the other depicts a hunting party modeled on those in Gobelins tapestries. Both have been rendered by Mexican artists in a traditional shell-inlay technique known as enconchado, on an object — the six-paneled screen — long associated with Asia.        
And in various places throughout the show, the museum’s European Art curator, Richard Aste, juxtaposes Spanish colonial art and furniture with similar objects from the British colonies. In doing so, as he notes in the catalog, he is continuing a dialogue from a 1999 installation in the museum’s American Paintings galleries. (Viewers of “Behind Closed Doors” might also want to visit “Interwoven Globe: The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800,” which has a similar cross-colonial frisson, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.)        
It’s a lively one, especially when portraits go head to head: Miguel Cabrera’s stern 1760 painting of a wealthy Creole, Doña María de la Luz Padilla y Gómez de Cervantes, for instance, versus John Singleton Copley’s steely 1772 depiction of Abigail Pickman Gardiner, married to the wealthy Boston landowner Sylvester Gardiner. Seeing them together lets you compare and contrast the fashion and beauty trends particular to their respective colonies; Doña María’s face is dotted with chiqueadores, or glued-on beauty marks, while Mrs. Gardiner wears a billowy “costume à la turque” of a salmon-colored robe over green harem pants.        
“Behind Closed Doors” offers an intimate look at the lives of colonial women. We come to know some of them, like Doña María, through their formal portraits; others, like the wealthy indigenous landowner María Angela Cachicatari, through private paintings and objects in their possession. A large and fascinating section of the show recreates the estrado, a parlorlike area of the home where women passed much of the day socializing, drinking yerba maté and doing needlework while sitting cross-legged on floor cushions.        
These glimpses of the good life — and enough decorative installations to fill many an interior designer’s inspiration board — are what we expect from a show on the homes of the wealthy. But in this exhibition, the severity of colonial subjugation is just as visible and, in the end, more affecting.        



 
“Behind Closed Doors: Art in the Spanish American Home, 1492-1898” continues through Jan. 12 at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park; (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

As one of those interviewed by Evan Mandery for his meticulously researched book, “A Wild Justice,” about the Supreme Court’s capital punishment decisions, I am pleased that it received the praise it deserves from David Oshinsky (Sept. 1). But it is not the case that “no source for the meeting” ending in the agreement between Justices Stewart and White that led to the court’s decision in the Furman case “appears to exist.” The verbatim private conversation between the justices is, of course, unknown, but there is no doubt the meeting was held, that White’s position shifted and he became the decisive fifth vote. By searching out the law clerks who worked closely with Stewart and White, Mandery did what no author before him (including Oshinsky and me) had dared. As a result, multiple sources in the chambers of both justices support on the record his version of what happened.

I was surprised by Joyce Carol Oates’s comment at the end of her review of “The Childhood of Jesus” (Sept. 1) that “this isn’t the ‘Don Quixote’ of Cervantes but, in a perplexing Borgesian twist, the author is ‘a man named Benengeli,’ ” and that “perhaps, one day, Elizabeth Costello will enlighten us.” Considering that Cervantes presented his “Don Quixote” as the translation of a chronicle of true events written by one Cide Hamete Benengeli, this doesn’t strike me as particularly perplexing, unless she’s waiting for enlightenment about why J. M. Coetzee decided to make Cervantes’s narrative device the truth in the world of this book.

In her essay (“Articles of Faith,” Sept. 1), Dara Horn is quite right in stating that in Judaism, “faith itself is largely built on the concept of preserving memory.” We celebrate the power of memory not just on Rosh Hashana, the Day of Remembrance, but on all the holidays — when we recall the Exodus from Egypt as well as the entrance of our ancestors into the Promised Land, the various harvests of the crops and even the creation of the world on the Sabbath. Moreover, four times a year we recall loved ones, gone but not forgotten, at the Yizkor (memorial) services. The founder of Hasidism, Israel Baal Shem Tov, observed: “Forgetfulness leads to exile; remembering is the key to redemption.” Undoubtedly, remembering has enabled the Jewish people to survive against all odds.

Dara Horn’s clever meditation on Jewish memory, while a delight to read, leaves the impression that Jews are distinct in their piety to history. This is nonsense. Religious holidays mark alleged historical events from Easter to Ramadan as much as Jews “stand again at Sinai.” Such commemoration cuts both ways. Serbian nationalists evoke centuries-old battles against the Turks to justify hostilities against Muslims, and Protestants march in Northern Ireland to commemorate victories over Catholics. A variety of religious communities are urged not to forget in order to justify present political decisions. Jews today fret about the pogroms of Passovers past, but Orthodox West Bank settlers also reimagine Palestinians as enemies from the biblical Amalek to Nazis. “Preserving” memory — often through misremembering — can be as dangerous as it can be pious.

Dara Horn calls the suggestion that the anxiety that attends Passover may be traced to the terror Jewish ancestors felt while preparing the Seder in a time of murderous pogroms a “mystical and irrational belief in a type of memory no neurologist would recognize.” But psychoanalysts are very well acquainted with the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The children and, we are now discovering, the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Holocaust survivors are seriously wounded people. They can certainly heal, but scars always remain. I would not consider it mystical or irrational to hypothesize that centuries of serious Easter-linked trauma could still be sending out ripples not-that-many centuries later.

Considering whether novelists are overly reluctant to write critical reviews of fellow novelists in the new Bookends column (Sept. 8), Adam Kirsch mentions, by way of contrast, the example of Virginia Woolf’s work for The Times Literary Supplement, where, as he puts it, “she specialized in harsh verdicts suavely delivered.” He omits a crucial fact, however: Woolf’s reviews were published anonymously, as was standard practice at the T.L.S. until the 1970s. The threat described by Kirsch, that a negative review can “make an enemy for life,” is not one that Virginia Woolf faced, and we can only be thankful that anonymity allowed her to give free rein to her keen critical intellect.

A few minutes into Laura Parnes’s 70-minute horror movie, “County Down,” I thought, “This is bad.” The acting is wooden, the sets amateurish, the writing banal, the pace erratic. Moreover, Ms. Parnes used a digital program that turns photographic reality into a hallucinogenic cartoon, as Richard Linklater did in his brilliant films “Waking Life” and “A Scanner Darkly.” But in Ms. Parnes’s case, the trippy effect comes off as crude and garish. The whole thing looks like it was made by an enterprising but not exceptionally talented high school student. Knowing it to be actually a sophisticated spoof made no difference. I wondered how I was going to get through an hour of it. After a while, however, it began to seem interestingly bad. Then it became mysteriously fascinating. I couldn’t stop watching.        
The plot of what Ms. Parnes’s Web site describes as a “web-based episodic digital film” is complicated. Set in a wealthy, gated community, “County Down” revolves around the invention and distribution of a psychedelic drug — delivered and consumed in nippled baby bottles — by a teenage girl named Angel. For unclear reasons, her parents and those of her friends are going insane. There are zombies, cannibalism and murder, including a matricidal decapitation. It’s a blatantly ridiculous and yet weirdly compelling soap opera; “Night of the Living Dead” meets “Pretty Little Liars.”        
Serious-minded viewers might find in Ms. Parnes’s film social commentary on addiction, consumerism, the media, adolescent angst, suburban ennui and so forth. Whatever. Mainly, it’s a hoot.

Distinctive enough to capture major attention, but too diverse to be readily branded, the German artist Michael Buthe had a substantial European career in the 1970s and ’80s, but faded from view after his death at 50 in 1994. More recently, interest in him has been increasing abroad, and Alexander and Bonin, who represent a somewhat similar artist, Paul Thek, continue to be Mr. Buthe’s New York champions with a third solo show.        
Mr. Buthe, like Mr. Thek, was gay, Roman Catholic, and sought sources for art outside his own culture. He was well enough established in his 20s to be included in the legendary 1969 exhibition “When Attitudes Become Forms.” A year later he first visited Morocco and in 1972 spent nearly five months there in the beguiling seaside city of Essaouria. Its high-color buildings and cornucopian souks cast a spell that saturated his art, which moved from quasi-Minimalism to Orientalist-hippie environments to small, exuberant pictures that brought Sigmar Polke, a fellow art school student, as well as Paul Klee, to mind.        
There’s a nice suite of such work upstairs at Alexander and Bonin, though the main show consists primarily of three large pieces. The 1985 “Landscape (Spanish Energy),” a dense assemblage incorporating a pitchfork, brocade and the image of a staring eye, finds Mr. Buthe in a theatrical mode, while a pair of 15-foot-long abstract triptych paintings recall his minimalist roots.        
The two triptychs share a title, “The Last Secret of Fatima,” a reference to a reported appearance, in Portugal in 1917, of the Virgin Mary to three children, to whom she entrusted three secrets. Two were made public in the 1940s, and the third, after heated speculation, in 2000. Both pictures are composed of two monochromatic panels (blue in one painting, red in the other) covered with all-over patterns of tiny stars and joined by a third, vertical panel in silver and gold. The results suggest blank icons, Yayoi Kusama dot paintings with hinges, and stereoscopic views of intergalactic space. They’re lovely. And as to secrets, the power of art (and religion) to let them stay secret is certainly one.

Through Oct. 20 
Although heavy-handed in its symbolism, Joanna Malinowska’s latest solo is a high-spirited exploration of the North American frontier and its uses and abuses by modernist artists.        
Mixing sculpture, video and performance, it makes clever, theatrical use of a space that’s cavernous by Lower East Side standards. The main component is a six-ton pile of dirt trucked in from the Yukon Territory, which nods obliquely to works by Robert Smithson and Walter de Maria but is mainly a set for a performance. (Visit the gallery at the right time, and you might see Ms. Malinowska panning for gold.)        
Nearby is another set, this one derived from Isamu Noguchi’s austere designs for the Martha Graham/Aaron Copland ballet “Appalachian Spring.” Titled “Bootleg Noguchi,” Ms. Malinowska’s version substitutes a crooked tree branch for the original production’s rectilinear wood frame.        
On video, a Russian composer reads aloud from Allen Ginsberg’s poem “America,” his strong accent and deadpan manner working against the ranting verse. This piece isn’t subtle — and neither is the giant papier-mâché bear, modeled on roadside monuments in the Yukon, that towers over the gallery — but both have a role to play in the Polish-born Ms. Malinowska’s affectionate skewering of cold-war-era pioneer myths.

The protean Carol Bove continues to cultivate her extraordinary garden, operating in the gaps between art and design, modernism (especially Minimalism) and nature, language and structure, found and made, order and chaos, her work/art and other people’s work/art. One of the best artists of our peculiar moment, Ms. Bove started with appropriation sculptures consisting of shelves displaying worn, carefully chosen paperbacks on often arcane, metaphysical subjects. Here this opposition is manifest in a large sheet of glass suspended between I-beams and flanked by two columns of the gallery; it serves as an immense frame for a small Gordian knot of a painting, “Design for the Qor Corporation,” by the polymath artist and kabbalist Harry Smith. It is also implicit in the inclusion of a vitrine of eccentric geometric drawings by and from the archive of Lionel Ziprin and Joanne Ziprin, who formed the mystically inclined, geometry-obsessed Qor Corporation, also a tile business, with Mr. Smith.        
The grid is a living, growing thing in Ms. Bove’s universe. It is presented here as fragmentary and possibly mutating in a low-lying structure of small, perpendicular I-beams. It is definitely, elegantly mutating in “Peel’s Foe, not a set animal, laminates a tone of sleep,” two concrete blocks that form a seven-foot monolith, the upper one eaten away by a metastasizing grid of shiny brass. Her white tubular “glyph” sculptures, while all curves, imply infinite extension in their own way, while breathing new, gently irreverent life into generic public-art abstraction. The molecular, metabolic nature of the grid is signaled by the inclusion of a sculptural and mathematical feat from 1976 by Richard Berger: the top surface of his couch iterated in small lead pellets suspended from micro-filaments. It also seems implicit in the monumental piece of petrified tree trunk that Ms. Bove has attached (with only six bolts) to a tall I-beam, where it resembles a torso, a broken column and its former self.        
As if this weren’t enough, Ms. Bove and Philip Smith, a rare-book dealer, have organized a dense exhibition about the Qor Corporation in Maccarone’s project space at 98 Morton Street. It contains more drawings by Mr. Smith and the Ziprins and much more (studies and prototypes for tiles) in which geometry truly loses its mind and gains the universe.        
Meanwhile, the title of Ms. Bove’s show says a lot: “RA, or Why is an orange like a bell?” It flags her work as Relational Aesthetics at its most profound and inclusive and flippantly posits the unity of natural and artificial form with a riddle from Batman’s foe, the Riddler. Answer: They both have to be peeled (or pealed). This show is endless.

The Victorian pastime of flower pressing looks decidedly contemporary in Virginia Poundstone’s latest solo, which makes it difficult to separate nature and artifice, art and craft, and maybe even the quick and the dead.        
Here, crushed botanicals also link several mediums: digital photography, monochrome painting, and glass and bronze sculpture. In a series of wall-based works, for instance, Ms. Poundstone has printed images of floral bouquets on perforated vinyl and then sandwiched the fabric between glass, leaving many folds and creases that don’t conform to our expectations of the botanical still-life.        
Even more confounding are the sculptures, small, nubby-looking bronzes with poured-glass accents. Identified as “fossils,” they are cast from plaster impressions of flower petals and rest on stacked-cardboard presses in lieu of traditional pedestals. The different materials, volumes, and sculptural techniques make you think about the structural complexity of a living blossom and the difficulty of preserving it.        
The paintings “Gold Rush” and “High Roller,” which cover small wooden panels with uniform arrangements of silky yellow petals, are the most conventional works here. Their titles, however, are suggestive; they bring to mind the 17th-century Dutch phenomenon of tulipmania, as well as more current forms of economic speculation. And they round out this sometimes cerebral show with a burst of color and texture that’s intensely gratifying, however long it lasts.

Through Oct. 26 
Born in Tehran in 1982, Barbad Golshiri is part of a generation of young Iranian artists who, working primarily at home, are distancing themselves from the easy exoticisms that sell well abroad. At the same time, they’re trying to make art that’s critically responsive to contemporary Iran, and to a political culture that opposes, on ideological grounds, much of what they’re doing.        
Mr. Golshiri’s tough, wiry second New York solo is made up of sculptural grave markers, most of them in the horizontal format of Muslim tombstones. At least one piece directly subverts the traditional model. Called “Pentimento,” it’s a flat rectangle of black iron pierced with a cluster of stakelike uprights and carries a heretical inscription: the customary Arabic invocation “There is no God but Allah” reduced to two words: “no God.”        
Other pieces are dedicated to political martyrs. One tombstone, incised with a labyrinth pattern, commemorates Ahmad Mir-Alaei, a translator of Jorge Luis Borges into Persian, who was killed in 1995 in the so-called chain murders of Iran, reputedly carried out by government agents, that wiped out dozens of dissident writers and intellectuals, many of them friends of the artist’s father, the novelist Houshang Golshiri (1938-2000).        
Another memorial, designed for a dissident who had been officially denied a tombstone, consists of a stencil-cut of a funerary inscription that can be temporarily but repeatedly applied to the site of the grave. The show, a collaboration with Aaran Art Gallery in Tehran, includes tributes to Western artists and writers (Jan van Eck, Samuel Beckett) Mr. Golshiri holds dear, as well as a marker for himself, which looks like a work in progress. Surely its existence is premature, but in the context of work about the politics of death, the message is: Be ready; you never know.

Few wine notions are tossed around as frequently and as randomly as “balance.” Often it’s stated axiomatically, as in, “Good wines must be balanced.” Who can argue with that?        


Sometimes it’s used as a rationalization, as when speaking of ultrahigh alcohol wines: “Alcohol is just a number. It doesn’t matter, as long as the wine is balanced.”        
I take issue with that statement. Alcohol manifests itself in many ways beyond a feeling of heat on the palate. It affects the texture, the body and, naturally, the physical effect of a wine. Balance is just a small part of that overall equation.        
I’ve been thinking about balance since the wine panel not long ago tasted 20 bottles of red Bierzo, from Castilla y León in northwestern Spain, just east of Galicia. Bierzo is one region that has helped usher in the exciting modern era of Spanish wines.        
The primary red grape, mencía, can make wines ranging from light and pretty to dense and structured, yet always with beguiling, exotic aromas of wild red fruit. The style depends on the intent of the winemaker, of course, but also, importantly, on where the grapes were grown. Those on terraced slate hillsides, for example, tend to be more concentrated and complex than those from clay-based soils on the flatlands.        
We have tasted Bierzos several times over the last eight years. In the past we’ve been thrilled by the unusual qualities of these wines, and by our own sense of discovery. We’ve observed Bierzo, an ancient wine region yet new to the world of international wine commerce, as it navigated the intricacies of global business, wavering between a desire to appeal to established popular tastes and a devotion to what made the wines distinctive in the first place.        
In our latest tasting, we saw a region that has moved past the thrill of the new (though eight years may feel like an eternity to modern attention spans, it is nothing in agricultural years). It is still grappling with issues of stylistic identity as well as with current economic realities. Bierzo estates have come and gone in the American marketplace, where consumers have perhaps gravitated more to the more delicate wines of Ribeira Sacra, also made primarily of mencía across the border in Galicia.        
While these bigger issues remain, we were more concerned with the basic winemaking issue of balance. We certainly encountered wines that we liked very much, but we were also struck by the number of wines that did not seem to conform to that axiomatic definition of a good wine. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Gil Avital, the wine director at Tertulia in Greenwich Village, and Jill Roberts, wine director of the Marrow in the West Village.        
How do you perceive balance? Partly, you can sense it when each individual element in a wine (fruit, tannins, alcohol and acidity) is in proportion so that no one element dominates or is noticeable by its absence.        
But balance has a figurative element as well. A truly balanced wine will have tension and energy, as with German rieslings that walk a tightrope between cloying sweetness and mouth-parching acidity, thrilling as they teeter back and forth, or great Champagnes that crackle with a vivacity that demands another sip.        
The flavors of a wine must also be in balance, as with the push-pull between bitter and sweet so typical of many Italian reds. This, in particular, was where we found too many of the Bierzo wines in our tasting falling short. We loved the aromatic fruitiness of these wines, but quite a few showed an off-putting bitter quality that was out of proportion to the other elements.        
What may have caused such a disjointedness? I can only speculate, but I would guess that either the grapes were not properly ripe at harvest, or the wine was overworked in the cellar, as producers tried to manipulate or eke out of the wine more intensity than it had to offer.        
“It really depends on where mencía grows,” Gil said. “It’s got to have balance, but it’s hard to handle properly, like pinot noir.”        
Though we were perhaps more aware of the misses, our tasting had its hits as well, like our No. 1 wine, the 2010 Vico from Raúl Pérez. Mr. Pérez is one of the superstar winemakers in northwestern Spain, and his wines always show great purity and definition. This wine was burlier than his more graceful Ribeira Sacra wines, an excellent example of mencía made in a slightly warmer climate, with fruit flavors buttressed by mineral and oak accents. Yes, it was beautifully balanced, and it will reward a few more years of aging. At $35, this was one of Mr. Pérez’s more modestly priced wines. Other cuvées can soar past $90 or $100.

DAKAR, Senegal — Oil is being stolen on an “industrial scale” in Nigeria, the world’s 13th largest producer, and the country’s politicians and security officials are among those profiting, according to a new report from a prominent British research group.        


Thieves steal an estimated average of 100,000 barrels a day, the report said; working in elaborate networks and protected by corrupted security officials, they tap into the huge and isolated network of pipes that crisscross the country’s swampy southern Niger Delta region. The price of oil fluctuates, but a hypothetical per-barrel price of $100 would mean an annual loss of $3.65 billion. Oil closed at $107.28 per barrel on Thursday.        
Much of this oil winds up being exported globally, said the report, which was released Thursday by the London-based organization Chatham House. The problem has reached such proportions that major oil companies operating in Nigeria have recently complained that theft is cutting significantly into production.        
A similar report last year, commissioned by the Nigerian government but largely ignored, said that over the preceding decade, thieves had been stealing 6 percent to 30 percent of the country’s daily production. “Hydrocarbon theft is a major source of loss of revenue to the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” said that report, prepared by the country’s former top anticorruption official, Nuhu Ribadu. It described the problem then as an “emergency.”        
The full extent of the country’s larcenous ingenuity is on display in the oil thievery. There is “theft from tank farms, refinery storage tanks, jetties and ports,” according to the Nigerian report. “Officials and private actors disguise theft through manipulation of meters and shipping documents.”        
Small-scale pipeline tapping operations can easily be detected in short daytime trips into the swamps from the Niger Delta’s population centers. Telltale plumes of smoke from illegal refining operations rise above the water.        
But more significant “bunkering,” as oil theft is known here, involves siphoning oil from pipes on land or underwater, loading it onto small barges, then transferring it to bigger barges offshore in the Gulf of Guinea. Sometimes thieves use pipes up to 12 inches in diameter to tap the lines, according to Chatham House. Sometimes crude is stolen from export terminals.        
The Chatham House report underscored profiteering at high levels.        
“Top Nigerian officials cut their teeth in the oil theft business during military rule,” it said. “Over time, evidence surfaced that corrupt members of the security forces were actively involved. The country’s return to democracy in 1999 then gave some civilian officials and political ‘godfathers’ more access to stolen oil.” Security officials are said to extort payments from the oil thieves in return for protection, according to Chatham House.        
The Chatham House report suggested that high oil prices have contributed to the incentive to steal. But it was inconclusive on the question of how much of the stolen crude was exported, and how much was processed in operations in the Nigerian swamps. “The bush refining business is highly decentralized and secretive,” it said, “which makes its size hard to estimate.”        
Mr. Ribadu’s report gave a higher possible figure for the scale of daily theft — 250,000 barrels — but the Chatham House document emphasized the unreliability of figures from government and oil companies. Mr. Ribadu suggested, in stronger terms than the more recent document, that the problem is growing, noting that Shell claimed a fivefold increase in losses between 2009 and 2012, from 10,000 barrels per day to 50,000 in March of last year.        
Chatham House, by contrast, said that “outsiders should look closely at claims that Nigeria is losing oil at unheard-of rates,” adding that “the high divergence in industrywide estimates makes it hard to gauge trends reliably.”

No American president was more improbable than Thomas Woodrow Wilson. None better embodied how we like to think of ourselves in the greater world.        


A Princeton University president and political economy professor given to making high-minded speeches and advocating a parliamentary system, Wilson held no public office until he was 54 years old. Recruited to run for governor of New Jersey in 1910 by a Democratic machine boss who thought he would be easily controlled, the prof schooled the pro in practical politics, passing a reform agenda that curbed the power of parties and corporations alike. “After dealing with college politicians,” he gibed, “I find that the men with whom I am dealing with now seem like amateurs.”        
Adroitly riding the progressive wave breaking over the country, Wilson took the presidency two years later, only the second Democrat to capture the White House since the Civil War. He possessed a rare instinct for power and how to use it. Once in Washington he put his theories to the test, audaciously choosing to rule more as a prime minister than a traditional chief executive. Within 10 months he had passed a progressive agenda that had been stalled for a generation, slashing tariff rates that protected monopolies, passing the first permanent federal income tax and creating the Federal Reserve system to end the bank panics that continually ravaged the American economy. More reforms — to bolster antitrust laws, discourage child labor and inaugurate the eight-hour day and workers’ compensation — followed.        
Handsome and charismatic, Wilson was our first modern president, holding regular news conferences, complaining about having to live in Washington and delighting in popular distractions like baseball games, detective stories, golf and especially the new moving pictures. He adored women and had remarkably modern partnerships with them, sharing every aspect of his work and his ideas with his wife, Ellen, and, after she died, with his second wife, Edith. He also had a longtime — and apparently platonic — female friend.        
A. Scott Berg tells the story of Wilson, the man, very well indeed. The author of four previous prizewinning, best-selling biographies, he has a novelist’s eye for the striking detail, and a vivid prose style.        
He is on less sure footing when it comes to Wilson, the statesman. Too often, he relies on shoddy sources that distort the historical record. The Black Death recurred frequently, but it did not last for 400 years. Henry Cabot Lodge was not a right-­winger, the Royal Navy did not take “a timorous approach” to German U-boats and Winston Churchill did not believe that “America should have minded its own business and stayed out of the world war.”        
Berg gives us little on the vital economic debates of the Progressive Era, and only a perfunctory comparison of Wilson’s “New Freedom” and Teddy Roosevelt’s “New Nationalism.” There is barely a mention of the Pujo committee’s investigations into our financial system, which made many of Wilson’s reforms possible, and no attempt to assess the long-term effects of these reforms.        
He does better on issues like women’s rights and especially race. Wilson, a Virginia native steeped in the lore of the “Lost Cause,” stuffed his cabinet full of bigoted Southern mediocrities, who cruelly segregated federal offices, cafeterias and washrooms for the first time. When a black journalist and Wilson supporter, William Monroe Trotter, protested too persistently, the president ordered him out of his office.        
Both his temper and his injudicious selection of advisers were indicative of flaws that would come to devour his presidency. Wilson attracted some of the most talented figures in American political history to his administration and his causes — Franklin Roosevelt, Louis Brandeis, Herbert Hoover, Walter Lippmann and Bernard Baruch, among others — but too often he failed to delegate well, routinely writing his own speeches and even typing his own policy papers. Absolute loyalty was valued over candor. Again and again, Wilson broke with his closest associates when he felt they had betrayed him.

MINNEAPOLIS — It promises to be a bizarre scene.        


On Friday evening, the Minnesota Orchestra will hold a fund-raising ball in Orchestra Hall, which is just reopening after renovations costing some $50 million. Besides acoustical improvements intended to help musicians hear one another better onstage and expanded facilities for the players backstage, the face-lift includes a large and attractive new lobby that the orchestra and renters of the hall will be able to use to entertain patrons.        
From an upper level on Friday, wealthy donors will look out at the skyline through an array of floor-to-ceiling windows. And at street level, they will look out at a demonstration through a low-slung row of windows extending the length of the facade: a rally by supporters of the orchestra’s players, who have been locked out of their jobs for almost a year, protesting the musicians’ treatment by the orchestra’s management and board.        
Such, at least, was the prospect held up by the players at a concert they arranged on their own at the Lake Harriet Band Shell here on Sunday.        
For the players, who have rejected two proposed contracts — one that would have cut their salaries by a third, another by a quarter — the lobby itself, costing some $30 million, has become a symbol. Though money was raised specifically for the renovation project, the players cast the lobby expenditure as a misappropriation of funds that might better be directed toward their remuneration and welfare.        
The lockout, which began last Oct. 1 and wiped out an entire season of concerts, now jeopardizes the start of another, which is to include four concerts of Sibelius at Carnegie Hall conducted by Osmo Vanska, the orchestra’s music director. It also jeopardizes Mr. Vanska’s tenure, since he has threatened to resign if the first two Carnegie concerts, in early November, are canceled.        
He has said that to prepare adequately for the new season and for the Carnegie concerts, the players will have to be rehearsing by Sept. 30. The administration said that for that to happen, the players would have to have agreed to a new contract by last Sunday.        
That deadline has now been extended, day to day through most of a week, as both sides continue to work with a mediator, George J. Mitchell, the former senator from Maine who is also a seasoned diplomat, though not necessarily where unions are involved. The orchestra’s season, the Carnegie concerts and Mr. Vanska’s tenure continue to hang in the balance.        
Is this a time for a gala celebration, fund-raiser or not?        
“The ball raises $1 million,” said Michael Henson, the orchestra’s president and chief executive. “If we canceled it, we’d be $1 million worse off.”        
The players are planning a fall season of their own, beginning with concerts on Oct. 4 and 5 featuring the pianist Emanuel Ax, according to their Web site. What is more, said their spokesman, Blois Olson, there has been “soft interest” from unspecified quarters in the notion of having the players stage their own Sibelius concerts with Mr. Vanska at Carnegie, free of management involvement, as unlikely as that may seem.

MAGDEBURG, Germany — When Chancellor Angela Merkel made an hourlong campaign stop in this town in the former East Germany this week, Ilse Siegert was determined not to miss her chance.        


A descendant of an impoverished noble family who landed here in the chaos of 1945, Ms. Siegert, 74, has seen her share of German history. For more than a decade, she has campaigned for better benefits for retirees and others she thinks are not getting their fair share from the German state. So, she said, she buttonholed Ms. Merkel as she worked the crowd of about 1,500 on Tuesday and demanded to know what the chancellor planned to do about the issue. Ms. Merkel shook her hand and smiled, she said.        
“Before the election, they all want to know us,” Ms. Siegert said. “After the election, no one knows us at all.”        
She said she might vote for Ms. Merkel on Sunday, when the chancellor hopes to win a third term, but was still considering shunning the election altogether.        
Ms. Merkel, 59, a trained physicist, spent her first 35 years in the Communist East, so she may be considered “one of us” in these parts of Germany by the political and other elites who like to talk, at least publicly, of the blossoming “new states.” But she may also have an uphill battle to win over eastern Germans who feel shortchanged by capitalism nearly a quarter-century after the fall of the Berlin Wall.        
Parts of the former East, particularly southern regions around Leipzig and Dresden, have flourished. But in places like Magdeburg, a 1,000-year-old town with Germany’s oldest Gothic cathedral, a renowned university and some very Soviet-looking buildings that replaced bombed ruins left by the Allies, the present and future look less gleaming.        
In more than a dozen conversations a visitor had with older residents at Ms. Merkel’s campaign stop, at Old Market Square, talk turned quickly to their too-meager pensions, and among younger spectators to their abiding indifference toward the chancellor.        
Wages in the former East still tend to be lower than in the former West, and while pensions have evened out, many Easterners, reared on illusory views of Western bounty, still feel cheated.        
Those who had lived in the West before the wall fell rarely grouse much anymore about how much reunification cost — estimates run around $2.7 trillion — although some note occasionally that while the living conditions of East Germans may have been miserable, most went along with Communist rule for four decades.        
Eastern Germany has far fewer people, and votes, to offer than the West, but with polls showing the race tightening in its final days, Ms. Merkel found time to make her case here, with her usual stump speech modified in an effort to appeal. “We have no votes to give away,” she emphasized, possibly the same thought that led her to visit  Magdeburg and surrounding towns after catastrophic floods this summer.        
Political loyalties in the former East Germany, with a population of roughly 15.5 million, were split in the last federal elections, in 2009, between Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats, who won slightly less than 30 percent of the vote, and the far-left Die Linke, which got just under 29 percent. The center-left Social Democrats, the No. 2 party nationally, came in a distant third with 18 percent.        
Peer Steinbrück, the Social Democrat who is Ms. Merkel’s main challenger, caused a stir in August when he accused her of lacking an emotional affinity for Europe, something he attributed to her East German background. Mr. Steinbrück swiftly denied any intent to impugn all East Germans, whom he called “hardworking, enterprising people.”        
But the backtracking failed to convince some, including Werner Schulz, a European Parliament member who was in Germany’s Parliament for 15 years and a human rights activist in East Germany. Someone who spoke like Mr. Steinbrück was not worthy of becoming chancellor, Mr. Schulz said.        
Some of the warmest applause Ms. Merkel received from the crowd on Tuesday came when she praised Europe as a place in which freedom of speech, religion, the media and association are guaranteed. The line — a stump speech staple — resonated more here than in the West, and to whistling hecklers she added the zinger that, yes, even in Magdeburg, there was no price to pay for disagreeing with her.

Another Italian restaurant? Well, yes and no. Bianco Rosso Wine Bar and Restaurant in Wilton, which opened in January 2012, does indeed serve Italian food. But Bianco Rosso is not just another Italian restaurant. It has style, flair and a short, compelling menu devised by Jacob Hamilton, the chef, who formerly worked for Todd English in New York. It is owned by two brothers, Mario and Jaime Lopez, and their partner Gustavo Jaramillo.        


The dining room, which runs the length of the building and seats 70, is stylish, too, with crystal chandeliers with gauzy red shades, a wood floor and a communal table in the center.        
The really big deal is the two-course prix fixe lunch for $15, an excellent value. There are six starter choices and seven entrees; they sounded intriguing, and those we tried were prettily plated and generally very good.        
Tops for creativity was an appetizer of king salmon tartare. A generous stack of chopped fresh salmon speckled with shallots and fiery jalapeños rested on a bed of arugula, with both black and pink peppercorns scattered on the plate — a most attractive presentation.        
Crunchy fried calamari, another starter, is served in abundance, along with a mildly spiced marinara dip. Eggplant Parmesan with prosciutto and mascarpone sounded lovely. But the reality was not as fresh-tasting or as exhilarating as the other starters.        
As for the prix fixe entrees, we loved the radiant freshness of the house-made pea tortellini — four or five pasta pillows filled with sweet peas, cooked in brown butter with a tang of honey, on a plate decorated with fresh pea shoots and tendrils.        
Another pasta dish, fusilli, combined roasted cauliflower, garlic and olive oil, and radiated tantalizing aromas. It tasted as good as it looked, but it needed more olive oil (which our waiter willingly supplied) to moisten and enliven the dish.        
We also enjoyed the pan-seared shrimp — succulent jumbos, in a swirl of lobster sauce and accompanied by a barley salad with peas, mushrooms and carrots.        
The pan-seared striped bass, on the other hand, was a bit overcooked for my taste. It was teamed, however, with a refreshing barley-asparagus salad, jazzed up with a tangy lemon vinaigrette.        
The regular à la carte dinner menu also has some very good choices, generally well prepared. Our dinner began with excellent crusty focaccia, served gratis with first-rate Aria extra virgin olive oil that had a few beads of olive tapenade floating in it.        
Among the first courses, we loved the piping-hot grilled squid (exceedingly tender and fresh-tasting) with white cannellini beans and cherry tomatoes, anchored in a luscious herb-rich sauce. Equally pleasing was the nicely browned, crunchy-topped crab cake, made with Maryland lump crab meat, which came alongside a flawlessly dressed arugula salad with fresh tomatoes and a zesty cherry pepper sauce.        
Crispy artichokes were another delight, though the dressing on the accompanying green salad could have benefited from a touch more vinegar.        
An entree of baked salmon arrived with an engaging potpourri of veggies (peas, green beans, lima beans, asparagus, carrots, spring onions and radishes). Another dish, pan-seared red snapper, was plated with a crisp risotto cake, tomato ragù, mussels, olives, spinach and smoked sweet paprika oil. Both fish orders were expertly cooked.        
Desserts are few, but two of those we tried were noteworthy: a warm, brown-sugary apple cobbler and tiramisù. The pistachio gelato was, to my taste, a tad too sweet.        
Lunch is the big value here, but dinner can be festive — and delicious. With most à la carte entrees topping out in the low to mid-20s, Bianco Rosso offers impressive cooking at modest prices.

“Doctor Sleep” is Stephen King’s latest novel, and it’s a very good specimen of the quintessential King blend. According to Vladimir Nabokov, Salvador Dalí was “really Norman Rockwell’s twin brother kidnapped by gypsies in babyhood.” But actually there were triplets: the third one is Stephen King.        


The Rockwell small-town rocking chair, the old-fashioned house with the welcome mat, the genial family doctor, the grandfather clock: there they are, depicted in all their lifelike, apparently cozy detail. Both Rockwell and King know such details intimately, right down to the brand names. But there’s something very, very wrong. The rocking chair is coming to get you. The family doctor is greenish in hue and has been dead for some time. The house is haunted, and the welcome mat is alive with things. And, pace Dalí, the clock is melting.        
“Doctor Sleep” picks up on the story of Danny, the little boy with psycho-intuitive powers in King’s famous 1977 novel, “The Shining.” Danny survived both his evil-infested dad, Jack Torrance, and the ghouls that inhabited the grisly Overlook Hotel in Colorado, escaping by the hair of his chinny-chin-chin just before the clock struck midnight and the hotel’s infernal boiler blew up, incinerating the forces of bad and leaving readers hiding under the bed, but cross-eyed with relief.        
In “Doctor Sleep” Dan has grown up, but he retains his “shining” abilities. Having wrestled the demon drink to an uneasy standstill — his father had that problem too, as we recall — he’s attending A.A. and working at a hospice facility, where, with his mind-probing talents, he helps the dying to reconcile themselves to their often misspent lives. Thus his nickname, Doctor Sleep, which echoes his childhood nickname, “doc.” (As in the “What’s up?” of Bugs Bunny fame. What, indeed?)        
Enter another magic child, Abra — as in “cadabra,” the text helpfully points out — who’s even better at the shining stuff than Dan is. She alarmed her parents early on by predicting the 9/11 disaster while still in her crib, and has since caused dismay by sticking all the spoons to the ceiling during her birthday party.        
The two shiners soon find themselves in spiritual communication, which is a lucky thing, because young Abra is going to need big help. She is the target of a rackety, entertaining bunch called the True Knot, who lust to drink her spiritual mist, or “steam.” (This is a whole new twist on steampunk.) The Knot members have been alive for a Very Long Time — not usually a good sign, as those who know their “Dracula” and “She” can testify — and, disguised as vacationers roaming the countryside in RVs, they kidnap and torture their victims, then imbibe their essences. They also bottle these in case of shortages; for if they run out of steam they evaporate, leaving their clothes behind, like the Wicked Witch of the West when melted.        
They’re led by a beautiful woman named Rose the Hat, whose main lover is a gent known as Crow Daddy. (From “crawdaddy,” we assume. King loves wordplay and puns and mirror language: remember redrum, from “The Shining”? Who could forget?) The names of King’s characters are frequently appropriate: Daniel “Lions’ Den” Anthony (the tempted saint) Torrance (it never rains but it pours) is a case in point. Rose is a sinister Rosa Mystica, a negative version of the Virgin Mary. (For starters, she ain’t no virgin.)        
As for the Overlook Hotel — on the site of which the True Knotters have pitched their main encampment — its name has at least three layers: the obvious one (it looks out over the landscape), the semi-obvious (the bad folks overlook something) and the deeply embedded, which I’m guessing has to do with the old song about the four-leaf clover and the somebody I adore; for King’s good-and-evil arrangement is usually yin and yang, with a spot of darkness in every goodie and a tiny ray of sunshine in every baddie. Even the True Knotters are sweet with one another, though their status as human beings is dubious. As one new recruit says, “Am I still human?” And as Rose replies, “Do you care?”        
Wild ectoplasmic partly decayed vampire horses would not tear from me the story of what happens next, but let me assure you King is a pro: by the end of this book your fingers will be mere stubs of their former selves, and you will be looking askance at the people in the supermarket line, because if they turn around they might have metallic eyes. King’s inventiveness and skill show no signs of slacking: “Doctor Sleep” has all the virtues of his best work.

                            Feisty young women chasing around Sweden tracking down killers are by no means the only people with dragons tattooed on their flesh. The middle-aged French-Canadian gallery owner at the center of Robert Lepage’s slight but moving work “The Blue Dragon,” at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Harvey Theater through Sunday, has a similar creature snaking across his back, an emblem of his reverence for Chinese culture and his adopted home.        


                            Mr. Lepage, most famous (or is that infamous?) in New York now for his controversial and expensive production of Wagner’s “Ring” for the Metropolitan Opera, has a long career behind him as a theater auteur — he writes, directs and sometimes acts in productions for his Ex Machina company. “The Blue Dragon,” originally staged in 2009, is a smaller-scaled sequel of sorts to his more epic, five-hour-plus “Dragons’ Trilogy” from 1985. (This show runs an intermissionless hour and 50 minutes, and is performed in English, French and Mandarin, with English supertitles.)        

                            Mr. Lepage portrays Pierre Lamontagne, a central figure in “The Dragons’ Trilogy,” whose life is taken up 20 years after the end of that work. Pierre has left Canada behind to forge a life in Shanghai as a gallery owner, his ambitions to create art of his own having been set aside. His affair with a young Chinese artist whose show he is presenting, Xiao Ling (Tai Wei Foo), hits a rough patch when a lover from his past, Claire Forêt (Marie Michaud), arrives in Shanghai on a quest to adopt a baby.        

                            Claire and Pierre have reached points in their lives at which decisions made in their youth are circling back to haunt them, and at which decisions made now can involve momentous, irreversible change. Claire, too, has left the art world to become an advertising executive, but now sees the shelf life of her career shortening before her, as younger colleagues keep apace with the disorienting changes in media and culture.        

                            Pierre’s life has suddenly become precarious: the Chinese authorities are planning to “expropriate” the property where he has long lived, along with many other artists, to build a train station. Both Mr. Lepage and Ms. Michaud, who together wrote the script for “The Blue Dragon,” give subdued, delicate and emotionally resonant performances. We sense quickly how easily Pierre and Claire re-establish their rapport, while the question of what might have been between them — they married for mercenary purposes, to gain more grant money and never divorced — lingers quietly in the background, like music just faintly heard.        

                            When Claire’s bid to adopt goes awry, she feels herself even more at loose ends, but she strikes up a friendship with Xiao Ling that leads to an unexpected development. Xiao Ling has become pregnant, they discover one day when an expedition to the zoo is interrupted by a bout of morning sickness. Chinese cultural dictates make it difficult for single women to raise children on their own. Could her unwanted baby be a stroke of happy fortune for Claire?        

                            “The Blue Dragon” moves with the cinematic fluidity emblematic of much of Mr. Lepage’s work. I kept reflecting that the production seems almost designed for film. It opens with movie-style credits, during which Ms. Tai dances in traditional costume before the screen on which the credits appear. And the action is mostly confined to a narrow, two-level strip of stage that gives the show a kind of two-dimensional feeling, as if we were watching the whole thing unfold on a screen.        

                            Film might also amplify the impact of the performances. Aside from a single scene of conflict, in which Pierre and Claire trade recriminations and accusations after a tense night, “The Blue Dragon” relies on minor-key emotional developments that the actors, to their credit, never overplay, but that don’t necessarily register strongly enough to engage an audience in a large theater. I had the odd feeling that I was watching a quiet, finely etched indie movie on an iPhone, and losing too much of the detail.        

                            Mr. Lepage does supply some nifty directorial sleight-of-hand, as when two white sheets slide slowly across the stage to indicate a thin layer of snowfall. And, as always, his integration of video imagery (by David Leclerc) is seamless and sometimes witty. One interstitial segment appears to be an old-style Chinese martial arts movie set in the legendary past, until patties of fried chicken appear in the hands of the warriors: it’s a Chinese ad for KFC.        

                            “The Blue Dragon” ends on a movingly ambiguous note. Earlier Xiao Ling told Claire the grim legend of how women with unwanted babies once disposed of them by throwing them into the Yangtze River and letting the three gorges decide their fate: a new family, death by drowning or a return to the place where they were abandoned.        

                            Evoking this legend, Mr. Lepage and Ms. Michaud conclude the show by offering three provisional endings, all plausible and rewarding on their own terms, but each leaving one of the three characters waving a bittersweet goodbye to the other two, suggesting that whatever the future holds, someone will end up abandoned and alone.

SAN FRANCISCO — Kids. The reckless rants and pictures they post online can often get them in trouble, by compromising their chances of getting into a good college or even landing them in jail. What to do about such lapses vexes parents, school officials, the Internet companies that host their words and images — and the law.        


Now California legislators are trying to solve the problem with the first measure in the country to give minors the legal right to scrub away their online indiscretions. The legislation puts the state in the middle of a turbulent debate over how best to protect children and their privacy on the Internet, and whether states should even be trying to tame the Web.        
The governor, Jerry Brown, has taken no position on the bill. He has until mid-October to sign it, after which, without his signature, the legislation becomes law.        
California is often in the vanguard when it comes to digital privacy. It was the first state to require companies to report data breaches, and it requires Web sites and mobile apps to post privacy policies that explain how personal information is used. A recently passed law requires Web sites to tell users whether they honor browsers’ do-not-track signals.        
The right-to-delete, or eraser, provision is part of a broader bill that prohibits Web sites, which have “actual knowledge” that a minor is using the site based on a profile and activity on the site, from running ads for a range of products — including alcohol, spray paint, tattoos, tanning beds and e-cigarettes. The eraser section compels online sites to let users under 18 delete rants, tweets, pictures, status updates and other material.        
Although many companies, including Facebook and Twitter, already offer this option to their users, the California bill would make it a right across the Internet for children who live in that state.        
“Kids and teenagers often self-reveal before they self-reflect,” said James Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a San Francisco-based advocacy group that pushed for the law. “It’s a very important milestone.”        
The rash revelations by a Texas teenager, Justin Carter, on Facebook last February — a threatened school shooting his family insists was sarcastic, made in the heat of playing a video game — landed him in a Texas jail on a felony terrorism charge for nearly six months. His father, Jack, favors the California legislation, but wonders if it would go far enough.        
“They should be allowed to delete it, but then again is it really deleted?” Mr. Carter, 39, of San Antonio, said in an interview this week.        
Also, Mr. Carter said, if his son had deleted the conversation that someone reported to the authorities, would the deletion be seen as destroying evidence?        
His son, now 19, is out on a bond, pending trial. Any law trying to tame the Internet, he said, is likely to run into turbulence.        
“It’s a whole new territory, it grew faster than the laws did,” Mr. Carter said. “We’re trying to come up with things to make it all neat. There’s collateral damage — my son being one of them.”        
Critics of an eraser law see pitfalls. They warn that in trying to protect children, the law could unwittingly put them at risk by digging deeper into their personal lives. To comply with the law, for example, companies would have to collect more information about their customers, including whether they are under 18 and whether they are in California.        
There are also practical concerns. If other states pass similar laws, companies would be forced to devise multiple policies for the underage residents of different states — confusing consumers and creating unwieldy requirements for Web businesses that are essentially stateless, except for issues like collecting sales tax. The Internet, opponents of the law say, should be regulated by a uniform set of rules, not piecemeal by the states.        
“This is well-meaning legislation but there are concerns about it,” said Stephen Balkam, president of the Family Online Safety Institute, which advises companies like Facebook and Microsoft on online safety issues.        
Mr. Balkam said he favored Congressional oversight in issues like children’s online privacy and, if necessary, regulation by the Federal Trade Commission. “Where California leads, others follow,” he said. “I think it will be a mess.”        
Some supporters of the bill say Internet companies got off easy. The eraser bill does not, for example, require companies to remove the deleted data from its servers altogether, nor does it offer any way to delete material that has been shared by others; a sensational picture that has gone viral, in other words, can’t be purged from the Internet.        
And it is nothing like the right-to-be-forgotten measure that legislators in Europe have been pressing for. That proposal would, at its core, allow all Europeans, not just children, to delete their online personal information; several amendments to the plan address freedom of expression concerns.        
“It’s an important first step, but there’s more to be done,” Mr. Steyer said.        
Mr. Steyer’s organization, which participated in a safety advisory group with Facebook but soon left after disagreements with the company’s approach, has been pushing for more aggressive legislation. Those efforts in 2011 led members of Congress to propose a measure that would have allowed parents to scrub material posted by their children. Criticized by free speech advocates, the bill went nowhere, though Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who was a co-sponsor, plans to introduce it again later this year.        
Short of federal privacy laws in general, states have been passing laws on a host of privacy matters, in many cases following California’s lead.        
“Often you need to comply with the most restrictive state as a practical matter because the Internet doesn’t really have state boundaries,” said Mali Friedman, a lawyer in the San Francisco office of Covington & Burling, a national law firm.

Bank regulators around the world are forcing banks to hold more capital than they did before the financial crisis revealed just how inadequate their capital truly was. But one set of American banks appears to be on the verge of keeping the right to have no capital at all.        


That group is the money market funds, which function as banks but historically have had the best of all regulatory worlds: no capital requirements, no reserves, no fees for deposit insurance and a belief by their customers that they were at least as safe as banks.        
This week the comment period closed on proposed money market rules set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The rules are pitifully weak and inadequate. They could even make the system more vulnerable in a crisis, as the presidents of all 12 Federal Reserve banks pointed out in a letter to the S.E.C.        
But that has not stopped the mutual fund industry from trying to weaken them even more.        
By coincidence, the deadline for comments was on Thursday, just five days after the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. It was that collapse that revealed to all just how shaky the money market industry was.        
The answer is — or ought to be — remarkably simple:        
“They either have to be banks or mutual funds,” Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, told me in an interview. “If they are banks, promising to pay at par on demand, they should be regulated like banks. If they are mutual funds, they should be regulated like mutual funds.”        
But such a sensible proposal would outrage the money market fund industry, which has lobbied politicians intensely.        
It was perhaps the biggest embarrassment of Mary Schapiro’s tenure as chairwoman of the S.E.C. that she was unable to persuade a majority of commissioners to propose any reform of the industry. So her successor, Mary Jo White, was praised when she managed to get the commission to unanimously put out the two rules for comment. Surely, something was better than nothing.        
Well, in this case, perhaps not.        
One proposed rule calls for allowing the net asset value of money market funds to fluctuate. Currently, funds price their shares at $1, rounded to the nearest penny, and promise they will remain there. In practice, that means that as long as the value remains at or above 99.5 cents, the fund will not break the buck.        
The S.E.C. proposal would stretch that rounding out to the nearest hundredth of a penny.        
But the S.E.C. proposal would not actually do very much. Funds that invest primarily in government securities would not face a floating net asset value. Nor would so-called retail money market funds, which allow investors to withdraw no more than $1 million at a time. Even those few funds that would be subject to the rule would be able to use an existing S.E.C. rule that usually lets them assume market prices are equal to par value for any security that will mature within 60 days.        
The fact that the proposal would do little has not stopped the industry from complaining. Fund companies want to change the definition of “retail” fund. Some suggest raising the limit to $5 million. Others say that as long as the investor has a Social Security number, the fund should be deemed retail.        
The other S.E.C. proposal sets up an elaborate procedure that would allow — but not require — money market funds that have experienced a lot of redemptions to either impose a fee on redemptions or to simply suspend such payments for 30 days. This is called the “gating” proposal because it erects gates to protect funds.        
And what is the virtue of that? Well, it would prevent, or at least delay, a run on any fund that got in trouble. If protecting the fund, and not its investors, is the top priority, maybe that makes sense.        
But in reality, it probably would do more harm than good. As Eric S. Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston wrote in a letter signed by all the other regional Fed presidents, a fund could run low on liquidity — and thus initiate the gating proposal — if a couple of large investors in the fund withdrew their money for any reason. That could scare investors in other funds that seemed similar in some way, producing more runs and more gates. “As this represents a new run mechanism that does not exist under the status quo, the fees-and-gates alternative may actually increase run risk relative to not enacting further reform,” Mr. Rosengren wrote.        
To much of the industry, there is no problem at all. What happened in a 2008 was a “once-in-a-generation scenario” that is unlikely to recur, as a lawyer for one money-market fund group, Federated Investors, put it in a comment letter. Any further reform, he added, “should be designed to preserve the utility” of money market funds.

In the not-so-distant past, the recently opened SubCulture, an intimate subterranean space with a bar, cinema-style seats with cup holders and a purple-lighted brick wall framing the piano, might have seemed an unlikely site for classical music concerts.        


But SubCulture, a stylish multigenre performance space underneath the Culture Project on Bleecker Street, is the latest in a growing number of quirky additions to the New York classical scene, off-the-beaten-track halls where concerts of fledgling and mainstream soloists and ensembles increasingly take place. In a very short time the nightclub Le Poisson Rouge, also on Bleecker Street, has become a regular haunt for prominent musicians and fledging groups. (Unlike Le Poisson Rouge, SubCulture doesn’t serve food or drinks during performances.)        
On Tuesday evening, Shai Wosner opened a two-week piano festival at SubCulture, featuring mostly jazz musicians. Later this fall, the 92nd Street Y will present several concerts at SubCulture, including a program for guitar and accordion on Oct. 8. The New York Philharmonic and the Y will organize three programs at SubCulture as part of Contact!, the orchestra’s new-music series.        
Mr. Wosner, a young Israeli-born pianist, has been focusing on Schubert in recent seasons; along with several recitals he has demonstrated his mettle with an all-Schubert disc on the Onyx label. And Schubert was the theme of the evening here, beginning with the Klavierstück in E flat minor (D. 946, No. 1), enhanced by Mr. Wosner’s delicate, graceful pianissimos and lithe touch. He barely paused at the end of the piece before beginning Jörg Widmann’s “Idyll and Abyss: Six Schubert Reminiscences,” a series of brief, witty and whimsical miniatures with titles like “Unreal, as if from afar” and “Mournful, desolate.”        
Mr. Widmann filters Schubertian language and gestures through a contemporary prism, complete with quirky harmonies and whistling. In the final movement, he quotes an opening phrase of Schubert’s Sonata in B flat (D. 960), which concluded the intermission-less program.        
I enjoyed Mr. Wosner’s interpretation of the sonata’s first movement the most. His playing was imbued with distinctive (but not eccentric) ideas and an arresting tension and momentum.        
For the encores, he offered Schubert’s Hungarian Melody in B minor (D. 817) and his own gentle, Schubert-inspired improvisation.

Before “The Metamorphosis,” Arthur Pita’s dance-theater adaptation of Franz Kafka’s novella, officially begins, the stage tells a story. On one side is a kitchen where a mother dries silverware, a father hunches over a newspaper and a pigtailed daughter lies on the floor checking her homework. On the other is Edward Watson, recumbent in bed with a white sheet pulled up to his chest. Eerily, his body seems trapped. Even as he lifts his head off the pillow and slowly rolls it side to side, he remains otherwise still.        


In “The Metamorphosis,” which was seen Wednesday at the Joyce Theater, a traveling salesman wakes up to find that he has been transformed into a gruesome insect. Like Kafka’s character, Mr. Watson’s Gregor Samsa is oddly matter-of-fact about his predicament; he also never completely parts with his humanity even as his parents and eventually Grete, his young sister, accept the transformation with equal parts acceptance and revulsion.        
Set to an ominous score by Frank Moon, who can go overboard with his insect-in-the-night vocalizations, “The Metamorphosis” features impressive visual design: Simon Daw’s set, which features a moving wall, contrasts between the grotesque creature with its sterile surroundings. Dark-brown sludge seeps out of Gregor’s mouth, eventually turning his bedroom into a streaky mudslide that conjures a blood-soaked Carrie.        
If only there were more tension in Mr. Pita’s increasingly long-winded production, which opened the Joyce Theater’s fall season and was originally produced by the Royal Ballet in 2011. Much care is devoted to Gregor’s pre-insect existence, in which his routine is established: he rises from bed, dresses, puts an apple in his bag and catches a train. Here, Mr. Watson’s precision is unflinching. But the transformation from salesman to insect is more abrupt than macabre. Even worse is the sense that this insect has studied yoga. It doesn’t matter what a pair of long legs are doing; there is still no place in “The Metamorphosis” for a shoulder stand.        
Still, Mr. Watson, a celebrated Royal Ballet principal, possesses a spindly ranginess that is affecting, especially as he uses his joints to etch razor-sharp angles. Rolling on his back, he extends his legs in the air and points and flexes his toes. Threading an arm in between his thighs and wrapping it around the outside of his calf, he curves his spine in a deep contraction without losing his strange, defining prickliness.        
Duets with his mother (Nina Goldman) and Grete (Corey Annand) are more obvious; often, they expose little more than partnering mechanics. Grete — an aspiring ballerina in this version — struggles to straighten Gregor’s legs and arms, but he is Slinkyesque. There’s no way to stretch him back into a man.        
Mr. Watson’s Gregor has more to do with spirit than the knotting and unknotting of muscles. When it works, the struggle is internal: confusion, yearning and despondency are nakedly revealed in his forlorn eyes. David Hallberg would be good in this, wouldn’t he? For all its predictability, Gregor Samsa is still a meaty role for a ballet dancer; it’s a chance to get down and dirty.        



 
“The Metamorphosis” continues through Sept. 29 at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 242-0800, joyce.org.

                            If you want an interesting perspective on a police procedural, watch it with a real police officer. If you want insights into the accuracy of a medical drama, watch it with a doctor. It’s too bad there are no late-14th- or early-15th-century British kings around with whom to watch “The Hollow Crown,” a four-part serving of Shakespeare that begins on Friday on PBS’s “Great Performances.” Think of the questions you could ask:        


                            “Did you guys really make a habit of spouting eloquent eulogies and speeches at improbable times? Were there really practically no women in England then, except Mrs. Weasley from the Harry Potter movies? Did kings ever do any actual governing, or did they just fight and fret about who was or wasn’t trying to unseat them?”        

                            Of course, your pestering might just earn you a beheading, which seems to have been the method preferred by kings and would-be kings of yore for making annoyances go away. A couple of heads are graphically lopped off in “Richard II,” Friday’s opening installment of the series, which also includes on successive Fridays “Henry IV, Part 1,” “Henry IV, Part 2” and “Henry V.”        

                            Those tumbling heads are worth noting. First, let’s get this caveat out of the way: Nothing beats a stage performance of a Shakespeare play if the cast is first-rate and the direction insightful. That said, a television (or film) treatment can be helpful, especially for the uninitiated, and especially for these plays, which are not as well known or audience-friendly as, say, “Romeo and Juliet.”        

                            When a full battle is called for, you see a battlefield, with horses and armies. When a chorus recitation is demanded, it is recited (by John Hurt) over footage of a ship at sea, embarked on a cross-channel invasion. And when heads must be severed — pity poor Bushy and Green in “Richard II” — the director, Rupert Goold, has the option of showing you the unpleasant act, and he takes it. (Shakespeare had it occur offstage.) There are bloody moments in “The Hollow Crown,” but not gratuitously so. These are high-stakes plays, and graphically rendered deaths underscore that in a way that a stage production can’t.        

                            For the most part, the flexibility that television provides is used to good advantage in “The Hollow Crown” to clarify the action and enhance the dynamics. Only occasionally does it feel misplaced, as in “Richard II,” when Mr. Goold goes all in with Jesus imagery. To have Richard view himself as a Christ figure is fine, but here it seems more the director’s choice than the king’s.        

                            Grouping the four plays together provides the chance for a study in kingly contrasts, and the actors and directors provide it. Jeremy Irons, among the most familiar cast members to American audiences in these British productions, is Henry IV in the middle two plays (directed by Richard Eyre) and gives you pretty much what you’d expect from Mr. Irons: solidity, fury, precision.        

                            Most interesting is Ben Whishaw’s airy, effeminate Richard II, a character who can’t seem to decide whether to be protective of his power or indifferent to it. Richard’s best speeches come late in the play, as he is losing his grip on both reality and his throne to the advancing Henry Bolingbroke (Rory Kinnear, who the next time we meet him has turned into King Henry IV and Mr. Irons).        

                            Prince Hal, eventually to be Henry V, is played by Tom Hiddleston, who ably transitions from the devil-may-care fellow of “Henry IV, Part 1” to the serious monarch of “Henry V” (directed by Thea Sharrock). He may not make anyone forget Kenneth Branagh’s 1989 film portrayal, just as this “Henry V,” as a whole, doesn’t outshine that one, but he has his moments, especially the scene from “Henry IV, Part 1” in which he kills Hotspur and then pronounces one of those incongruously moving spur-of-the-moment epitaphs.        

                            There are characters other than kings in these plays, of course, among them Julie Walters of the Harry Potter films as Mistress Quickly, one of the few female roles of any size. The most beloved is surely Falstaff, and Simon Russell Beale has great fun with the role, making the portly fellow feel like a person rather than a mere buffoon.

Styles,"










A newly engaged couple has had us to dinner at their place a few times. We have lovely meals with wine, then retire to sofas in the living room. At around 10:30 or 11 p.m., the woman cuddles up to her fiancé, pulls a blanket over herself and falls asleep. Meanwhile, the fiancé is happily awake and offers us nightcaps. We feel hugely awkward. My husband is good friends with the guy, and we’d love to stick around and chat, but the sleeping body makes it less enticing. How should we handle this? 


Anonymous, New York 
Leave-taking is the most complicated part of many dinner parties: staying long enough to signal our enjoyment and appreciation, without tipping into that dreaded zone, known to hosts as “How can we miss you if you won’t go away?” A gracious exit is even tougher here, where your hosts are sending mixed signals. His “nightcap?” may suggest, “Don’t move a muscle.” But her rendition of “Sleepy Time Gal” is decidedly (even if unconsciously) screaming, “Enough, already!”        
Simply stand up, and in a quiet voice (so as not to wake Sleeping Beauty), say: “It’s getting late. Let’s pick this up next time.” If the gentleman host is unhappy with the earlier-than-he-desires departure of dinner guests, he will admonish his fiancée (in private, I hope) to keep her eyes open longer. And if your husband has loads more to discuss with his pal, reciprocate quickly. Or let the two of them meet up for lunch.        
But staying put while your hostess is passed out seems irremediably awkward, not to mention creepy. Don’t take her nodding off as any negative judgment about you. She may be tired, especially if she did a full day’s work then cooked a fancy dinner. (And am I the only one who thinks 11 p.m. is pretty late?)        
Learning to socialize with couples takes time: more moving parts. So, if you like these folks, keep at it. In the meantime, here’s your hat, what’s your hurry?        
Identity Crisis 
I have an unusual name that can be intimidating on paper, but is very easy to pronounce, once instructed. I’ve taught people my whole life. But my in-laws (my parents-in-law, brother- and sister-in-law, and now their young children) still do not say it correctly, even though my husband and I have been married for more than a decade. We have tried to correct them, sporadically, over the years, only to be met with, “Are we really saying it that differently?” My feelings have evolved from amused to annoyed and insulted. Am I being oversensitive? 
Anonymous, Newburyport, Mass. 
Of course not. As Jim Croce sang, approximately four million years ago: “Like the pine trees lining the winding road, [you] got a name, [you] got a name.” And your in-laws owe it to you to pronounce it correctly.        
Let’s assume they started out flummoxed by it, which over time turned to fear and denial; and your “sporadic” attempts at remedial education have been insufficient. (This may be kinder than they deserve, but you haven’t sketched out any other cruelties, so we’ll keep to the sunny side of the street.)        
The next time you are all together, sit down with your husband and tell them, “Listen, it’s been a decade, and it’s not that hard a name.” Then do a call-and-response repetition until even the tiniest child can pull it off without a hitch. Go big, and go home a victor. It’s worth the effort. We all learned to pronounce “Zach Galifianakis,” correct?        
Recropping the Photos 
My amazing guy and I have been together for 10 years and married for 2. But his ex-wife continues to package photographs of the “good old days,” including romantic moments between them, and has them delivered by their 20-year-old daughter. He immediately rips them up and throws them out, but I want to let her know that she needs to move on. Any thoughts? 
Anonymous, Vancouver        
Keep quiet about the whole business. It is none of your concern, and your husband is handling it. (And for the record, I would be just as jealous and upset as you.) My only thought is that your husband should not be destroying these photographs, but storing them in the attic or basement. There may come a day when he wants to revisit that period of his life, and it will have no bearing on his love for you.        
Down, Boy! 
I have a dear friend with two large dogs that jump up on me and any other visitor to her home. Even though the dogs are reprimanded, the behavior doesn’t change. Any suggestions? 
Faith, New York 
Speaking for dog owners from the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters, we all know it’s our fault that our dogs jump on you. We were lazy trainers, and you pay the price. Just tell your friend before your next visit that the jumping makes you uncomfortable. I happily put my dog on a leash when fearful or squeamish friends come to call. Your pal won’t mind. She may even feel less guilty about the hash she made of “sit” and “stay.”

RealEstate,"










The Puck Building, the inimitable epicenter of SoHo industrial swank even before there was a SoHo, has been around for 128 years but defies its age with the tenacity of an uptown socialite. All it takes is good bone structure, tons of money and a winning personality — the first supplied by Henry Baerer’s two saucy statues of Shakespeare’s mischievous Puck on the building’s exterior, the last by the genius of the Puck’s original architect, Albert Wagner. The essential contemporary attribute in the middle, a bottomless bankroll, is traceable to Jared Kushner, 32, a scion of the family that owns the Puck.        


“It’s a gorgeous, magical building,” Mr. Kushner said, “but I wanted it to become the most incredible that it could be, let it realize its full potential. The truth is that a lot of old buildings, if they’re not properly invested in, become tired old buildings. I wanted to take an icon and not just preserve it, but improve it.”        
He’s been at it for eight years, and in 2011 survived a three-month tussle with the Landmarks Preservation Commission to consolidate his mission: Mr. Kushner saw the Puck’s future, and it was penthouses.        
After ruling out a rooftop boutique hotel or restaurant, he opted to take the luxury condominium route as the most appropriate mode of ratcheting up the Puck’s relevance to the 21st-century downtown real estate market. He is now crowning the already regal building with six loft-style residences to be called the Puck Penthouses. Five will replace what had been disused office space on the eighth and ninth floors, with a sixth to be built on the roof.        
They have their own private entrance behind a “Puck-blue door” at 295 Lafayette Street, an elegant lobby with a cast-iron fireplace imported from Europe and an amusing stained-glass caricature of Puck by the elevator. Mr. Kushner came up with that novel but expensive décor enhancer while touring churches in Prague with his wife, Ivanka Trump. He has a hard time not thinking about work.        
Each home is configured differently, one is finished, and all are intended as artisanal masterworks, right down to their limited-edition La Cornue stoves from France, bullet-shaped H. Theophile door hinges, and custom Kolbe mahogany-framed windows with built-in UV-protection for art and furniture. (Mr. Kushner ripped out the windows he originally commissioned after deciding they weren’t picture perfect.) Cherished holdovers from yesteryear include fluted iron columns, ash insulation and brick barrel-vault ceilings, circa 1885.        
“I realized very early on that while it’s still relatively early in my overall career, there is a really good chance that I would never again have an opportunity to work on a project this unique,” said Mr. Kushner, who spends at least three days a week on the construction site and isn’t shy about scolding anyone who forgets to put dust-slippers over his or her shoes before entering pristine No. PH VI (Roman numerals being so much more imperial than regular old numbers).        
There, a site supervisor he nicknamed Mariano Rivera is in charge of putting the finishing touches on a 4,895-square-foot, three-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath residence priced at $21 million. Its opulent 1,600-square-foot master suite overlooks another downtown landmark, the Basilica of St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral and picturesque cemetery. “It’s always nice to know you’ll have quiet neighbors,” Mr. Kushner said.        
The penthouses, of which only PH VI is market-ready, range from $21 million to $60 million; two will be duplexes, three will have outdoor space, and three overlook a roof garden.        
Whether Mr. Kushner’s taste and vision turns out to be tailor-made for the luxury downtown marketplace has yet to be determined, but Pamela Liebman, the president of the Corcoran Group, was impressed after a recent tour.        
“This is what everybody thinks a loft in SoHo should look like, but can never find,” she said, adding, “There’s so much money out there now chasing large apartments. I think anyone who lives there is going to feel important.”

They don’t make them like this anymore: genteel, old-fashioned restaurants with beautiful tiles and intricate, carefully maintained murals framed by rich dark wood; with enough space among tables that conversations can remain private; where music doesn’t boom and blare; where service is calm and patrons unrushed. Aquario is such a place. That may explain why, even though the kitchen has its ups and downs, the restaurant has enjoyed two decades across the road from Silver Lake in West Harrison.        


One recent weekend evening, two of the party rooms were taken and the main dining room, called the Tagus River Room, filled up quickly. The murals depict such a sunny, idyllic life on the river and among the grapevines that we wondered about booking a seat on the next flight to Lisbon.        
Today’s diets have caught up with what Aquario has been serving since its inception: seafood and a luscious variety of seasonal vegetables. But before the main course, nibble on a few black olives or slices of linguiça, a salty Portuguese sausage, tasty treats that might go with, say, a lime-loaded caipirinha, a fruity sangria or a husky Portuguese red.        
A simple arugula and radicchio salad with forgettable French and astringent avocado dressings on the side, and the caldo verde, an overly salted soup with grainy potato, could easily be given the go-by. Better starters were to come, like cool, sweet honeydew overlaid with prosciutto; and two small, smooth squid stuffed with a mince of vegetables and shrimp and bathed in a shallow pool of sheer tomato sauce. Good bread made handy sops for this and other sauces, like the sweet garlic that came with tender broiled octopus.        
The snails in Cognac sauce are said to be a favorite first course here and we can understand why, even if they are an odd entry on the menu at Aquario, which describes itself as a Portuguese and Brazilian restaurant. Served over perfectly cooked linguine, they made an ultrarich and delectable dish. The generous dose of Cognac in the pale tomato cream sauce delivered a heady aroma and taste. The decent green New Zealand mussels lacked balance, however, flooded by a nonetheless tasty spread of thick, semi-molten cuts of tomato, onion and colorful sweet peppers.        
Entrees had their highs and lows as well. Portuguese stews are a personal favorite, but here it might be better to stick with those that exclude pork, like mariscada or the fisherman’s rice stew with shellfish. One stew, done in the style of the Alentejo region of Portugal, included cubes of dry, lean pork, which detracted from the goodness of the clams and cilantro-rich wine sauce carrying this dish. They did the same for an otherwise winning paelha, which was heaped with good seafood, chicken and saffron rice.        
Less intricate fish preparations were more successful. Served with a brown butter sauce on the side, whole Dover sole was sautéed perfectly, as was a thick cut of moist swordfish covered with soft, luscious balsamic onions. Firm and meaty monkfish received the restaurant’s signature medley of fresh tomato, onion and sweet peppers. But still too tough and salty, the bacalao — salt cod — could have used another day of rinsing and soaking.        
A panoply of vegetables accompanied the fish entrees. Expect an appropriate variety from a seasonal stock that in early September included cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, string beans, tomatoes and, not least, onions and sweet green and red peppers. A dish of rice and black beans was also served.        
In the wake of such hearty food, desserts were hard to contemplate. Yet, when a dessert tray of almost a dozen selections was presented, we relented. Most of the cakes and tarts were unremarkable, but we enjoyed mini custard tarts (pastéis de nata); a huge baked apple; not-too-sweet, eggy flan; and especially a choice of seasonal fruits, including ripe figs and that sweet honeydew from the appetizer list.

GOOD 
THE SPACE An untidy passage leads from the entrance bar to a clutch of four dining rooms, two of them with a partial view of Silver Lake. Lovely tiles and colorful murals of Portugal cover the walls, and an expanse of windows and draperies further brightens the main dining room. Wheelchair accessible.        
THE CROWD Multigenerational. Small groups cluster around roomy round tables in the main dining room; larger parties take over the more private rooms. No welcome at the door and the owner can seem aloof, but the wait staff is informative, friendly and attentive. Nonetheless, plan on a leisurely meal.        
THE BAR Full bar and lounge open throughout the day. Portuguese wines lead an international list with very low markups. Wines by the bottle range from $17 to $130; cocktails and wine by the glass, $8.        
THE BILL Lunch entrees, $14.50 to $19.50. Dinner entrees, $17 to $35; steak with lobster, $43. Major credit cards accepted.        
WHAT WE LIKED Melon with prosciutto, snails with Cognac sauce over linguine, stuffed baby squid, octopus broiled with garlic and oil, swordfish, monkfish, Dover sole, seafood stews, pastéis de nata (mini custard tarts), flan, fresh seasonal fruit.        
IF YOU GO Lunch, Monday to Saturday, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Dinner, Monday to Saturday, 3 to 10 p.m.; Sunday, 1 to 10 p.m. Parking on the street or in an adjoining lot. Reservations are a good idea, especially on weekends.        
RATINGS Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.  
★ ‘The Act of Killing’ (No rating, 1:55) In Joshua Oppenheimer’s intensely disturbing documentary, veterans of Indonesian death squads active during the anti-Communist slaughter of the mid-’60s, re-enact their crimes with costumes, makeup and a shocking lack of remorse. (A.O. Scott)        
‘Adore’ (R, 1:50) Sexy doings on the Australian coast, as parallel love affairs blossom between two friends (Naomi Watts and Robin Wright) and their almost-grown sons (Xavier Samuel and James Frecheville). The French actress and director Anne Fontaine’s first English-language film, based on a novella by Doris Lessing, is awkwardly perched at the intersection between earnest romanticism, farce and late-night cable-television soft-core pornography. (Scott)        
‘Ain’t Them Bodies Saints’ (No rating, 1:45) A Texas outlaw (Casey Affleck), the mother of his child (Rooney Mara) and a kindly sheriff’s deputy (Ben Foster) are the main players in David Lowery’s meticulous, atmospheric western noir, which subordinates the nasty, pulpy implications of the material in a hushed, solemn and unconvincing atmosphere. (Scott)        
‘Austenland’ (PG-13, 1:30) Opting for crass over clever and slapstick over satire, this juvenile comedy from Jerusha Hess follows a mousy Jane Austen obsessive (Keri Russell) to an English theme park without once pausing to wonder why a 21st-century woman would yearn for the unyielding strictures of 19th-century love. (Jeannette Catsoulis)        
‘Blue Caprice’ (R, 1:33) This prelude to the Beltway sniper attacks of 2002, is hauntingly imagined by Alexandre Moors, with Isaiah Washington and Tequan Richmond as the shooters, an angry, unhinged military veteran and his troubled, quiet young protégé. (Scott)        
★ ‘Blue Jasmine’ (PG-13, 1:38) A brilliant, shattering Cate Blanchett plays a wealthy woman brought devastatingly low — think of Ruth Madoff by way of Blanche DuBois — in Woody Allen’s most sustained and satisfying film since “Match Point.” The excellent, characteristically Allen-eclectic cast includes Alec Baldwin, Sally Hawkins, Louis C.K., Bobby Cannavale, Andrew Dice Clay, Peter Sarsgaard and Michael Stuhlbarg. (Manohla Dargis)        
‘Closed Circuit’ (R, 1:36) This slick, tasty slice of nonsense from Britain, directed by John Crowley from a script by Steve Knight, comes soaked in gunmetal blue and paranoia. Eric Bana and Rebecca Hall play former lovers and London-area lawyers who have been charged with defending an accused terrorist amid reams of paperwork, courtroom dates and escalating genre complications. It’s not John le Carré, but it keeps you watching. (Dargis)        
★ ‘The Conjuring’ (R, 1:52) This fantastically effective haunted-house movie directed by James Wan purports to tell a true 1970s story about a family whose pastoral dream became a nightmare soon after they moved into a farmhouse. Think Amityville, but in Rhode Island. The very good cast includes Lili Taylor, Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and Ron Livingston. (Dargis)        
‘Despicable Me 2’ (PG, 1:38) “Despicable Me 2” tries so hard to double your pleasure that it emerges from the test kitchen slightly burned. Like the jams and jellies that its reformed main character, Gru, is making in his new line of work, it combines too many flavors along with extra sugar. Once again, the lesson, rarely learned by blockbuster sequels — that more is not necessarily better — is forgotten. (Stephen Holden)        
‘Disney’s Planes’ (PG, 1:31) This animated tale about a crop duster that competes in a race against much sleeker, more powerful airplanes is in the “Cars” lineage, but it tries to duplicate the success of those movies through imitation more than innovation. Even youngsters might feel as if they’ve seen this story before. (Neil Genzlinger)        
★ ‘Drinking Buddies’ (R, 1:30) In this loose, insightful romantic comedy, Joe Swanberg explores the problem of male-female friendship as it arises between Kate (Olivia Wilde) and Luke (Jake Johnson), co-workers at a Chicago microbrewery. They are attached to other people (Ron Livingston and Anna Kendrick) but clearly in love. Mr. Swanberg gracefully scrambles the rules of the genre and captures the fun and anguish of young people who are not entirely sure of the rules they should live by. (Scott)        
‘Elysium’  (R, 1:49) It’s back to the dystopian future with “Elysium,” a cautionary shocker from the director Neill Blomkamp about a Hobbesian war of all against all from which only Matt Damon can save us. (Dargis)        
★ ‘Enough Said’ (PG-13, 1:31) In Nicole Holofcener’s flawlessly written, moving new comedy, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss plays Eva, a divorced Los Angeles massage therapist who simultaneously starts dating Albert (James Gandolfini) and massaging his ex-wife, Marianne (Catherine Keener). In exploring the farcical implications of this situation, Ms. Holofcener goes deep into the ethical and emotional complications of modern middle-class adulthood. With Toni Collette and Ben Falcone as Eva’s married friends, Tracey Fairaway as her daughter, and Tavi Gevinson as the daughter’s needy friend Chloe. (Scott)

VINALHAVEN, Maine — Visit Robert Indiana’s remote Maine mansion — arch, beautiful and borderline bizarre — and you’ll find a man, and an artist, surrounded, and haunted, by LOVE.        


The word, that is: images of Mr. Indiana’s 1966 signature work, “LOVE,” its four letters colored and cubed, hang on his walls, sit on his shelves and peek through his windows. It’s emblazoned on posters, depicted in paintings, hewed in marble and sewn in sequins. It’s in English, and in Spanish and Hebrew and Chinese. And it is cast on coffee mugs, splashed across magazine covers and on the sides of a pair of high-top Converses.        
“Have you seen one of my contributions to American culture?” Mr. Indiana said. “So that all of our athletes can be properly shod?”        
If you detect a touch of ambivalence — antipathy, even — toward the word from the man who created it, you are not mistaken. Indeed, while “LOVE” made Mr. Indiana famous around the world, success came at a steep price, some say: namely, a lack of critical reckoning given many of his Pop Art peers like Warhol, Oldenburg and Lichtenstein. He is, in some ways, both neglected — and overexposed.        
“I am a father to a bad child,” Mr. Indiana said. “It bit me.”        
In particular, Mr. Indiana said, because “LOVE” — with its tilted O — wasn’t properly copyrighted, it spread to all sorts of places and products he didn’t want. And that broke his heart. “Rip-offs have done a great harm to my own reputation,” he said.        
But this week, restoring that critical appreciation will be the goal of a new exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, billed as the first major American museum retrospective of Mr. Indiana’s work.        
“It’s long overdue,” the artist said during a recent visit to his home, on an island in Penobscot Bay, a Pollock-like splatter of land about 15 miles off Rockland. “I was famous in the ’60s. I’m having this retrospective in 2013. Well, that’s taken quite a while.”        
It’s a show that its curator, Barbara Haskell, named “Robert Indiana: Beyond LOVE” both to credit Mr. Indiana as the creator of one of Pop Art’s best-known pieces and to move him past it.        
“For his career, it’s really been problematic, because of the sheer ubiquity of it,” she said. “And I think it’s blinded people to the depth of his work.”        
Ms. Haskell said she hoped to show that while “his work has this dazzling, bold, hard-edged surface, the subtext is all conceptually very complicated.”        
John Wilmerding, an emeritus professor of American art at Princeton, said that Mr. Indiana, like other Pop artists, drew from contemporary consumer culture as well as printing and advertising. But, he added, Mr. Indiana was more of an outlier, marked by his fondness for literary touches and abstraction. “Many historians would argue he’s on the margins on Pop,” he said. “And I would place him there too.”        
Ms. Haskell has included lesser-known works, many of which include the symbols common to Mr. Indiana’s prodigious, and more famous, output. There are numerals and circles, stars and “herms” — the narrow sculptures, affixed with wheels, which resemble Roman mile markers. And, of course, there are words: short, simple messages like “EAT” and “DIE” (more on this later), “MEN” and “SEX.” For better or worse, though, no single word has meant more to Mr. Indiana’s career than “LOVE,” which began as an image on a Christmas card and ended up as a series of large sculptures seen everywhere from Taipei to Wichita.        
“I’m sure all the people who have been born 20 years ago don’t know anything about me at all, except ‘LOVE,’ ” said Mr. Indiana, adding with a mischievous glint, “And that’s a nasty word.”        
Getting older can make people blunt, and Mr. Indiana, 85 and in faltering health, is blunt. Ask about Pop Art, for instance, and he says he was a reluctant member of the movement. “I didn’t like being identified in that way,” he said. The very name was “a trifle.”        
“How can you take something like P-O-P seriously?” he asked.        
Similarly, inquire about the current state of American art and you get this: “Too many artists, too many galleries and too many people interested in art.”        
“And those too many people are not very interesting,” he added.

Afrojack (Sunday) A sure sign of mainstream infiltration: when your romances make the tabloids. That pretty much became true when Afrojack, a Grammy-winning Dutch D.J.-producer, dated Paris Hilton, leading dance-music naysayers to chirp that the trendy scene had lost its cool cachet. The single, “Take Over Control,” and an expansive national tour persevered. At 7 p.m., MCU Park, 1904 Surf Avenue, at West 17th Street, Coney Island, Brooklyn, rpmpresents.com; $50 and $75. (Stacey Anderson)        
★ Neko Case (Thursday) In another era, Ms. Case’s smoky country-pop pipes and graceful songscribing would have made her a mainstream star twice over, with a variety show on ABC that co-starred Johnny Cash for good measure. With its steely backbone and tight refrains, her newly released studio album, “The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You” (Anti-), nods to her earliest days spent delivering twangy cover songs; Ms. Case’s vaguely gonzo wailing about ’80s nostalgia, feminist mores and bled-dry heartache remain her own distinct tornado. With AC Newman. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (866) 858-0008, radiocity.com; $35 and $45. (Anderson)        
City and Colour (Friday) The lithe pop singer Dallas Green offers a featherweight falsetto and the palpable humility of an artist with his feet firmly planted. This solo project of Mr. Green’s, long a cult favorite in his native Ontario, yielded a hearty, enriching release in 2012, “Little Hell” (Vagrant). With Lissie and Lucy Rose. At 6 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, midpark at 70th Street, ticketmaster.com; $35. (Anderson)        
Ian Hunter (Friday and Saturday) The former lead singer of Mott the Hoople has strummed that group’s 1972 hit, “All the Young Dudes” (a gift from David Bowie), in scores of New York spaces. Yet whether he’s warbling in the former John Varvatos boutique in SoHo or beside City Winery’s towering casks, he always sounds genuinely moved by the buoyant chorus. At 8 p.m., City Winery, 155 Varick Street, near Spring Street, South Village, (212) 608-0555, citywinery.com; sold out. (Anderson)        
★ Icona Pop (Friday and Wednesday) As their 2012 single “I Love It” shows no signs of fading from Williamsburg watering hole playlists, the Swedish singer-D.J.s behind the ecstatic electro-pop hit will release their first international album, “This Is ... Icona Pop” (Record Company TEN/Big Beat), on Tuesday. At Governors Ball, the pair proved their mettle with unexpectedly thick dubstep hooks, especially on the defiant and delightful “Manners.” With K. Flay and Sirah. Friday at 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (800) 745-3000, websterhall.com/events; sold out. Wednesday at 8:30 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; sold out. (Anderson)        
Tom Odell (Saturday) This British singer-songwriter purred through a torchy cover of “New York State of Mind” at the Bowery Ballroom in the spring. It was no surprise given his unwavering enthusiasm for bleeding-heart pop balladry on his debut studio album, “Long Way Down” (RCA). He won the critics’ choice trophy at the Brit Awards for that reckless romanticism, though he could stand to add a tougher, more contemporary counterpoint to his sound. With Vance Joy. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, irvingplaza.com; $16. (Anderson)        
Oh Land (Friday) This Danish singer-songwriter, whose real name is Nanna Oland Fabricius, employs her jazzy waver wisely; it makes even her harshest dismissals, like the wryly near-expletive “Sun of a Gun,” hitch with vulnerability. Her second electro-pop album, “Oh Land” (Epic), shares the smart club-ready charisma of Robyn and Lykke Li with added R&B flourishes. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $20. (Anderson)        
Okkervil River (Thursday) These erudite indie-rockers from Austin, Tex., are known for vast conceptual albums, be the topics a heroin-addicted folk singer (“Black Sheep Boy”) or the plight of a failing glam-rock band (“The Stand Ins”). “I Am Very Far” (Jagjaguwar), released in 2011, was more bombastic and straightforward; their latest, “The Silver Gymnasium” (ATO), released last month, aims to be more accessible as it revisits the pleasures and uncertainties of childhood. With Black Joe Lewis & the Honey Bears and Pickwick. At 7 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (800) 745-3000, terminal5nyc.com; $27.50 in advance; $30 at the door. (Anderson)

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 26, 2013Three pop music entries in the Listings pages on Friday included errors.
The entry about the band Okkervil River, which is performing at Terminal 5 in Manhattan tonight, misidentified its latest album. It is “The Silver Gymnasium,” released this month by ATO — not “I Am Very Far,” which was released by Jagjaguwar in 2011.
The entry about the singer-songwriter Tom Odell, who performed at Irving Plaza on Saturday, referred incompletely to his debut album, “Long Way Down.” While it was released in Britain and other countries by Columbia in June, it was released in the United States on Sept. 17 by RCA, not by Columbia.
And the entry about Lionel Richie, who performed Tuesday night at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, misstated the highest ranking his album “Tuskegee” reached on the Billboard charts. It reached No. 1 on the album and country album charts; it did not peak at No. 2.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 26, 2013An earlier version of the correction about the entry about Tom Odell misidentified the site where he performed on Saturday. It was Irving Plaza, not the Bowery Ballroom, where he played in the spring.

“In the Air,” T. J. Wilcox’s dazzling panoramic film installation at the Whitney Museum, is an ode to New York and to film, and to their mutually enhancing entwining. Mr. Wilcox is equally enamored of both. His new work makes you realize anew that the metropolis and the moving image were made for each other.        


This piece centers on an in-the-round bird’s-eye view of Lower Manhattan that was shot from the artist’s studio, the 18th-floor penthouse of a building on Union Square, and compresses the passing of one day into 30 minutes. Like the old-style panorama, it appears on a circular screen, one that is about 7 feet high and 35 feet in diameter. Hanging about four and a half feet above the floor, it’s like a giant lampshade.        
“In the Air” is something of a departure for Mr. Wilcox, 47, who has always come across as a kind of Romantic miniaturist. He is best known for films only a few minutes long (and often looped) that are pieced together from all kinds of existing footage. Sometimes he would reshoot the found film several times to achieve grainy, fog-of-memory textures; still images and brief, tabletop sequences that he shot himself were other staples. These works were intimate, handmade reveries, cryptic yet resonant with outsize themes: history, death, love, fame. Mixing fact and fiction, they conjured historic figures like Marlene Dietrich or Alexander the Great, but could also be autobiographical.        
While Mr. Wilcox’s early efforts were most memorable when projected small, with “In the Air” he goes big, and it works. He seems to have done this almost reflexively, spurred by the astounding 360-degree view from his studio, to which he moved from a lower floor in the same building two years ago.        
Paralysis was his first response to this spectacular sight. He has said more than once that he initially spent so much time looking at the view that he thought he might stop making art altogether. But, in the end, he used the beautiful, implacable city as the setting and also the motivating force for a half-dozen miniaturist narratives, expanding his collage aesthetic without sacrificing its intimacy.        
After considerable trial and error and some uncooperative weather, Mr. Wilcox was finally able, in July, to shoot about 15 hours’ worth of one day in the life of New York City. It took several weeks for conditions to align. Consistent with his preference for lower-tech gear, he downgraded his equipment from five complicated cameras to the same number of relatively small, rugged, inexpensive GoPros. He also switched from filming to shooting stills, which improved resolution. And he prayed for sun, attended by skies that were not completely cloudless and boring.        
He ended up with 60,000 stills, shot at a rate of one per second. These were individually processed, and then animated and sped up using a computer program that seamlessly stitched the views together, eliminated distortions and evened light levels.        
The majesty and clarity of this wraparound vista is stunning. The city looks older, almost timeless, without the details of street traffic and storefronts. The sights include the Con Edison clock tower, Zeckendorf Towers, Freedom Tower and the West Side, with glimpses of the Hudson and New Jersey. The sun appears and sets; clouds of many different shades and shapes push their shadows across the masses of architecture; airplanes arrive and depart; the lights of the city come on and then dim, as the sun returns.        
This flat-footed documentary approach evokes Andy Warhol’s deadpan, all-but-motionless 1964 classic, “Empire” — that eight-hour stationary shot of the Empire State Building — but Mr. Wilcox is too much of a storyteller to leave it at this. Superimposed on the panorama are six short cameo-films — in a way, details — that pull us from one place or era, one event or personality to another, across varying film methods, between color and black and white. The cameos appear one at a time on different parts of the screen, each with its own title, forming a carefully linked loop of narratives.        
Some draw on Mr. Wilcox’s life. “On the Horizon” remembers the prominent fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez, stringing together images of his work and film footage and stills of him and also of break dancers performing in his studio. A book of Mr. Lopez’s drawings and Polaroids that Mr. Wilcox saw as a teenager ignited his desire to be in New York, but by the time he arrived, the scene that attracted him was being ravaged by AIDS, which took Mr. Lopez’s life in 1987, at the age of 44. Looking through this volume recently, Mr. Wilcox recognized the Con Edison tower in the backgrounds of some images of the break dancers: Mr. Lopez’s former studio was across the square, within sight of his.

★ Ralph Alessi Baida Quartet (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Alessi has been a calm, exacting and, sometimes, fascinating presence on New York bandstands over the last two decades. He’s a good collaborator with leaders like Ravi Coltrane, Steve Coleman and Fred Hersch; in his own groups, he balances elegant precision and power. “Baida” (ECM) is his new album with a quartet including the pianist Jason Moran, the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer Nasheet Waits, who all return here.

Opera 
★ ‘Anna Nicole’ (Saturday, Tuesday, Wednesday, next Friday and Sept. 28) In an ambitious co-production with the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Next Wave Festival, the New York City Opera is opening its season with this exhilarating staging of the British composer Mark-Anthony Turnage’s audacious, entertaining and, in its strange way, wrenching recent opera. Yes, that Anna Nicole. Commissioned by the Royal Opera in London, this work was a major success at its 2011 premiere and that brash, colorful and choreographic staging, directed by Richard Jones, has been deftly adapted here. The clever libretto by Richard Thomas, full of raunchy dialogue, is funny, yet true to the tawdry and tragic elements of the real Ms. Smith’s life. But it is Mr. Turnage’s score, which blends pungent modernist music with jazz and clattering cabaret, that gives this work its poignancy and turns Anna (portrayed by the soprano Sarah Joy Miller, who is vivacious and fearless) into an improbable operatic heroine. It should not be missed. This production, however, comes as City Opera is facing a potentially crippling financial crisis. At 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $68 to $235 remaining. (Anthony Tommasini)        
★ ‘Così Fan Tutte’ (Tuesday) James Levine, still nominally the Met Opera’s music director, returns to its podium for the first time since May 2011, after which he was sidelined with injuries and illness. He makes his comeback in a Mozart classic that he has led at the Met dozens of times, featuring a young, capable cast of Susanna Phillips, Isabel Leonard, Danielle de Niese, Matthew Polenzani and Rodion Pogossov. The Met’s production, light-filled and polite (originally directed by Lesley Koenig), is no great shakes, but everyone will be on his or her best behavior for this one. (Through Oct. 5.) At 7:30 p.m., (212) 362-6000, metoperafamily.org; $27 to $445. (Zachary Woolfe)        
★ ‘Eugene Onegin’ (Monday and Thursday) The Russian diva Anna Netrebko continues her run of opening nights at the Metropolitan Opera into a third season with a role she was born to sing, Tatiana in this lushly Romantic Tchaikovsky classic. The distinguished actress Fiona Shaw recently stepped in for her longtime collaborator, Deborah Warner, who was sidelined by unexpected surgery, as the director of a starry cast that also includes Mariusz Kwiecien in the title role and Piotr Beczala as Lenski. Valery Gergiev will conduct. Some opera fans have urged the Met to dedicate its gala performance to the support of gay rights to protest new restrictions in Russia on the discussion of homosexuality. Ms. Netrebko and Mr. Gergiev supported the 2012 campaign of President Vladimir V. Putin. Whether the Met likes it or not, art and politics is converging here. (Through Dec. 12.) Monday at 6:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., (212) 362-6000, metoperafamily.org; $140 to $1,750 on Monday, $124 to $495 on Thursday. (Woolfe)        
‘No Hotel’ (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) The multidisciplinary group Object Collection presents “No Hotel,” an innovative 70-minute opera about films, bad behavior and hotels that was influenced by Warhol’s “Chelsea Girls.” In his review for The New York Times this month, Steve Smith wrote, “Most of the dialogue is spoken, with sporadic singing and bursts of what might be termed shriekstemme; the music, despite its seeming randomness, hews uncannily to rising and falling tides of eventfulness.” At 8 p.m., Incubator Art’s Project, St. Mark’s Church in the Bowery, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, incubatorarts.org; $18, $14 for students. (Vivien Schweitzer)        
Classical Music 
American Classical Orchestra (Monday) The American Classical Orchestra, the lively period-instrument ensemble that has specialized in overlooked works from the 17th- through early-19th century, presents a program of Italian works, titled “Fiori Musicali,” ending with a sort of Italian symphony, conducted by the orchestra’s founder Thomas C. Crawford. The flutists Sandra Miller and Anne Briggs will be heard in Cimarosa’s Concerto for Two Flutes and Orchestra. There are works by Boccherini, Rossini and an early-20th-century score by Respighi. The program ends with Mozart’s Symphony No. 13 in F, written by the composer when he was 15 and in Milan absorbing everything Italian. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, amerclassorch.org; $35 to $90. (Tommasini)        
Bargemusic (Friday through Sunday) The young composer Mohammed Fairouz may be best known for a precocious work written in 2008 when he was just 22, “Sumeida’s Song,” an intense 60-minute one-act opera that effectively combines Middle Eastern and Western musical elements. He has been prolific since then, too prolific, some critics say. An audience will have an opportunity for an immersion in Mr. Fairouz’s music on Friday when Bargemusic, as part of its Here and Now series, presents an all-Fairouz program featuring the Catalyst String Quartet, the pianist Lara Downes and other performing artists. On Saturday night and Sunday afternoon the pianist Gerald Robbins, the Braude Ensemble and members of Jeunes Virtuoses de New York perform a program of chamber concertos: Bach’s Concerto No. 5 for Keyboard and Orchestra in F minor, Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 11 and Mendelssohn’s Concerto for Violin, Piano and String in D minor. Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (800) 838-3006, bargemusic.org; $35 and $45; $30 and $40 for 65+; $15 and $25 for students.

In “Kevin and Me,” a video by the black performance artist Dave McKenzie, the camera focuses downward on the artist’s legs and feet as he walks along a wood-planked pedestrian bridge. One of his legs is twisted, causing him to limp. As he advances he begins to walk more naturally until he’s moving normally, at which point he stops to doff his sneakers and puts on a pair of tap shoes awaiting him at a steel joint in the walkway. He then executes a series of precise dance steps along the narrow metal band.        


Movie buffs will recognize this as a clever riff on the end of “The Usual Suspects,” in which Verbal Kint, played by Kevin Spacey, morphs from the loquacious simpleton he’s been pretending to be into the criminal mastermind he really is. Seeing the video in “Radical Presence: Black Performance in Contemporary Art,” an entertaining and philosophically stimulating exhibition at New York University’s Grey Art Gallery, viewers may also read it as an allegory about being black in today’s America. Too often our still white-dominated, mass entertainment media portrays black men as belonging to one of two groups: a large one of bums, defectives and criminals and a tiny one of magically gifted athletes, musicians and comedians, leaving a broad sector of more or less ordinary black citizens underrepresented.        
A remarkable thing about the exhibition is that much of it is in a comical vein, like Mr. McKenzie’s work. The show was organized by Valerie Cassel Oliver, senior curator at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston where it opened last November.        
One of the earliest pieces is David Hammons’s “Bliz-aard Ball Sale,” documented here in a slide show. For that 1983 work, Mr. Hammons stood outdoors on a New York sidewalk selling snowballs neatly arrayed on a blanket at his feet. From more recent times, there’s a series of videos by Jayson Musson, who has made a name for himself as the YouTube personality Hennessy Youngman. Wearing his own version of hip-hop style (bling with a Spider-Man cap, for example), and using street slang, he delivers hilarious, acutely informed lectures on topics like “The Female Gaze” and “Relational Aesthetics.”        
In 2003 Jean-Ulrick Désert enacted “Negerhosen2000/The Travel Albums,” in which he traveled around Germany wearing pink lederhosen. His wanderings are documented in the exhibition through a series of souvenir photomontages featuring snapshots of him posing with people he encountered. In one he’s with a group of white-haired tourists. A handwritten note recalls, “They enjoyed the lightness of ‘Negerhosen/2000’ and marveled at the gravity of its implications.”        
More than two dozen artists are represented in this show, and not all of their works take a humorous approach. For example, in “Pretending to Be Rock” (1993), Sherman Fleming stayed on hands and knees under dripping candles until he could no longer bear the wax accumulating on his naked back.        
But since a strain of purposeful absurdity — as opposed to, say, didactic righteousness — can be found in almost every piece in the show, Mr. Désert’s observation could apply to the exhibition as a whole. That’s not just incidental. Comedy often turns on contradictions between appearance and reality. Mistaken identities abound in Shakespeare’s comedies and in modern movies like “Trading Places,” in which Eddie Murphy is transformed from a street-level con man into a wealthy investor whose polished demeanor fools the financial elite.        
Many of the exhibition’s works involve deceptive appearances. In 1973 Adrian Piper did a series of outdoor, guerrilla performances as the “Mythic Being,” a menacing man with a mustache and an Afro wig. In the early ‘80s Lorraine O’Grady went to New York art openings as Mlle Bourgeoise Noire wearing a tiara and a floor-length gown made of stitched-together white gloves. In a soap-operatic video called “Conversations Wit De Churen II: All My Churen,” Kalup Linzy appears in several guises, female as well as male, talking in various dialects. For “Eating The Wall Street Journal,” William Pope.L, who bills himself as “the friendliest black artist in America,” appeared as a combination madman and shaman. Wearing only a jockstrap and boots, he sat on a toilet at the top of a 10-foot-high tower and consumed The Journal in strips with the help of ketchup and milk.        
Among the reasons for this penchant for role playing in black performance, you might cite W. E. B. Du Bois’s notion of “double consciousness”: the experience of seeing yourself “through the eyes of others” rather than as you know yourself to be. To exaggerate the disparity between outer and inner, comically or otherwise, can be a way to unsettle prejudicial ideas about identity. But there’s more to it than that. Between appearance and reality imaginative fields may open for the emergence of new realities and other ways of being not only black or white but human. If the sci-fi-psychedelic, digitally animated videos by the young artist and dancer Jacolby Satterwhite (born 1986) presage the future of black performance, it’s one that’s pregnant with mind-stretching possibility.        
For immediate purposes, there’s another half of the exhibition still to come. Part II will open at the Studio Museum in Harlem on Nov. 14. Many live performances are scheduled for the run of both shows, including a series coordinated with this year’s biennial performance extravaganza Performa 13, Nov. 1 to 24. Avant-garde performance by black artists has never received this much attention, so mark your calendar.        



 
“Radical Presence: Black Performance in Contemporary Art” runs through Dec. 7 at Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village; (212)998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart.

Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance. A searchable guide to these and other performances is at nytimes.com/events. 


Maria Elena Anaya (Fridays and Saturdays, through Sept. 28) Ms. Anaya, a flamenco artist based in Mexico, travels north with “Eclipsis Flamenco: Encounter of Two Worlds,” a collaboration with the director Nora Jacobs. The titular encounter refers to the blending of Spanish and pre-Columbian cultures at the root of modern Mexican life, evoked through dance, live music and poetry by Ms. Anaya and her performers. The close quarters of Dixon Place should only heighten the impact of the stories they have to tell. At 7:30 p.m., Dixon Place, 161A Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736, dixonplace.org; $16 in advance, $20 at the door, $12 for students and 65+. (Siobhan Burke)        
AUNTS (Tuesday) Laurie Berg and Liliana Dirks-Goodman, otherwise known as AUNTS, host Performance Space 122’s season launch party at Issue Project Room. Like the dance events that AUNTS frequently stage in unlikely spots, the party will include overlapping performances, interdisciplinary work, too many artists to name; as press materials state, “their signature fashion of overstimulation.” Which sounds like a lot of fun. At 7 p.m., Issue Project Room, 22 Boerum Place, at Livingston Street, Downtown Brooklyn, (866) 811-4111, ps122.org; $30 in advance, $35 at the door, which includes an open bar and snacks. (Roslyn Sulcas)        
★ BEAT Festival (Friday and Saturday) The acronym stands for Brooklyn Emerging Artists in Theater, with “theater” broadly defined. It may sound generic, but this largely site-specific festival, founded last year by Stephen Shelley, is anything but, integrating performance into public spaces that could use more creative life. The choreographer Yanira Castro erects a new installation, “Nancy,” at Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration on Friday, and on Saturday LeeSaar The Company hosts an open rehearsal at Congregation Beth Elohim. Various times and locations, (347) 762-3281, beatbrooklyn.com; up to $20; but many events are free. (Burke)        
★ Boyzie Cekwana and Panaibra Canda (Wednesday and Thursday) One of the most important choreographers to have emerged from post-apartheid South Africa, Boyzie Cekwana, teams up with the Mozambican choreographer Panaibra Canda in “The Inkomati (dis)cord,” a work inspired by a failed 1984 agreement between their respective countries, and drawing on their personal histories and experiences. There will be a pre-performance talk on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m., and a post-performance talk on Thursday. At 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $20. (Sulcas)        
Da-On Dance (Thursday through Sept. 28) A new evening-length work, “Thirst,” by the Korean choreographer Jin Ju Song-Begin is based on themes from Dante’s “Inferno.” (“Such as desire, greed, punishment, incessant chase, loss of self, suffering, and the nature of hell,” the Danspace Web site helpfully tells us.) The work is set to an original score by Jerome Begin, and features the musician Loren Dempster. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark’s Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $20, $15 for members, $10 for 12 and younger. (Sulcas)        
Fanny de Chaillé and Philippe Ramette (Thursday through Sept. 28) The choreographer Fanny de Chaillé and the visual artist Philippe Ramette collaborate on “Acting Out,” 12 performances that show the artists as human sculptures set in motion. The work, presented as an installation through which the audience can wander, is part of the marvelous French Institute Alliance Française’s Crossing the Line festival, which also presents Ms. de Chaillé in “The Library” (Tuesday and Thursday), during which visitors choose from a catalog of titles and watch the performers bring them to life. “Acting Out”: Thursday through Sept. 28 at 8 p.m., Invisible Dog Art Center, 51 Bergen Street, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, fiaf.org; $30, $20 for members. “The Library”: Tuesday and Thursday at 4 p.m., French Institute Alliance Française, Haskell Library, 22 East 60th Street, Manhattan, (800) 982-2787, fiaf.org; free.

Smack in the middle of the Metropolitan Museum, there’s a nugget of compressed light called “Medieval Treasures From Hildesheim.” Visually, the show is eminently graspable: a one-room cluster of 50 objects, many jewel-encrusted or covered in gold. In other ways, the art is almost beyond reach, being about the power politics of spirituality in a distant age, a subject that today’s drive-by museumgoer would seem to know little, or care little, about.        


A millennium ago, Hildesheim, in northern Germany, was one of the ecclesiastical centers of Western Europe. Under the patronage of Ottonian emperors, who ruled from A.D. 919 to 1014, it was a city of churches, the outstanding one being its grand cathedral, packed with art advertising the glory of God and kings. And because, for both, only the best would do, Hildesheim developed a top-class art industry. Its metal-casting workshops were superbly innovative; illuminated books poured from its scriptoria.        
Today, its churches and museums still preserve one of the richest and densest concentrations of 11th-century European religious art anywhere. And the Met show is pure cream skimmed off the top.        
That the art in it has survived at all is some kind of miracle. Many of these objects were made as much for active use as for contemplation. Large-scale sculptures were on constant public display in churches, being touched and kissed. Smaller ones traveled the streets in processions. Gospel books were thumbed-through during services; liturgical vessels were moved about: carried, cleaned, dropped, repaired.        
And, of course, history kept happening. Power changed hands, and, with it, control over churches and treasures. In the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation put Roman Catholic art under threat. Enforced secularization in the 19th century also took a toll. Toward the end of World War II, old Hildesheim was leveled by bombs. A renovation of the rebuilt cathedral has supplied the pretext for sending its art to the Met.        
Although almost none of the work can be attributed to individual artists, the name of one man hovers in the air, that of Bernward, bishop of Hildesheim from A.D. 993 to 1022. Of noble Saxon lineage, he was more than a high-ranking cleric. He was a cosmopolitan traveler, a court fixture, a cultural impresario, a serial self-promoter and, eventually, a canonized saint. He was also one of the great shaping art patrons of his day, and possibly an artist himself.        
His major architectural project in Hildesheim was the Benedictine church of St. Michael, for which he famously commissioned a set of immense bronze doors, each covered with narrative reliefs. The doors didn’t make it to New York, but at least two sculptures, monumental in feeling and historically associated with Bernward’s name, did.        
One is the so-called Golden Madonna, a statue of the Virgin and Child carved from linden wood overlaid with sheets of hammered gold. Although both its figures are headless now, with their light-glancing surfaces studded with gemstones, they are magnetically opulent and must once have been even more so. Church records report that in the 15th century, the sculpture was half-buried in piles of brooches, rings and necklaces, left as offerings.        
More-is-more was the modus operandi of medieval aesthetics, and the show has textbook examples, beginning with a Gospel owned by Bernward. The book was already nearly a century old when he acquired it, but he freshened it up and made it his own by adding a new cover, with a Byzantine ivory plaque affixed to the front and his own initials splashed across the back. After his death, and maybe to celebrate his election to sainthood, the cover was further adorned with robin’s-egg-size crystals and miniature paintings.        
Material richness aside, the Golden Madonna is significant for being one of the earliest fully three-dimensional sculptures known from medieval Europe. Another is a five-foot-tall figure of the crucified Jesus, believed to have been commissioned by Bernward for the convent of Ringelheim, where his sister was abbess. Displayed high in the gallery, it stands as a kind of benedictory centerpiece for the show. The figure, apart from the arms, which are 12th-century replacements, is cut from a single piece of wood.

National,"










WASHINGTON — House Republicans narrowly pushed through a bill on Thursday that slashes billions of dollars from the food stamp program, over the objections of Democrats and a veto threat from President Obama.        


The vote set up what promised to be a major clash with the Senate and dashed hopes for passage this year of a new five-year farm bill.        
The vote was 217 to 210, largely along party lines.        
Republican leaders, under pressure from Tea Party-backed conservatives, said the bill was needed because the food stamp program, which costs nearly $80 billion a year, had grown out of control. They said the program had expanded even as jobless rates had declined with the easing recession.        
“This bill eliminates loopholes, ensures work requirements, and puts us on a fiscally responsible path,” said Representative Marlin Stutzman, Republican of Indiana, who led efforts to split the food stamps program from the overall farm bill. “In the real world, we measure success by results. It’s time for Washington to measure success by how many families are lifted out of poverty and helped back on their feet, not by how much Washington bureaucrats spend year after year.”        
But even with the cuts, the food stamp program would cost more than $700 billion over the next 10 years.        
Republicans invoked former President Bill Clinton in their defense of the bill, saying that the changes were in the spirit of those that he signed into law in 1996 that set work requirements for those who receive welfare.        
But Democrats, many of whom held up pictures of people they said would lose their benefits, called the cuts draconian and said they would plunge millions into poverty.        
“It’s a sad day in the people’s House when the leadership brings to the floor one of the most heartless bills I have ever seen,” said Representative James McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts. “It’s terrible policy trapped in a terrible process.”        
The measure has little chance of advancing in the Senate, and Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and the chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, called it “a monumental waste of time.”        
The bill, written under the direction of the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, would cut $40 billion from the food stamp program over the next 10 years. It would also require adults between 18 and 50 without minor children to find a job or to enroll in a work-training program in order to receive benefits.        
It would also limit the time those recipients could get benefits to three months. Currently, states can extend food stamp benefits past three months for able-bodied people who are working or preparing for work as part of a job-training program.        
“This bill makes getting Americans back to work a priority again for our nation’s welfare programs,” House Speaker John A. Boehner said.        
The bill would also restrict people enrolled in other social welfare programs from automatically becoming eligible for food stamps.        
In addition, the legislation would allow states to require food stamp recipients to be tested for drugs and to stop lottery winners from getting benefits. The Senate farm bill also contains a restriction on lottery winners.        
Critics of the measure said the cuts would fall disproportionately on children.        
“Yes, the federal government has budget problems, but children didn’t cause them, and cutting anti-hunger investments is the wrong way to solve them,” said Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus Campaign for Children, a child advocacy group.        
According to the Congressional Budget Office, nearly four million people would be removed from the food stamp program under the House bill starting next year. The budget office said after that, about three million a year would be cut off from the program.        
The budget office said that, left unchanged, the number of food stamp recipients would decline by about 14 million people — or 30 percent — over the next 10 years as the economy improves. A Census Bureau report released on Tuesday found that the program had kept about four million people above the poverty level and had prevented millions more from sinking further into poverty. The census data also showed nearly 47 million people living in poverty — close to the highest level in two decades.        
Historically, the food stamp program has been part of the farm bill, a huge piece of legislation that had routinely been passed every five years, authorizing financing for the nation’s farm and nutrition programs. But in July, House leaders split the bill’s farm and nutrition sections into separate measures, passing the farm legislation over Democrats’ objections.        
The move came after the House rejected a proposed farm bill that would have cut $20 billion from the food stamp program. Conservative lawmakers helped kill the bill, saying the program needed deeper cuts.

Museums 
Brooklyn Museum: ‘Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt’ (through December 2014) If your dream of heaven is eternity spent with the pets you love, “Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt” is a show for you. All of its 30 objects, sifted from the museum’s renowned Egyptian collection, are of cats, big and little, feral and tame, celestial and not. Whether cast in bronze or carved in stone, their forms and personalities were meant to outlast time, and so they have. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)        
★ Jewish Museum: ‘Jack Goldstein x 10,000’  (through Sept. 29) The first American museum retrospective of this brilliant but elusive artist, organized by the Orange County Museum of Art, is both a celebration and a cautionary tale. It revels in Goldstein’s posthumous influence as it reveals the tragic disconnect of his life and his art, the desire to disappear complicated by an intense careerist drive. This exhibition offers (in addition to paintings, sculptures and Goldstein’s signature films of the late 1970s) a rare look at the early, performance-based films: works like “Milk,” in which the persistent banging of a fist on a table finally topples a glass, or “Spotlight,” in which a beam chases the artist around an empty room. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)        
The Jewish Museum: ‘Elaine Reichek: A Postcolonial Kinderhood Revisited’  (through Oct. 20) Twenty years ago the Jewish Museum commissioned Elaine Reichek, the artist known for embroidered and knitted social commentary, to create an installation about being Jewish. This exhibition reprises the original installation, which resembles a Colonial-era room in a historic house museum. Closer inspection reveals the story of a mid-20th-century Jewish family so determined to assimilate into American upper-class society as to willingly erase evidence of its own ethnic heritage. It’s an exceptionally elegant, witty yet sad instance of identity politics in art. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)        
Metropolitan Museum of Art: ‘Brush Writing in the Arts of Japan’ (through Jan. 12) This elegant collection-based show is the perfect place to mourn the lost art of handwriting. Here, among the medieval Zen monks, the 11th-century literati and the courtesans of the Edo-era “floating world,” it’s impossible to separate language from gesture and composition from performance. Objects on view are not limited to examples of calligraphy; they include Chinese-influenced ink paintings, decorative objects, large screens and woodblock prints. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)        
★ Metropolitan Museum of Art: ‘Julia Margaret Cameron’ (through Jan. 5) Julia Margaret Cameron took up the camera rather late in her life, at 48, but very early in the life of photography. And as much as anyone of her time, this 19th-century Englishwoman (1815-79) helped the nascent medium grow into a viable art form. The 38 works here, portraits and allegorical groupings from the museum’s collection, highlight the sometimes controversial techniques (moody lighting, shallow depth of field, long exposure times and a soft focus) that gave her pictures exceptional vulnerability, spirituality and candor. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)        
★ Metropolitan Museum of Art: ‘Interwoven Globe: The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800’ (through Jan. 5) The latest Met extravaganza crisscrosses cultures in Europe, the Americas, Asia and India with rare abandon (for the Met), retracing early oceanic trade routes via examples of the fabrics and finished textiles that traveled along them and spread ideas about design, technique and fashion. The resulting feast of transcendent artifacts variously embroidered, woven, dyed and printed is one of the greatest, most multicultural art experiences of the season. Hybridity, a fashionable art-world buzzword, is shown to be as old as the sea. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)        
★ Metropolitan Museum of Art: ‘The Roof Garden Commission: Imran Qureshi’  (through Nov. 3) Visitors to the Met’s rooftop will discover something shocking: the stone terrace is splattered with paint the color of dried blood so that it resembles the scene of some terrible crime. Looking closer at the areas of spillage, viewers will find they have been delicately altered. With deft white and red brush strokes, the Pakistani artist Imran Qureshi has worked into the raw paint a pattern suggestive of leafy shrubbery and flower petals, turning the whole into a politically fraught, allegorical mix symbolizing dualities of life and death and hope and despair.

THE official New York color is gray. The materials are concrete and stone. That is the image.        


In fact, New York is surprisingly green. Nearly 20 percent of the city is public park land, a figure that earned it second place this summer, behind San Diego, when the Trust for Public Land conducted its annual Park Score survey of the 50 largest cities in the United States.        
That’s a lot of park, and the inventory is more varied than many New Yorkers realize. The superstars hog the headlines: Central Park, Madison Square, the botanical gardens in Brooklyn and the Bronx. At sidewalk level, jaded urban eyes scale down their expectations to the window box overflowing with geraniums, the tub of flowers outside a restaurant, the caged-in plantings clinging for dear life to the trunks of trees.        
However, the city teems with unsung small parks and gardens midway on the scale between flower pot and Great Lawn. Some are squeezed in discreet niches between buildings. Others are new and await discovery. Still others have undergone a metamorphosis.        
I have had my eye on a number of these gems, and the waning days of summer — the lull between last bloom and first frost — gave me an excuse to put together an eclectic tour. Several of the choices come from the 52 community gardens that the New York Restoration Project has owned and managed since 1999, most of them known only to neighborhood residents. I zeroed in on the handful that stand out for their landscaping and design. I also included two gardens in the city’s parks system, the Bosque and the Gardens of Remembrance. These sanctuaries, developed between 2001 and 2005, have been hiding in plain sight at the Battery, largely ignored by the throngs heading to the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and Governors Island.        
The Gil Hodges Community Garden in Gowanus, Brooklyn, one of those owned by the Restoration Project, has been around for more than 30 years, but it has just undergone a makeover, with money from the city’s Department of Environmental Protection and from Jo Malone, a British fragrance company. The transformed version opens on Wednesday.        
On a plot of around 3,000 square feet, Yvi McEvilly, the Restoration Project’s director of design, has packed in a maximum of plant activity. Up front, a fragrance garden sends out the aromas of calycanthus, daphne and other species chosen for both nose and eye appeal. A wandering series of steppingstones, recycled shards of concrete from the old garden, leads past raised herb and vegetable beds to a birch reading grove.        
The garden incorporates several environmentally friendly features. A large section of it relies on rainwater collected in an underground reservoir, rather than city water. On two sidewalks, five rectangular tree beds have been enhanced with native plants like ironweed and winterberry. One is now a bioswale: a giant sponge that takes in rainwater diverted from the street and lets it soak into a subterranean chamber, thereby relieving pressure on the sewer system.        
Small can be thrilling. It can also be elusive. The city-owned Lentol Garden in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, a sliver of green pressed right up against the entrance ramp to the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, offers a glimpse of enchantment. Through iron gates, passers-by can feast their eyes on plump hydrangea blooms, purple and ivory butterfly bushes and a magnificent Chinese dogwood, now displaying clusters of raspberrylike fruit.        
Getting inside the gates is another matter, unless you are one of the high school students working on summer programs in environmental science administered by the local Y.M.C.A. and New York University.        
The Restoration Project’s community gardens, on the other hand, must be open to the public 20 hours a week. Sometimes the hours are posted, sometimes not, and the local organizations that operate the gardens day to day do not always keep to the schedule. I never did manage to penetrate Maggie’s Garden, a seductive, beautifully landscaped enclave on 149th Street near Broadway, in Hamilton Heights.        
Even when the gardens keep to their hours, it can feel like a stroke of luck when the gates are open. On a recent weekend, Greg Dava, a Brooklyn resident taking a shortcut to the A train at High Street, walked into the Bridge Plaza Community Garden, near the borough’s downtown area, with a look of astonishment on his face. “This is the first time I’ve ever been inside,” he said. “I’ve only seen it through the gates.”        
What he saw was one of the jewels in the community-garden system. Hardly bigger than a postage stamp, it somehow manages to accommodate evergreen trees and shrubs, a Japanese maple, hydrangeas and roses, brick and flagstone walkways, and a lily pond stocked with koi.        
A hexagonal wooden bench encircles the garden’s ornamental cherry tree. Off in one corner is a pole with brightly colored birdhouses stacked atop one another, adding a cheery note.        
There are others like it, scattered far and wide. Curtis Jackson, the rapper known as 50 Cent, financed a renovation of a community garden in Jamaica, Queens, his old neighborhood. Now named the Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson Community Garden, it opened in 2008.        
Six deep-blue metal rainwater collectors, 10 feet tall with a dish on top, stand guard over a neat complex of pathways and raised beds with marigolds, sunflowers and vegetables. A pergola entwined with shade-giving trumpet vines runs the length of the garden along 165th Street.        
About 10 blocks away, the Linden Boulevard Community Garden offers a moody contrast, with twisting, moss-covered brick paths that squiggle their way under towering shade trees and past ornamental shrubs like rhododendrons, cherry laurels and Japanese hollies. The colors of spring and summer have faded, but the garden, designed by the parks department veteran Edie Kean, still casts a spell in green.

Previews and Openings 
‘Arguendo’  (in previews; opens on Tuesday) After nearly seven hours of parsing American literature (in the acclaimed “Gatz”), Elevator Repair Service and the Public Theater can be forgiven for shifting their collective attention to something a little racier. Their latest collaboration focuses on a 1991 Supreme Court case about whether exotic dancers ran afoul of a law about public nudity. Elevator Repair Service’s reputation for bold visuals will come into play, but get your mind out of the gutter: the collaborator of note is the visual artist Ben Rubin, who is contributing animated text projections. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Eric Grode)        
‘Bad Jews’  (in previews; opens on Oct. 3) The wonderful Tracee Chimo (“Circle Mirror Tranformation,” “Bachelorette”), as well as Philip Ettinger, Molly Ranson and Michael Zegen, have returned for the remounting of this play, which appeared Off Off Broadway last year at Roundabout Underground’s Black Box Theater. Ms. Chimo gives a sensational performance in Joshua Harmon’s work, portraying a smart, funny and seriously abrasive young woman who is embroiled in a dispute with her cousin over who is entitled to a family heirloom (1:40). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheater.org. (Charles Isherwood)        
‘Big Fish’  (in previews; opens on Oct. 6) Among the season’s more intriguing projects, this musicalization of the 2003 Tim Burton film — about a young man trying to sift through his father’s extremely unreliable stories — garnered rave reviews during its Chicago engagement this spring. Norbert Leo Butz, Kate Baldwin and Bobby Steggert lead the cast; Andrew Lippa (“The Addams Family”) wrote the music and lyrics; and Susan Stroman (who gave Mr. Butz his big break in “Thou Shalt Not”) is the director and choreographer. Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (866) 870-2717, bigfishthemusical.com. (Grode)        
‘Bike America’  (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Oct. 1) Kitchen-sink drama does not appear to be the default mode for Mike Lew, who was last seen giving global finance a madcap spin in 2010’s “Microcrisis.” That was produced by Ma-Yi Theater Company, as is this new piece about a young woman’s cross-country bike trip. This time Mr. Lew has set his play in all 48 contiguous states. Theater at St. Clement’s, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, ma-yitheatre.org. (Grode)        
‘Bronx Bombers’ (in previews; opens on Oct. 8) With football (“Lombardi”) and basketball (“Magic/Bird”) out of the way, Eric Simonson has turned his attention to the great American pastime. And has broadened his scope to cover the entire history of the New York Yankees, from the Babe to Lou to Yogi to the Mick to Reggie to Derek. (If you need last names to make sense of the previous sentence, this is perhaps not the show for you.) The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org. (Grode)        
‘The Film Society’ (in previews; opens on Oct. 1) The Keen Company has earned a reputation for salvaging nearly forgotten works by the likes of Thornton Wilder and Robert Anderson. Now it is focusing on someone a bit more contemporary: Jon Robin Baitz, who’s still going strong with plays like “Other Desert Cities.” His first New York revival, fittingly, is of his first play produced in New York, a 1988 drama set in a South African school for boys. The company’s artistic director, Jonathan Silverstein, will direct Euan Morton and Roberta Maxwell. Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, keencompany.org. (Grode)        
‘The Glass Menagerie’ (in previews; opens on Thursday) This classic Tennessee Williams drama, lavishly honored and about as canonical an American work as they come, returns for its seventh Broadway run after opening there in 1945.

World Maker Faire 


Many parents might blanch at the idea of sending their children to a place where they can learn to pick locks and hack smartphones. But the young people visiting the New York Hall of Science in Queens this weekend won’t be embarking on a life of crime. The principle here is that taking things apart is a great way to grasp how to put things together, and putting things together is what World Maker Faire is all about.        
The event — the fourth to be held in New York City — celebrates the old-fashioned joy of creating objects, whether purely aesthetic, like a giant interactive origami sculpture, or highly engineered and functional, like digitally designed shelters for disaster relief.        
“We found that the model we were creating is like a newfangled county fair, except instead of pigs and pies, it was rockets and robots,” said Sherry Huss, vice president of Maker Media, which publishes Make magazine and held the first Maker Faire in California in 2006. She also describes it as “like Burning Man for families” or, more simply: “Arts fair meets craft fair meets science fair meets farmers’ market.”        
The festival’s Young Makers Pavilion will offer projects like building scooters from scratch, making swords and props from duct tape, constructing 3-D home printers and weaving rugs on huge potholder looms. School-age children can learn to solder (above, a father-son team mastering it last year), and little ones can try elementary woodworking.        
“One of the projects that was most popular last year is Nerdy Derby,” Ms. Huss said, in which children raced improvised toy cars. “They had races with cars made out of food, cars made out of cereal boxes, cars made out of wood.” Nerdy Derby will return this year, along with all manner of robotics, from a Robot Petting Zoo to SpinBots, a children’s workshop to build tiny robots that trace colorful patterns.        
Presented by Disney, the faire — the organizers like the distinctiveness and tradition of the antiquated spelling — will bring more than 650 exhibitors. “We hope kids come with open minds,” Ms. Huss said, because what the Maker Faire most wants to make is more makers.        
(Saturday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, 718-699-0005, makerfaire.com. Tickets: in advance, $30; $25 for ages 62+; $20 for students; $15 for ages 2 through 17; free for under 2; at the door, $5 more. Weekend passes: $55, $45, $35 and $25; at the door, $10 more. On Sunday, for advance purchase only, $70 for a group of five entering before 1 p.m.) LAUREL GRAEBER 
For Children 
‘Archaeology Zone: Discovering Treasures From Playgrounds to Palaces’ (Sunday through Tuesday) Children will step into the shoes of an explorer like Indiana Jones in this permanent exhibition at the Jewish Museum, but the adventures will be purely scholarly. Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show, for ages 3 to 10, also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. From 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; until 8 p.m. on Thursdays; closed all day this Friday for Sukkot and next Thursday for Shemini Atzeret; 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. Free with admission: $12; $10 for 65+; $7.50 for students; free for under 12 and members; pay what you wish on Thursdays from 5 to 8 p.m.        
‘Battle of Harlem Heights Remembered’ (Saturday) Last month, New Yorkers commemorated the Battle of Brooklyn, a 1776 fight nobly waged by Washington’s troops, but a defeat nonetheless. Fortunately, the Battle of Harlem Heights in September of that year turned out better — it was the first Continental Army victory of the Revolutionary War — and it will be celebrated at an appropriate location: the historic Morris-Jumel Mansion, which served as Washington’s headquarters at the time. At this event, children can dress up in colonial costumes, learn how to write with quill pens, search for historical artifacts and meet figures from the mansion’s storied past. From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., 65 Jumel Terrace, between West 160th and 162nd Streets, Washington Heights, (212) 923-8008, morrisjumel.org; free.        
Bronx Native American Festival (Sunday) Ancient music and dance will fill the southern end of Pelham Bay Park in this annual celebration of Indian tribal cultures from North and South America. The renowned storyteller Bobby González will be M.C. for the event, whose performers will also include the Silvercloud Singers, the musician and folklorist Lonnie Harrington and the singer-songwriter Irka Mateo. Children can enjoy arts and crafts, folk tales, face painting and the opportunity to move to the music. From noon to 4 p.m., Picnic Area, South Park, Pelham Bay Park, accessible from Middletown Road and Stadium Avenue, Country Club, the Bronx, (718) 430-1891, nycgovparks.org; free.        
Carroll Park Kids’ Concert Series (Sunday) Sunshine, parks and children all go together, and some Brooklyn organizers have added another harmonious element: music. They will combine for one last time this season on Sunday, when this monthly summer series comes to an end with a huge “We Are Family” dance party. A D.J. will spin vintage disco tunes, followed by a live performance by Mingo and the Metropolis Band NYC. Dance lessons start at 2 p.m., with the band playing at 3:30. From 2 to 5 p.m., Carroll Park, President and Smith Streets, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, carrollparkbrooklyn.org/concerts; free, but donations accepted. (If it rains, the Web site will have updated information.)

                            As the camera ogles the shapely legs of women in high heels strutting down the sidewalks of New York in “Thanks for Sharing,” it is easy to see why such stimulus is more than some men can handle. Neil (Josh Gad), one of three male characters in the film who belong to the same 12-step program for sex addiction, has a habit of spotting an attractive woman in a subway car, sidling up to her and pressing his lower body against hers.        


                            In one incident, the victim appears not to notice until he starts grinding on her, at which point she hauls off and slugs him. In another, he engages an attractive colleague in conversation while surreptitiously filming under her skirt with his smartphone. That ploy gets him fired from his job as an emergency room medic. He is eventually arrested and compelled to join the recovery program.        

                            Neil, a Jack Black type, is the semicomic relief in an otherwise earnest film about the pain of sex addiction. The movie’s dourness is divided between Neil’s sponsor, Adam (Mark Ruffalo), and Adam’s sponsor, Mike (Tim Robbins). But it is not nearly as bleak as Steve McQueen’s “Shame,” whose haunted protagonist prowled a Manhattan that was portrayed as a cold, chic circle of hell filled with overheated flesh.        

                            The sexual compulsions of Adam, who has been in recovery for five years, were so consuming that he banished sex (including masturbation, pornography and television) from his life. Because he is handsome enough to attract any number of beautiful women with just a look, some male viewers may scoff at his rejection of easy conquest. (Remember Warren Beatty’s hairdresser in “Shampoo”? That character sent a message that satyriasis can be groovy, though the story took place near the end of the swinging ’60s.)        

                            Mike, a recovering alcoholic and the group’s self-appointed elder statesman, is married and towing a straight and narrow line. He and his wife, Monica (Joely Richardson), are sitting down to dinner one evening when their estranged son, Danny (Patrick Fugit), appears out of the blue. A longtime drug addict, Danny declares he is clean. But Mike is inclined not to believe him.        

                            “Thanks for Sharing” — the feature directorial debut of Stuart Blumberg, who wrote the screenplay for “The Kids Are All Right” with Lisa Cholodenko — isn’t entirely male-oriented. Joining the recovery group is the tattooed, spiky-haired Dede (Alecia Moore, a k a Pink). Upon turning 30, she realized that the only way she had ever related to men was through sex. She befriends Neil, and they become go-to buddies in times of crisis. They are the fun couple in a movie that has a punishing, grimly puritanical undertone.        

                            The melodrama revolves around Adam and his would-be girlfriend, Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow), whose previous boyfriend was also an addict. Although Phoebe is very open about having survived breast cancer, Adam can’t bring himself to tell her of his compulsion. A garrulous diet and fitness fanatic who loves sex, Phoebe is a handful. After Adam has come clean about his problem, she dons stripper gear and tempts him with a lap dance. It is the last thing in the world he wants because of its association with impersonal pornographic pleasure.        

                            Although the movie touches on some of the possible causes of the characters’ addictions, its tone is uncertain. It notes only in passing that sex addiction is often connected to substance abuse and compulsive overeating. Adam’s inevitable slip suggests a horror movie in which a much younger previous flame, with whom he plays sadomasochistic games, goes suddenly berserk. Neil’s relationship with his suffocatingly adoring mother (Carol Kane), however, is played for farce.        

                            The longstanding strife between Mike and his son is the most resonant story. As they reopen old wounds that will be hard to heal, “Thanks for Sharing” finally gets to the heart of the matter. But most of the rest of the movie never transcends a screenwriting formula that makes you uncomfortably aware of the machinery driving it all.        

“Thanks for Sharing” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has moderately explicit sex scenes and some strong language.

                            If I had anything harsh to say about “McGoldrick’s Thread,” I probably wouldn’t say it. This charming musical, featuring a troupe of talented teenage and preteenage dancers, wants nothing more than to show you a nice time, and it does. Anyone criticizing it sharply should be branded a sourpuss.        


                            The production, part of the 1st Irish Festival, employs a cast of 17 to tell the story of a family living in the Bronx in 1995. Magee, the youngest of this immigrant clan, longs for a new dress to wear to her dance contest, much to the dismay of her parents, who are struggling for money.        

                            Throughout their problems, the family members sing about their past in Ireland, their household traditions and their everyday worries. Step dancing routines are interspersed throughout, prompting whoops and cheers from the audience. Much of the loud, appreciative applause at a recent performance was no doubt from the parents of the young dancers, though some of it came from at least one critic. Ah, why not.        

                            As the shy Magee, Casey Murray, 15, has an appealing stage presence. Her singing voice is gentle and pleasing, her dancing controlled but energetic. Garrett Coleman portrays Eddie, her potential beau. He’s a fierce dancer with a carefree smile. Jason Oremus, as a crusty teacher, also owns a fast set of feet.        

                            Paul Nugent, Conor McIntyre and John Charles McLaughlin, as Magee’s brothers, have splendid comic timing, while Elizabeth West and Peter Cormican, as her parents, exude warmth.        

                            That warmth is important here. The script, by Marianne Driscoll, often veers toward clichés: this Irish family has a penchant for alcohol and spinning tall tales. But the characters radiate enough genuine affection to make such moments forgivable. The modest songs (with lyrics by Ms. Driscoll and Eliot Riskin, and music by Ronnie D’Addario; Patrick Mangan is credited with the dance music) also aim for easy emotional targets that they usually hit.        

“McGoldrick’s Thread,” directed by Kira Simring, at Theater 80, ends just where you’d expect and right where it should, finishing with a final bit of footwork from the youngest cast members. All that stomping is over when the lights go up. But the show’s simple sweetness hangs around a bit longer.

                            During its initial quiet stretch, when about the only things on the screen are a man, his gun and the kind of lonely feeling meant to gnaw at the soul, “A Single Shot” drifts along on its woodsy scenery and vaporous promise. The man, John Moon (a fine Sam Rockwell), lives his spartan existence in a beat-up trailer in the middle of Nowhere, U.S.A. It’s the kind of atmospherically desolate place where, at least in fiction, men and their destinies are rarely alone for long. And so it is for Moon, who soon has to deal with a dead woman and a stash of cash.        


                            Both bring Moon a world of trouble, far more than he or this unpersuasive movie can bear. Directed by David M. Rosenthal and written by Matthew F. Jones (from his 1996 novel), “A Single Shot” has many of the fixings of a classic noir, including bad women, worse men and an existential loner with no obvious exit.        

                            As with some noir heroes, Moon doesn’t just back into trouble: he throws himself right into its pitiless embrace, partly by making all the wrong moves. For starters, he hides the corpse and takes the cash. Then he starts eyeballing a tough-looking local (Jason Isaacs), one of those charmers in black leather with an iron cross tattooed on his neck.        

                            Fatalism can be a beautiful thing in film noir; a character’s apparent stupidity, on the other hand, grows old very quickly. “Build my gallows high, baby,” Robert Mitchum tells Jane Greer in the indelible classic “Out of the Past,” surrendering to the glorious creature who’s the beautiful instrument of his destruction.        

                            But pessimism isn’t Moon’s problem, nor is desire or destiny or overwhelming terminal despair or, well, anything other than underdeveloped narrative and characters. Mr. Rosenthal puts the story’s parts into play well enough, but once everyone and everything is in position that’s more or less where they stay as this slow story downshifts to a crawl.        

                            Moon remains in his trailer, even when it’s clear that he should leave, as everything else around him flails about. Characters make big entrances and exits, yelling and threatening in a hash of movie-made Southern accents.        

                            William H. Macy, as a two-bit lawyer, shows up wearing a lavishly bad toupee while Jeffrey Wright, stumbling and mumbling with a mouth full of marbles, drops by Moon’s trailer with party girls so unindividuated they might as well be blowup dolls. None of these characters, no matter how trashed-up for the down-market occasion, are believable.        

“A Single Shot” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gun violence.

Business,"










WASHINGTON — Sales of existing houses climbed 1.7 percent in August to a six-and-a-half-year high, and factories grew busier in the mid-Atlantic region this month, providing signs that rising borrowing costs are weighing only modestly on the economy.        


The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that existing houses were selling at an annual rate of 5.48 million units, the highest level since early 2007, when a housing bubble was deflating and the economy was sliding toward its deepest recession in decades.        
The report surprised analysts who had expected higher interest rates would lead to a decline in resales. Mortgage rates have risen more than a percentage point since the Federal Reserve’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, hinted in May that the central bank could begin reducing its economic stimulus soon. On Wednesday, however, the Fed said it would maintain its $85 billion monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities        
“Over all, these reports point to a sustained pickup in economic growth momentum,” said Millan Mulraine, an economist at TD Securities.        
The manufacturing sector also is showing signs of brisk growth. Factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region increased by the most in more than two years in September, and firms’ optimism about the future hit a 10-year high, according to a survey conducted by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank.        
The Philadelphia Fed’s business activity index jumped to 22.3 in September, easily beating economists’ expectations for a reading of 10.0. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region’s manufacturing.        
In yet another indication the economy is shrugging off higher borrowing costs, an index of leading indicators advanced by a greater-than-expected 0.7 percent in August, compared with a 0.5 percent rise in July, according to the Conference Board.        
“The economy is grinding its way higher,” said Mark L. Lehmann, president of JMP Securities.        
Many economists, however, contend it is just a matter of time before higher mortgage rates hit the housing market harder.        
“The strong levels of existing home sales in July and August are likely a result of home buyers locking in mortgage rates due to uncertainty about the future trajectory of rates,” economists at Nomura Securities said in a note to clients.        
A separate report from the Labor Department showed the number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits last week held near its lowest levels since before the last recession began in December 2007. Initial jobless claims for state unemployment benefits increased by 15,000, to a seasonally adjusted 309,000, while the four-week moving average slipped by 7,000, to 314,750.        
A report from the Commerce Department showed that an increase in American exports narrowed the country’s current-account deficit in the second quarter to its lowest in four years.        
The current-account deficit, a broad measure of the flow of goods, services and money across national borders, dropped to $98.9 billion in the April-to-June period from a revised $104.9 billion in the previous period.        
The second-quarter level was the lowest since 2009.

                            “After Tiller,” a new documentary by Martha Shane and Lana Wilson, is a partisan document in the culture wars. It could hardly be otherwise, since the film’s subject, abortion, is one where common ground is elusive, if not philosophically untenable. The four doctors interviewed and observed on screen, who the film says are the only ones in the United States openly performing third-trimester abortions, are heroic figures in the filmmakers’ eyes, but are condemned as murderers by those on the other side. It would be nice to believe that a movie like this could provoke civil and respectful dialogue about an intensely polarizing issue, but let’s not kid ourselves.        


                            The four doctors — two in New Mexico, one in Colorado and one in Nebraska — honor the memory of their colleague, George Tiller, who was assassinated in 2009 in Wichita, Kan., where his clinic had been the scene of protests, threats and attacks. Since that killing, and especially since the 2010 elections, a number of states have passed more restrictive abortion laws, Nebraska being one of them. This forces Dr. LeRoy Carhart to find a new place to practice, and his attempts to do so inflame anti-abortion activists in Iowa and in Maryland, where he finally opens a clinic.        

                            While the other doctors — Warren Hern in Boulder, and Susan Robinson and Shelley Sella, who share an office in Albuquerque — do not face that kind of disruption, they contend with continuous picketing and with the hovering, invisible threat of violence. But Ms. Shane and Ms. Wilson are less interested in recapitulating political debates than in understanding how the doctors approach work that would be emotionally difficult and ethically challenging even without the incessant controversy.        

                            Some of the patients who come to them are in the late stages of planned pregnancies and have recently learned of catastrophic fetal anomalies. Others are teenagers who have, through fear, denial or ignorance, allowed their pregnancies to continue past the stage when simpler, more readily available abortions would be possible. In each case, the physicians and the counselors who work with them have to figure out an appropriate course of action. At one point Dr. Robinson and a colleague disagree about whether to help a young woman end her pregnancy even though she identifies herself as “pro-life,” and their exchange is one of the most illuminating discussions I have seen about the complicated reality of abortion.        

                            Documentaries can rarely be judged as works of dispassionate, neutral reporting since few of them aspire to uphold those journalistic criteria. Rather, a documentary should be assessed as a representation of the world as it is, from a perspective that is itself part of that world. “After Tiller” is impressive because it honestly presents the views of supporters of legal abortion, and is thus a valuable contribution to a public argument that is unlikely to end anytime soon.        

“After Tiller” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Discussion of abortion and some profanity.

The Brooklyn Navy Yard is known for its muscular collection of industrial architecture. Here, the battleship Missouri and other warships were built and repaired until the yard closed five decades ago. The regular weekend tours of the Navy Yard cover that and more, but at the end comes an unexpected treat: the magnificent, slightly sagging Naval Hospital, a ghostly marble temple built in 1838 and empty for two decades. A new plan may sweep away the cobwebs.        


The New York Naval Shipyard began building ships in 1806, as the early republic began to build up its navy. In 1838 one of the largest structures opened, the 200-foot-long hospital, on a rise overlooking the yard, but now screened by trees.        
The architect Martin E. Thompson designed a spare C-shaped building of near-white marble, as severe and straight as a nun’s ruler in parochial school. Although two stories in height, the Doric styling and extreme length of the front evokes the taut modernism of the International Style, like Mies van der Rohe’s flat-fronted School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago.        
Before steamships, by the time sailors and Marines injured in places like the Halls of Montezuma got back to the United States any dramatic wounds would have stabilized — or proved fatal — so the Navy probably dealt with invalids rather than the freshly injured. That the hospital had a rural character is suggested by an 1851 ad in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle for a lost “RED COW with a white face,” for which a $5 reward was offered “for her delivery at the hospital.”        
In 1871 The Eagle reported that 32 patients were in house, and that although such a “quiet and comfortable” location might attract malingerers, “the sham is so easily detected” that it was rare. In 1878 The Eagle noted an outbreak of yellow fever, although at least one of the cases was a false alarm, caused by what the newspaper described as “an overdose of very questionable whisky and an inordinate feed of cucumbers.”        
In the Spanish-American War of 1898, the hospital ship Solace delivered to the hospital 43 Marines and sailors from the Cuban campaign, most suffering with diseases like dysentery. One of the actual injured, a Rough Rider named Mason Mitchell, could hardly be accused of malingering; despite a shrapnel wound in the back he hopped a ride with some reporters on their tug and went ashore in Manhattan.        
On the other hand, another trip by the Solace to the hospital carried “men whose faces and heads were bandaged, others whose faces were pale and sunken from long sufferings, men who shuffled about the decks with crutches.”        
In December 1944, The New York Times reported that volunteers were visiting the wounded at both the Navy Yard Hospital and the new St. Albans Naval Hospital in Queens, collecting Christmas shopping lists. The most popular request: “black, lacy and sheer lingerie” from stores like B. Altman and Lord & Taylor.        
After the Navy decommissioned the yard in the 1960s, it held onto the hospital for administrative headquarters. When it did leave, in 1989, the Navy did a conscientious seal-up job, and careful monitoring by the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation has prevented the usual devastation.        
In most cases an empty building in such an isolated position would be a near ruin, but the plywood that covers most the windows is intact, the gutters and roof appear to be in good shape, and there is no graffiti; even the remaining glazed windows in the entry loggia are unbroken. It is a preservation miracle.        
Photographers have occasionally made trips inside, like Richard Nickel Jr., who posts his pictures at his blog, kingstonlounge. They show the entire interior completely coated with a thin coat of whitewash; it looks like a burial shroud. The rooms are empty, except for some fallen plaster and peeling paint, like something from a Stephen King novel, half dream, half nightmare. It isn’t a ruin so much as something you might run across in a haunted lost and found, an architectural orphan.        
Now the Brooklyn Navy Yard Hospital looks as if it might be found. Steiner Studios, a film and television studio, is a major presence in the Navy Yard, and plans to spend $400 million to take over and restore the hospital, constructing additional space for media and tech purposes. Douglas C. Steiner, the chairman, said in an e-mail that he first saw the hospital in 1999 and “it screamed movie studio to me.”        
You cannot just stroll into the Navy Yard, except for the visitor’s center, Building 92 on Flushing Avenue, which has an intriguing exhibition on its long history. That’s where two-hour shuttle bus tours of the yard, operated by Turnstile Tours leave from on Saturdays and Sundays. The hospital is the last stop, and visitors can walk around outside (but not inside). A quiet peace will wash over you as you circle the building through the overgrown grass. It’s rare in the city, and unique in the Navy Yard, otherwise a combination of hipster Silicon Valley high-tech and ragged industrial archaeology. Hurry.

CARACAS, Venezuela — In Caracas, you can live between Danger and Keep Your Eyes Peeled. Or between Hope and Faith, just a short walk from Eternity. At Restaurante Gallegos, one of several restaurants with similar names, prospective diners often call to ask, “Are you the one on Dead Man’s Corner?”        


The city today is a traffic-choked, graffiti-smeared, hyperbolically violent capital where spasmodic bouts of modernization over the years have left little of the colonial charm of some other South American cities. Yet Caracas is also an urban palimpsest, where its past character can still be read amid the concrete.        
Here buildings have names instead of numbers. Yet street names are unknown to many people, including, at times, the name of the street they live on. As a result, asking directions can lead to a long recitation of landmarks, like a Hemingway short story: “Go past the pharmacy to the top of the hill till you see the big tree and turn right. ...”        
And in one of this city’s most endearing quirks, the street corners themselves have names, often ones that point to a colorful history.        
“In all of Venezuela there’s only one Dead Man’s Corner,” said José Goncalves, 77, the owner of a butcher shop there. On a map, Mr. Goncalves’s shop is at the intersection of East 14 and South 5 Avenues. But no one, he said, uses those names. If he needs to tell someone where his shop is, he simply says to look for him on Dead Man’s Corner.        
“That never fails me,” he said. Even his telephone bill comes addressed that way.        
As with many of the intersections in this part of Caracas, there are multiple stories, or legends, to explain how Dead Man’s Corner got its name. A customer in Mr. Goncalves’s store one recent morning declared that many years ago a dying man asked to have his wake held at that intersection.        
Not so, said Mr. Goncalves, who has owned the shop for 38 years.        
There used to be a brass plaque on the outside of his building, he said, put up by the city to tell the story — although, this being Caracas, it was stolen long ago. The plaque, he recalled, said that there had been a deadly epidemic in the city. Soldiers were sent out to collect the dead, and as they were passing this spot with a cart piled with bodies, one of the supposed cadavers sat up and cried out to let people know he was not as dead as he seemed.        
Another version, told in a book called “The Corners of Caracas,” published in the 1950s, says that the name is derived from one of the civil wars that ravaged Venezuela in the 19th century. A battle between rival bands left the dead rotting in the streets. As some soldiers were carrying what they thought was a corpse to the cemetery, the man sat up in the stretcher and said, “Don’t take me to be buried, because I’m alive.” The panicked soldiers, the book says, dropped their load and dashed off.        
The names, which apply to all the corners at an intersection, are found only in the center of the city, in an area radiating from the old colonial main square. A popular pocket-size book of maps says there are 305 of them.        
Some corners fit their names.        
Misery Corner is down at heel. A building painted bright green and yellow stands at Parrot Corner. The main office of the national prosecutor is halfway between Mercy and Keep Your Eyes Peeled.        
Others corners do not.        
On a recent morning two drunks fought, flailing at each other ineffectually, at the corner known as Eternity. The Corner of the Upside-Down Christ is wholly nondescript (the legend goes that a shoemaker whose shop was once there was short on work, so, following local tradition, he turned a small statue of Christ in his workshop upside down to “punish” it for not sending him more clients).        
Some corners come in groups.        
A person walking along South 15 Avenue (almost certainly unaware of the street name) will go past a series of corners in this order: Checkpoint Corner, Danger Corner and Keep Your Eyes Peeled. In past years the walker could have gone one block farther to reach Off With Your Underpants Corner, which was eliminated when a school was built on the spot.

To enter the world of the singer-songwriter Laura Nyro is to open a time capsule evoking the concentrated sounds, sights and turbulence of New York City in the late 1960s. The voice behind them was the wail of an emotionally unguarded young woman touched with genius, who was still in her teens when she composed many of her most famous songs.        


While listening to Grace Cosgrove sing Nyro’s catalog in her show “To Laura With Love” at the Metropolitan Room on Wednesday evening, I had many you-are-there moments, picturing Nyro, who died at 49 in 1997, as a colorfully attired, hippie street princess, dancing down Broadway in a trance. Nyro’s fusions of folk, R&B, jazz and show tunes were kaleidoscopic blasts of feeling that ignored the rules of conventional songwriting to go wherever their turbulent emotions carried them.        
Ms. Cosgrove, who was accompanied by piano, bass, guitar and two backup singers, doesn’t have Nyro’s vocal clout. The one singer to come close to capturing that sound has been Rickie Lee Jones. But Ms. Cosgrove projected a deep understanding of Nyro’s song lyrics, most of which were the expressions of a brilliant, rebellious teenager breaking free of all constraints to assert herself, whatever the cost.        
The material was divided into sections. Wild euphoria (“Stoned Soul Picnic, “Sweet Blindness”) gave way to the agonized responses of a vulnerable romantic. It ended with reflections on death. The strongest section, during which Ms. Cosgrove steadily gained in confidence, was a sequence of songs excoriating male fecklessness. The crowning number, “Eli’s Comin’ ” is an alarmed warning to every woman in sight that a heartbreaker has been spotted in the vicinity and must be avoided at all costs; the fox is about to enter the henhouse.        
Of all the female singer-songwriters who came of age in the late 1960s, Nyro was the most overtly feminist. Women and children occupy one side of the playing field, and men the other, and coexistence, however tempting, is perilous. The fact that Ms. Cosgrove is over 40 is a sign that Nyro’s songs, however “young,” still speak to the moment.        



 
Grace Cosgrove performs again on Sept. 29 and Oct. 17 at the Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Flatiron district; (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com.

With its radiators and unadorned brick, the small Chocolate Factory theater can be a stark, impersonal setting. For Megan V. Sprenger’s “Flutter,” which had its debut on Wednesday, the designer Brad Kisicki has softened the place up a bit. A white panel floats in front of the back wall, and wide bands of white gauze arch up the sides of the room and across the ceiling. There’s a suggestion of a wedding, and also of bandages. The hard facts are only partly hidden.        


Four dancers dressed in white strike angular poses at the rear. They are like art objects, but also like a police lineup, arrayed for the audience’s inspection. Gradually they advance, eventually drawing close enough to be touched (though no one touches them). Looking at their viewers or at one another, their eyes appear to welcome contact at one moment and to shy from it the next.        
Moving independently, they become distinct as individuals. Tara O’Con seems the most at ease with herself, pleased by a secret, bending her compact form, claiming space in spirals. Michael Ingle is big, gentle, slow to reveal his more compelling oddities and drives. Anna Adams Stark is unruly, awkward, defensive with an uplifted chin. Donna Cicchesi is a seductress in body language, but beneath her bangs, her eyes keep retreating to the side. She tends to stay out of everyone else’s way.        
Much of the time, each performer does his or her own thing, all at once, but the interactions among them take on drama. The work is highly episodic, a structure emphasized by Joe Levasseur’s lighting, subtly cooling and warming, and by Jason Sebastian’s sound design, shifting among buzzes, guitar figures and sometimes a beat.        
Though all four dancers occasionally come together, in stillness or in bursts of motion, the most intense encounters occur in pairs. Two people build some pattern in common until one of them breaks off. Two people almost touch but keep a tiny distance, or they do touch and the touching turns violent. Someone comes away smug, someone comes away hurt.        
Playing against more abstract elements, the interpersonal drama intrigues. The work is skillfully shaped and paced. Yet, despite its compositional sophistication, there’s something adolescent about it all, something high school, like a white-on-white abstraction of “The Breakfast Club.”        
The identifying mannerisms — like Ms. Cicchesi’s tentative raising of her hand, as in class — grow irritating with repetition. What at first seems to reveal character eventually becomes a wall. That happens in life, too, but as art, I found it dispiriting. The dancers leave the space one by one, alone. I wish I had been more sorry to see them go.        



 
“Flutter” continues through Saturday at the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens; (866) 811-4111, chocolatefactorytheater.org. 
 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 20, 2013An earlier version of a sub-heading with this review misstated the surname of the choreographer of “Flutter.” As the review correctly noted, she is Megan V. Sprenger, not Spengler.

                            Randy singles and body doubles drive the party-down plot of “+1,” a fleet and frenzied sci-fi tale with more on its mind than alien gate-crashers.        


                            The setting is an extravagant college kegger in a blinged-out family mansion. Club beats pulse and booze flows; barely clad young women wander from room to room; and hired strippers writhe and shimmy on an outdoor stage. One meteor crash later, and Teddy (Logan Miller), lounging in postcoital bliss watching his lover shower, is shocked to encounter her replica. Does she have a twin? Are the kegs spiked with hallucinogens?        

                            But the director, Dennis Iliadis — whose unnerving 2009 remake of “The Last House on the Left” exhibited a similar interest in primal instincts — would rather poke psyches than pursue an extraterrestrial mystery. Breaking timelines and fracturing identities, he wonders what would happen if we could witness almost instant replays of our sometimes moronic behavior. And as the guests gradually realize that perfect copies of themselves are partying a mere 15 minutes behind, he hits a philosophical mother lode.        

                            “You make me feel disposable,” one young woman tells her cheating boyfriend, and the film takes this notion of casual obsolescence seriously. Pondering the implications, Bill Gullo’s dark, provocative script eventually loses ideological steam, finding refuge in a reliably depressing human response to things we don’t understand.        

                            Until that point, however, the movie’s boldness and horrifying logic get under your skin. In its creepiest scene, a young man moves away from a mirror, leaving a shadowy clone hovering behind. A warning to think before we act or risk being overtaken by ourselves, Version 2.0?

GAFFNEY, S.C. — The old textile mills here are mostly gone now. Gaffney Manufacturing, National Textiles, Cherokee — clangorous, dusty, productive engines of the Carolinas fabric trade — fell one by one to the forces of globalization.        
Just as the Carolinas benefited when manufacturing migrated first from the Cottonopolises of England to the mill towns of New England and then to here, where labor was even cheaper, they suffered in the 1990s when the textile industry mostly left the United States.         "

                            The miracle of the new 3-D dance film “Battle of the Year” is how it can be so relentlessly boring while there is so much frenetic activity on screen. Despite the break-dance spins and disorienting strobe lights in the performance scenes, the movie feels sluggish throughout.        


                            It cannot be revived by the bombastic music — more appropriate for a space or military epic — that underscores every dramatic scene. The most successful sections are training montages in which three frames of different scenes float across the screen at once. Because you cannot focus on any one thing, your eyes are tricked into the illusion of information conveyed, as in flipping channels.        

                            Despite having names like Sniper, Lil Adonis and Mayhem, virtually none of the characters are memorable. Perhaps this is appropriate in a film in which the American dance team members are taught by their coach (Josh Holloway) not to use the word “I.” Instead they are instructed to use the royal “we.”        

                            The only one who stands out is played by Chris Brown (more known for his music and a history of domestic abuse than for his acting). Blond and brooding as Rooster, Mr. Brown plays an arrogant, insolent young man engaged in an inane Twitter war with another dancer. With his constant dull scowl, he is very successful at playing unlikable.        

                            Josh Peck is seemingly miscast as the comic relief in his role as the assistant coach. Instead, he brings a welcome sweetness to this film about unpleasant people who move around a lot. But Mr. Peck’s hoarse, sensitive whisper is used to say lines about how Jews like him are “stripped of our swag at the circumcision.” He also responds, “Seriously?” to endless slights in his role as the stereotypical nebbish.        

“Battle of the Year” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for language and some rude behavior.

                            In the world of “C.O.G.,” the first movie adaptation of a David Sedaris essay, self-knowledge is best gained among simple folks, preferably those defined by outsize quirks and nutty pronouncements. At least that’s what David (Jonathan Groff), an arrogant Yalie, learns when he boards a bus to Oregon to bury his fingers — and his unacknowledged homosexuality — in the soil.        


                            As clueless about people as he is about nature (“Do cows look forward to things?” he wonders, trying to feed them cold cuts), David begins his Steinbeckian interlude picking apples for a crusty farmer (Dean Stockwell). Wrapped in a mantle of atheism, privilege and cultural ignorance, David alienates his prayerful Mexican co-workers, faring no better with the others who cross his prejudiced path. In this hamlet, however, there’s more than enough bigotry to go around.        

                            Despite smatterings of wit and a stable of skilled performers, “C.O.G.” struggles to find a consistent tone, its episodic structure veering from farcical to poignant to dangerously raw. As David experiments with religion (the title stands for “child of God”) and bounces from one weirdo to another — including a too friendly forklift operator (Corey Stoll) and a recovering alcoholic (Denis O’Hare) with equal love for Jesus and jade clocks — his encounters begin benignly but darken quickly.        

                            At the same time, the script (by the director, Kyle Patrick Alvarez) leaves his motivations and personal history undivulged, and the normally appealing Mr. Groff with little to play but faintly superior befuddlement. The result is a character as distant from the audience as he is from everyone else in the movie.        

“C.O.G.” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Obscene language, reprehensible behavior and a bus ride from hell.

“The Colony” is two-thirds of a pretty good sci-fi suspense movie. But it eventually takes a disappointing turn and becomes yet another run-from-the-ghouls exercise, cheapening decent work by a good cast.        


                            Efforts to tinker with the weather have somehow plunged Earth into a perpetual winter, and humanity has survived only in a few scattered colonies underground. The inhabitants of one are struggling with food shortages and internal disagreements over governing, especially how to handle residents who come down with diseases that might spread to others. Briggs (Laurence Fishburne) is trying to maintain some compassion, while Mason (Bill Paxton) favors a more ruthless line.        

                            The colony has an alliance with another that is within hiking distance, and a distress call from that group sends Briggs, Sam (Kevin Zegers) and Graydon (Atticus Dean Mitchell) trudging through the cold to see if they can help. The mission, the power struggles back home and the slowly proffered tidbits about what the heck happened to the climate make for an intriguing mix, and the actors sell it nicely.        

                            But when the three would-be rescuers reach the neighboring colony, the story degenerates into something resembling a zombie flick. That undoes everything that has come before, because we all know how such encounters end: many people die; a few don’t. No suspense there.

                            Did you hear the one about the gentile and the Jew? The gentile guy, he’s drawn only to Jewish women, see, so he has his childhood buddy — who’s Jewish! — help him fit the skullcap, so to speak, the better to find romance. First a play, now a movie, it’s “Jewtopia”!        


                            But a funny thing happens to that gentile and that Jew. They’re not so funny. Onstage, in the sketch of a script by Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the young dudes at least find a certain zippy banter. On screen, where visuals reign and the simple pleasures of language are less paramount, the expanded “Jewtopia” is just a flat premise, uncomfortable not only because the clichés are groaners, but also because you feel sorry for everyone who’s working so hard to prop up the farce — especially Mr. Fogel, the director, whose work seems alternately desperate and lost.        

                            The movie’s supporting players are surprisingly well cast, with Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jon Lovitz, Wendie Malick, Jamie-Lynn Sigler and Rita Wilson all eking out a moment or more of comic commitment. Actually, Mr. Lovitz is the unlikely most valuable player. Two others, Tom Arnold and the great Camryn Manheim, only raise hopes — neither has a chance to make much of an impression.        

                            Most of “Jewtopia” (it kind of creeps me out to keep repeating that) is left to the leading players, Joel David Moore (the Jew, Adam) and Ivan Sergei (the gentile, appropriately named Christian). It doesn’t go well for them. Sure, it’s a tough joke to tell, and they had a very bad setup, but together they flub the delivery.

                            “Every single solitary Butterball turkey in the United States of America has been sacrificed to Allah,” a conservative commentator says of halal meat in the montage that opens “The Muslims Are Coming!” Directed by the comedians Negin Farsad and Dean Obeidallah, the documentary begins strongly with this collection of absurd hatemongering, cobbled from television clips. Unfortunately, the film peaks in those first few minutes.        


                            The movie follows a group of Muslim-American comedians (who include Ms. Farsad and Mr. Obeidallah, documenting themselves) on a peace tour across the country to promote awareness. They travel in two cars to small towns and large cities to perform stand-up and also to stage goofy stunts — for instance, setting up an “Ask a Muslim” booth or holding a “Hug a Muslim” sign. Interspersed are interviews with the comedians and with better-known figures like Jon Stewart, David Cross and Rachel Maddow.        

                            The film lingers on details of the tour — a filthy motel or one comedian’s obsessive search for Snapple — at the expense of the stand-up routines. And the message seems muddled when the jokes include how Ms. Farsad’s Iranian mother distrusts blacks. Is the assurance that those who experience bigotry are also bigoted a way to deflate prejudice? Perhaps. After all, comedy is subjective. But I didn’t find it convincing. Nor was I impressed by the occasional cheap jokes lobbed at provincial attitudes in Southern and Midwestern small towns.        

                            Mr. Stewart is more insightful and amusing in his commentary: for instance, when he wryly says that anti-Muslim sentiment is “not ignorance born of hate but ignorance born of ignorance.” Unlike Mr. Stewart and “The Daily Show,” this well-intentioned “docu-comedy” (as the filmmakers label it in publicity notes) is not very funny.

New York City’s unemployment rate rose to 8.6 percent in August, despite stronger than usual hiring at the end of the summer, according to reports released on Thursday.        


The rise in the unemployment rate, from 8.4 percent in July, reflects an increase in the number of people looking for work in the city, said Barbara Byrne Denham, a private economist who analyzes the official data issued every month by the State Labor Department.        
Ms. Denham estimated that employers in the city added 10,200 jobs last month, bringing the total gain for the year so far to nearly 85,000 jobs. The city is on pace to add at least 100,000 jobs in 2013, she said, the biggest increase in a year since 1999.        
“The good news is the gains were really across the board,” said Ms. Denham, who works for Eastern Consolidated, a real estate services firm in Manhattan. Ms. Denham performs her own calculations to adjust the Labor Department’s figures for seasonal fluctuations in hiring and firing. The department seasonally adjusts the statewide jobs data, but not the city numbers.        
The persistently high unemployment rate has bedeviled Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other city officials. On Tuesday, one of Mr. Bloomberg’s deputies, Robert K. Steel, appeared on CNBC to trumpet the strength of the city’s economy. He said the city had gained back twice as many jobs as it lost during the financial crisis that started five years ago.        
Ms. Denham agreed with those numbers. By her count, the city lost about 165,000 jobs in the recession, but gained back all of them plus an additional 150,000 jobs.        
She too discounted the rising unemployment rate, attributing it to an increase in the number of New Yorkers encouraged about the prospects for finding jobs. The labor force tends to grow when the economy gains steam and hopes of getting hired rise; people without jobs count as unemployed only when they are actively looking for one.        
“I think there’s a lot more optimism in the economy,” Ms. Denham said.        
Wall Street, which has traditionally led the city’s economy out of recessions, was an exception to the positive trend in August. The securities industry lost about 1,700 jobs last month, leaving it with a net loss so far this year, Ms. Denham said.        
Elena Volovelsky, an economist with the State Labor Department, said the number of jobs in computer systems design and advertising in the city rose to “all-time employment highs” in August. She said that the financial industries were weak, but that some of those job losses could have resulted from summer interns’ returning to school.        
Statewide, the number of private-sector jobs increased by 22,700 in August, the department reported. The state’s unemployment rate also rose, to 7.6 percent last month from 7.5 percent in July. The national unemployment rate is lower, at 7.3 percent for August.        
In New Jersey last month, the numbers moved in the opposite direction: the state lost jobs, but its unemployment rate dipped. The Department of Labor and Workforce Development reported on Thursday that the state’s unemployment rate declined to 8.5 percent in August, from 8.6 percent in July. But it also said that the number of jobs in the state declined by 1,500, making for a two-month loss since June of 12,000 jobs.        
According to the official definitions, there were about 392,000 unemployed residents of New Jersey and more than 730,000 in New York State, about half of which lived in New York City.

Winery by winery, grape by grape, Long Island’s overall portfolio and versatility are gradually broadening.        


Marking its 30th anniversary in the regional industry’s 40th year, Paumanok Vineyards, in Aquebogue, is releasing its first sparkling wine, a captivating, light, dry 2009 blanc de blanc ($45). It grew the chardonnay grapes, and Eric Fry did the cellar work at the Lenz Winery, in Peconic.        
Lenz, long a specialist in gewürztraminer, blended that grape with pinot gris — both have Alsatian backgrounds — in a new 2011 white named Tête-à-Tête ($25). It has an appetite-whetting grapefruity zip.        
Channing Daughters, in Bridgehampton, is rolling out a 2012 ribolla gialla ($35) made with the winery’s own fruit. This white variety, a rarity in America, is found most prominently in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, a region in northeastern Italy.        
James Christopher Tracy, Channing Daughters’ winemaker, also created the 2011 Dorn & Blau ($28), a savory red blend of 68 percent Dornfelder, a German grape, and 32 percent blaufränkisch, which is widely planted in Austria. (His fruit originated in Mudd West Vineyard, in Hallockville, on the North Fork.) Concentrated and sultry, it offers a hint of black currants.        
The prospects for grüner veltliner, one of Austria’s main white grapes, in Suffolk County have been significantly heightened by the 2012 and 2011 versions (each $20) from One Woman Wines and Vineyards, in Southold. They form an instructive study in contrasting vintages: though both are typically peppery, the 2012 is upbeat, light and refined, while the 2011 is dense and mouth-filling.        
Macari Vineyards, in Mattituck, introduced and sold out its first, small, trial vintage of grüner veltliner, a vivacious 2012, using fruit from an upstate Seneca Lake grower. It won a silver medal at the yearly New York State wine contest in August. That quick success helps explain why Alexandra Macari, an owner, expects to produce a greater volume of the wine this year.

Candace Pert, a neuroscientist who helped discover a fundamental element of brain chemistry as a graduate student and went on to become a major proponent of alternative medicine, died on Sept. 12 at her home in Potomac, Md. She was 67.        


The cause was cardiac arrest, said her sister, Deane Beebe.        
Dr. Pert was working at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in the 1970s when a team she was on found one of the most sought-after objects in brain research: the receptor in the brain that opiates like morphine fit into, like a key in a lock, allowing the drug’s effects to work.        
The discovery of the opioid receptor would, in 1978, earn the coveted Albert Lasker Award, often a precursor to the Nobel Prize. The award went to Solomon H. Snyder, who headed the lab. Neither Dr. Pert nor any of the other lab assistants was cited.        
Such omissions are common in the world of science; the graduate student in the lab rarely gets credit beyond being the first name on the papers describing the research. But Dr. Pert did something unusual: she protested, sending a letter to the head of the foundation that awards the prize, saying she had “played a key role in initiating the research and following it up” and was “angry and upset to be excluded.”        
Her letter caused a sensation in the field. Some saw her exclusion as an example of the burdens and barriers women face in science careers.        
In a 1979 article about Dr. Pert in the The Washington Post, Dr. Snyder, who had lauded Dr. Pert’s contributions in his Lasker acceptance speech, argued that “that’s the way the game is played,” adding that today’s graduate students will be tomorrow’s lab chiefs, and that “when they have students, it will be the same.”        
The two later reconciled. In an e-mail interview on Wednesday, Dr. Snyder, now a professor in the Solomon H. Snyder Department of Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins, called Dr. Pert “one of the most creative, innovative graduate students I had ever mentored.”        
Dr. Pert continued her career at the National Institute of Mental Health, where she continued to do pioneering work on receptors and the peptides that correspond to them, coming to conclusions that steered her toward alternative medicine.        
She became a leading proponent of the unity of mind and body, and the ability of emotions to affect health. When Bill Moyers, in a 1993 PBS special, “Healing and the Mind,” asked her, “Are you saying that the mind talks to the body, so to speak, through these neuropeptides?” she answered, “Why are you making the mind outside of the body?” She was also featured prominently in the 2004 film “What the #$*! Do We Know!?” which attempted to bridge science and spirituality.        
In her best-known book, “Molecules of Emotion: The Science Behind Mind-Body Medicine,” published in 1997, Dr. Pert advocated a more holistic approach to understanding health.        
“I’ve come to believe that virtually all illness, if not psychosomatic in foundation, has a definite psychosomatic component,” she wrote. The “molecules of emotion,” she argued, “run every system in our body,” creating a “bodymind’s intelligence” that is “wise enough to seek wellness” without a great deal of high-tech medical intervention.        
The author Deepak Chopra, who wrote the foreword to “Molecules of Emotion,” called the book a “landmark in our understanding of the mind body connection.” Dr. Miles Herkenham, a former colleague at the National Institute of Mental Health, said that it may seem odd to an outside observer that a scientist of Dr. Pert’s training would go into what he called the “squishy world” of alternative medicine. But “the common theme that underlies all of her work is her knowledge as a pharmacologist of ligands — peptides — and how they work through receptors,” he said, adding, “She followed her own passions.”        
Her work led Dr. Pert to team up with her husband, Dr. Michael Ruff, an immunologist, to investigate another protein, peptide T. They hoped that it would be effective in fighting H.I.V. by blocking the entry of the virus into cells. While the drug showed promise, it has not led to a successful treatment. Dr. Pert published more than 250 scientific papers on peptides.        
In more recent years she and Dr. Ruff founded a company, Rapid Pharmaceuticals, that is developing peptide-based drugs to treat Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular disease and other diseases by fighting the inflammation that underlies many chronic medical conditions.        
Candace Beebe was born on June 26, 1946, in Manhattan. Her father, Robert, was a commercial artist, and her mother, Mildred, worked in the courts as a clerk typist. She graduated with a degree in biology from Bryn Mawr College and earned a doctorate in pharmacology from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She also became interested in psychology but ultimately sought a more solid scientific basis for behavior.        
“I wanted there to be a field that looked for the biochemical substrate of psychology,” she said. “That field didn’t really exist at the time. But I began to search for it, and it began to exist.”        
Her first marriage, to Agu Pert, a fellow researcher, ended in divorce; they had three children, Brandon, Evan and Vanessa Pert Haneberg, all of whom survive her. Besides her sister, Ms. Beebe, and Dr. Ruff, she is survived by a grandson.        
One of the friends scheduled to speak at Dr. Pert’s memorial service, planned for late October, is Solomon Snyder.

A couple of decades ago, Chinese restaurants were as ubiquitous as Italian ones. Nearly every town on Long Island had at least one. Today, Japanese, fusion and pan-Asian spots have taken their place. Maru Asian Cuisine in St. James is a recent example of the trend, in name at least.        


The restaurant opened in March in the space formerly occupied by Lotus East, one of the island’s top Chinese restaurants for 25 years. Jia Liu, a first-time restaurateur, bought it from its original owners last fall and began to offer teriyakis, pad thai and shrimp Bali style as specials. In May, he created a new menu incorporating these and other pan-Asian offerings, though a majority of the dishes are still Chinese.        
Maru looks much like the old Lotus East. The spacious dining room features Chinese statues and paintings and a ceiling hung with red Chinese lanterns. Floors are carpeted; the chair cushions are red and gold silk, and the tablecloths and napkins are pale pink.        
As in old-school Chinese restaurants, crispy noodles arrive at the table accompanied by hot mustard and duck sauce. Maru also sends out a complimentary salad of mixed greens, cucumber, tomato and carrot in a ginger dressing — a nice touch.        
Unfortunately, Maru does not live up to Lotus East when it comes to the food. Our meals had ups and downs, with almost equal numbers of successes and failures. Service was pleasant but sometimes confused; a language barrier may have been an issue in some cases.        
For a splendid start to a meal, order shrimp toast, four triangles of crispy goodness. Running a close second were the crunchy Vietnamese spring rolls, slim cylinders filled with shredded vegetables. Edamame, liberally sprinkled with salt, were another plus.        
But avoid the gyoza. They contained shrimp, not the usual pork, and the filling was mushy with a strong fishy taste. Barbecue ribs were flavorful but tough. Chicken lettuce wraps were tasty, but were missing the crunch of water chestnuts; they also lacked the usual accompaniment of hoisin sauce, which might have sparked their flavor.        
The best entree we sampled was shrimp Bali style, a stir-fry of seafood and vegetables (baby corn, peppers, peapods and mushrooms) in a flavor-packed brown sauce with Thai seasonings. Pad thai, moist and not overly sweet, was also above average. A surprise hit was flaky and moist steamed salmon with an assertive scallion and ginger sauce.        
However, Singapore chow mei fun, a favorite that I have tasted in every Chinese restaurant that has offered it, was a dud. The angel-hair pasta had none of the characteristic curry flavor. In fact, it had no flavor at all, only heat from red peppers.        
Speaking of heat, shredded pork in garlic sauce, requested mild, was the spiciest version I have ever tasted. Sliced beef with scallions was tender and tasty, but mango chicken was overly sweet.        
Dessert is even more limited here than it is at many Asian restaurants. The menu lists fried bananas, fried ice cream, fried cheesecake and litchis, but none were available on our visits; the only choices were ice cream or pineapple chunks. The ice cream was ordinary; we passed on the pineapple.        
Drivers on North Country Road will see the big new sign for Maru Asian Cuisine, but they will also see signs on the outside walls and on the awning that say Lotus East. People answering the phone recently still said “Lotus East,” but don’t be fooled: While Maru has some good dishes, it is not in the same league as its predecessor.

Wobbling, blissed out, a few in tears, people emerged every 12 minutes or so from the remnant of a 12th-century Spanish chapel tucked into the Cloisters museum.        


Something had happened there, up on a hill at the northern end of Manhattan.        
“It’s too soon to talk,” Margaret Cardenas said as she left the chapel.        
“Too raw,” said another young woman, Alyssa.        
Inside the ancient chapel was the first presentation of contemporary art ever at the Cloisters: “The Forty Part Motet,” an 11-minute immersion in a tapestry of voice, each thread as vivid as the whole fabric. A sacred composition of Renaissance England is rendered by the multimedia artist Janet Cardiff through 40 speakers — one for each voice in the Salisbury Cathedral Choir, which performed the piece in 2000. What started as one microphone per singer is now a choir of black high-fidelity speakers arrayed in an oval, eight groupings of soprano, alto, tenor, baritone and bass.        
In the intimate space of the museum’s Fuentidueña Chapel, the sound, from invisible people, as if from ghosts, feels like charged, living sculpture. Through Dec. 8, it plays in a loop all day.        
Ms. Cardenas, 24, had stayed in the chapel through four full cycles, walking along the ranks of speakers, then sitting on a bench in the center.        
“I’m kind of out of it — I can’t articulate it,” she said. “Each speaker is a different person. It’s not something you think about: you feel it.”        
In a moment, she found the word.        
“Transcendent,” she said.        
Ms. Cardenas was visiting the East Coast from Oregon for a wedding, and came to New York this week specifically to see a monumental installation by James Turrell in the rotunda of the Guggenheim Museum. Then she heard about the Forty Part Motet and trekked uptown. “This is cooler, honestly, than Turrell,” Ms. Cardenas said. “I was super fortunate to get to see both.”        
Others stumbled onto the “Forty Part Motet” while doing a lap around the city museum circuit. No one who sets foot inside the Cloisters can miss the sounds; although they are at their most powerful within the jeweled acoustic space of the chapel, they soar through the building.        
“We had no idea it was here, and then we heard it all along as we went around the exhibits,” said Bengt Ehlim, who was visiting the city from Sweden with his wife, Susanne. She seemed to be stepping out of a trance.        
“I am so really moved,” Ms. Ehlim said.        
The core of Ms. Cardiff’s installation is a motet, “Spem in Alium,” a Latin fragment of the phrase “In No Other Is My Hope,” composed by Thomas Tallis sometime in the 16th century. Its transformation into the “Forty Part Motet” has been exhibited at MoMA PS1, the museum’s space in Long Island City, Queens.        
“I’d seen it at MoMA, and the gallery was very neutral,” Jeff Gray, 33, a computer programmer and musician, said outside the chapel. “But there’s nothing like this kind of space, the resonance of brick with wood roof. The kind of ghost qualities are a lot more apparent here. Everything bounces a lot more: you hear a voice over here, and you kind of feel it float around you.”        
He was accompanied by Etta Yuki, who works in independent film. The sensations, she guessed, were what the director of an orchestra would feel. “And seeing it in a place like this puts it in a spiritual context,” Ms. Yuki, 36, said.        
Sampled from the familiar, the sum of the ancient sound and space arrives in modern ears and eyes like nothing else: not like hearing a church choir, not like listening to music on a superb sound system.        
“I’ve sung in English church choirs, and I know what it’s like to be in a space with 40 people and singing something like this,” Norman Yamada, 50, a composer and high baritone, said. This was a different, slightly unsettling experience, he said; acoustically “dry” sound was reconstituted. “By close-mikeing each singer, you’ve got it very dry,” he said. “Then you put it back in this space, and it takes the coloring of the space.”        
The space, of course, takes its coloring from history. The Fuentidueña Chapel was part of a castle-fortress complex in Segovia during the hundreds of years of war between Muslims and Christians in Spain. Ms. Ehlim, the Swedish visitor, had made the journey from her accommodations in the hectic East Village to the Cloisters looking for the opposite of war. “My sister told me this is a lovely place to go if you want to have some peace in New York,” Ms. Ehlim said.        
A new color.

“My Lucky Star,” a spy-caper romance from China, is sweet and harmless, but it’s also a little disorienting. After watching it, you may need a few moments to remember which decade this is, because the film has the tone and silliness of a “Pink Panther” movie or an episode of the 1960s sitcom “Get Smart.”        


Zhang Ziyi reprises her role as Sophie from the 2009 Chinese hit “Sophie’s Revenge,” playing an illustrator who daydreams about being in the adventures she draws but in reality is stuck in a bland life. Here, she is improbably caught up in the search for a stolen diamond, though not just any diamond. This one is huge and also has the power to be weaponized, becoming the fuel, essentially, for a device that can destroy a city.        

                            The secret agent who sweeps her up into this adventure, David (Leehom Wang), is a dreamboat right out of one of her drawings, but Sophie proves to be rather inept at the espionage game, resulting in all sorts of madcap complications. The film has an American director, Dennie Gordon, and the humor has a quality American audiences will recognize. In one scene, the two leads escape from pursuers with a leap from a tall building as David deploys a parachute from out of nowhere.        

                            “Where’d the parachute come from?” Sophie asks, as they drift safely downward. “Can I buy it online?”

                            On a cuteness scale — where 10 is a fuzzy kitten yawning in a hammock — the chattily uninhibited 7- and 8-year-old golfers of “The Short Game” score high. One moment, these skilled children are tirelessly practicing swings, rain or shine; another moment, they’re saying that Dad should marry Lady Gaga, or beaming over a book about breaking wind. Discipline exists alongside child’s play, on and off the green.        


                            Josh Greenbaum’s documentary prizes these contrasts as it follows eight competitors at the 2012 U.S. Kids Golf World Championship in Pinehurst, N.C. “Spellbound,” the 2003 spelling bee chronicle that helped jump-start the theatrical market for nonfiction last decade, is an obvious model. Mr. Greenbaum is even more intent on delivering snappily edited portraits in ambition and athleticism.        

                            The children are introduced, as people are in reality shows, with framed one-liners and held-for-a-beat bits of business: a pink-loving Texas girl with her stuffed bunnies; a pale French boy reading poetry aloud. After these sketches, some individuals and their obsessive parents are fleshed out more than others. Allan Kournikova, younger brother to the tennis-playing Anna, is one. Coolly talented, nearly bratty, he spouts sports interview platitudes and (less coherently) nutrition cant.        

                            Mr. Greenbaum shapes the drama of tournament play with a heavy hand, pushing suspense that doesn’t always add up or leaning on pop songs. He’s observant of tears and laughter alike, but he might have made fewer sacrifices in the name of a tidy package.        

“The Short Game” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some expressions of frustration on the field of battle.

Armed Russian Coast Guard officers boarded a Greenpeace ship that was circling an Arctic oil platform on Thursday after Moscow accused the environmentalist group of “aggressive and provocative” behavior. Greenpeace International said in a statement that “activists locked inside the radio room said they saw other activists detained on their knees with guns pointed at them.” Two Greenpeace activists scaled the side of the Gazprom-owned Prirazlomnaya platform on Wednesday and were arrested because they threatened security, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. Moscow summoned the Dutch ambassador to discuss the issue. Greenpeace is based in the Netherlands, and its ship, Arctic Sunrise, which had 25 people aboard, is a Dutch-registered vessel. The group is protesting the environmental risks posed by increased efforts to tap oil and natural gas reserves in the Arctic.

South African police officers lied, withheld documents and apparently doctored other papers during a government-appointed investigation of the police killings of 34 striking miners last year, a state commission said Thursday. The commission said it had to search computer hard drives of officers to discover documents about the August 2012 shootings at the Lonmin platinum mine near Marikana. The police version of events of the shootings “is in material respects not the truth,” said the commission after studying the newly obtained documents. The panel adjourned until Wednesday to study the new evidence.

The police opened fire on Thursday during clashes with supporters of the country’s largest Islamic party who were enforcing a general strike, leaving one man dead, local news media reported. The clash in the western district of Meherpur began when the opposition supporters attacked security officials, the United News of Bangladesh reported. As many as 15 people were wounded. The members of the party, Jamaat-e-Islami, were enforcing a strike to protest a recent Supreme Court ruling that a senior member of the party should be executed for crimes during the nation’s 1971 independence war against Pakistan. Party members said the verdict was politically motivated.

                            The documentary “Arise,” which celebrates women around the world leading movements in environmental protection, might reach a broader audience were its filmmaking more vibrant. A shame, because its message is worthy. Starhawk, from the San Francisco area, perhaps best captures the spirit of this gentle film when she speaks of women’s natural role in finding a “mosaic of solutions” to a planetary crisis.        


                            But saving the planet begins with saving a community, and “Arise” presents inspiring segments featuring diverse saviors and locales, like Judy Nyguthi Kimano in Kenya, Majora Carter in the South Bronx and Monica Chuji in Ecuador. I was most touched by Aida Shibli, a Palestinian Bedouin in Israel who feels strongly about guarding unattended land. “It’s very urgent for me,” Ms. Shibli says, tears barely at bay.        

                            “Arise” honors women as protectors, nurturers and activists, and words like “empower” and “sustainable” get a workout. There are images of women hunched studiously over electronics or linking hands to face the sun. Nature, of course, receives loving, reverent attention.        

                            The film, narrated by Daryl Hannah, uses thesis-driven poetry to link the segments; at these moments, there’s a sense of watching an overearnest public service message scored by the softest world-music sounds from Lilith Fair. Still, “Arise” always feels unified, a genuinely felt and executed womanist letter to the world.        

                            The segment with Ms. Carter in the Bronx especially provides hope, as it flashes back to the Victory Gardens efforts in the United States during World War II. We can do this, she tells schoolchildren. We can do this, she tells us.

President François Hollande of France declared Thursday that the war against Islamic extremists had been won in Mali, though he vowed to keep French forces in the country as long as the threat existed. Mr. Hollande spoke at the inauguration of Mali’s president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta. Islamic militant groups were able to seize control of northern Mali after a March 2012 coup. As they threatened to push farther south, France launched a military operation in January that was joined by other countries, forcing the jihadists to retreat. But some analysts cast doubt on Mr. Hollande’s claim of victory. There are “persistent reports that jihadists have either started filtering back into Mali or never left,” said Andrew Lebovich, an expert on the region.

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — When Rex Ryan was hired to coach the Jets in 2009, he insisted on running effectively, a philosophy that he captured in the catchphrase “ground and pound.” Even as the Jets develop Geno Smith, a rookie quarterback who understandably lacks polish, that is no longer Ryan’s mantra.        


“Do I expect us to run more than pass? Not really,” Ryan said after Thursday’s practice. “I’d like to be close to balanced. I think that’s where we’ve been the first couple of games. So I think that’s pretty good.”        
The Jets, who will host the Buffalo Bills on Sunday in a meeting of A.F.C. East teams with 1-1 records, have attempted 74 passes and 61 rushes. Smith dropped back 42 times in a 13-10 loss at the New England Patriots on Sept. 12 in a game that raised questions about how committed Marty Mornhinweg, the new offensive coordinator, would be to the run. The Jets backed off the ground game despite rushing 32 times for 129 yards; Smith threw three interceptions in the fourth quarter.        
Mornhinweg is well known for his pass-first approach — “This is the most I’ve ever run,” he said — and Ryan appears to welcome that.        
“The old football mentality about, Would I prefer to run the ball than throw it? Yeah, of course,” Ryan said. “But that being said, the way the game is played now, I also like to attack down the field.”        
Smith’s statistical line at New England, and his forgettable fourth quarter, raise questions about his ability to lead that kind of offense so soon. He completed only 15 of 35 passes for 214 yards. The Jets scored their lone touchdown on Bilal Powell’s 3-yard run with five minutes left in the third quarter. Powell carried 13 times for 48 yards. Chris Ivory, who was expected to play a major role after he was acquired from the New Orleans Saints during the off-season, had 12 carries for 52 yards. But Ivory carried only once after Powell’s score.        
Mornhinweg sounded as though he was willing to stay the course. “He is learning on the job just a little bit,” he said of Smith, “and that’s O.K.”        
Mornhinweg, the third offensive coordinator under Ryan, has far more experience than his predecessors, Brian Schottenheimer and Tony Sparano. Sparano had never held the position before and lasted only one season before he was dismissed and Mornhinweg was hired.        
Mornhinweg, who learned the West Coast offense under Bill Walsh, the former 49ers coach, built a strong résumé with San Francisco and then, for the last 10 years, with the Philadelphia Eagles. During Mornhinweg’s time with Philadelphia, the Eagles set single-season franchise records for completions (367 in 2012), total net yards (6,386 in 2011), completion percentage (62 in 2010), points (439 in 2010), average yards per rush (5.4 in 2010), third-down percentage (42.4 in 2007) and net passing yards (4,119 in 2006), among others.        
With that background, members of the Jets readily accept whatever he presents them. “I’ve always been a fan of running the ball early so you get into a rhythm,” right guard Willie Colon said. “But that’s not the way we’re built right now. We’re built to have Geno get the ball in the air.”        
Ryan believes that the greatest issue for the Jets involves execution, not approach. They had a number of dropped passes against the Patriots.        
“You’re leaving a lot of plays out there,” he said. “If we could have caught half of those balls we dropped, the outcome might have been a lot different. Clearly, you’re an N.F.L. receiver, you’re paid to catch the football, and we certainly need to do it.”        
EXTRA POINTS        
Coach REX RYAN opened his news conference by offering condolences to TOM COUGHLIN, his Giants counterpart. Coughlin’s younger brother, John, 63, died on Monday. “That’s as tough as it gets there,” Ryan said. John Coughlin is to be buried Tuesday in Waterloo, N.Y. ... Linebacker QUINTON COPLES, who sustained a hairline fracture of his right ankle Aug. 17, continues to progress as he practices on a limited basis. ... WILLIE COLON declined to say how much the N.F.L. fined him for his role in a fracas with the Patriots in the final minutes on Sept. 12, but he said he was appealing. “It was totally too much,” said Colon, who made contact with an official who was attempting to restore order.

WOODVILLE, Ala. — There are at least two types of Alabamian you don’t want to anger. One is a wild raccoon. The other is a person who rehabilitates wild raccoons.        


The state conservation agency that gives permits to volunteers who help injured and orphaned wildlife sent out a letter this month telling 72 groups and individuals to stop rehabilitating certain animals.        
Instead, the animals should be left to their fate or euthanized, either with a bullet or at the hand of a veterinarian. From the state’s perspective, the move would help prevent rabies and keep the food chain in balance.        
“There is no biological reason to rehabilitate these animals,” said Ray Metzler, assistant chief of wildlife for the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. “People need to learn to let nature take its course.”        
On the list were feral pigs, coyotes, bats and foxes — animals that do not often end up in the care of the volunteers. But at the top of the list were raccoons.        
Raccoons have never had it easy in Alabama, where a hunting license and a good coon dog are cultural currency in some parts of the state.        
Hunting associations here can legally keep up to 10 raccoons in a cage to train coon hounds. And since the 1950s, the state has offered permits for an event called “coon on the log.”        
The contests, which are rarer these days, are designed to test a coon hound’s mettle. A raccoon is tied to a log and floated into a lake. Owners then release their dogs and see which ones have the fortitude to knock the raccoon into the water.        
But rehabbers, as the people devoted to helping injured wildlife call themselves, love raccoons. They are as cuddly as puppies and easy to train when they are young but extraordinarily ornery once they hit adolescence, which is when rehabbers generally release them back into the wild.        
John Russ, a 65-year-old former Marine, just last week released two raccoons on his 144-acre sanctuary here.        
He and other rehabbers say the new restrictions stem from a conflict between members of one rehabilitation group and local wildlife officials. But they also believe an inherent anti-raccoon bias is at play. “These guys, they have some issue with raccoons,” Mr. Russ said. “They always have.”        
A hunter-first mentality, the rehabbers say, led to the state’s suggestion that raccoons, along with possums and skunks, which are also on the list, be euthanized or just left to fend for themselves.        
Baby raccoons are often orphaned because trees felled to clear land leave animals homeless or new ribbons of roadways bring more cars, which kill mothers.        
“A Ford truck is not nature taking its course,” said April Russ, Mr. Russ’s wife, who is also a rehabber.        
The state’s rehabbers have vowed to fight the ban, even if it brings trouble in a state where keeping a wild animal without a permit is illegal.        
“If somebody brings me a baby raccoon, I’m not going to turn it away,” Mr. Russ said. “It’s a death sentence.”        
Pleas for support have been sent to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and to Ellen DeGeneres and Bob Barker, both animal rights activists. Two petitions with at least 28,000 signatures are being prepared for Gov. Robert Bentley.        
Word is getting out to more rehabbers, a tight-knit group that has worked for decades to develop national guidelines. They share best practices, like what to feed a baby squirrel, how large a raccoon nesting box should be or how to make sure animals do not get too accustomed to humans while they are nursed back to health.        
“The whole world is going to see this horrific thing happening in Alabama,” said Kim Baker of Coast and Canyon Wildlife Rehabilitation in Malibu, Calif.        
Mr. Metzler insists there is nothing nefarious in the new policy, which he said was developed not out of a dislike for rehabbers or raccoons, but after a year of study and consultation with federal wildlife and rabies experts.        
He said the goal was to standardize policies that regulate both rehabbers and people who get paid to remove nuisance wildlife, like a snake in a garage or a raccoon in an attic.        
“We are not trying to put them out of business by any means,” Mr. Metzler said, adding that rehabbers can still save rabbits, deer and squirrels.        
“The point is we would like for people to leave wildlife alone,” he said. “That raccoon that’s accustomed to eating out of the dog bowl — it’s not going to survive in the wild.”

                            On Sept. 20, 1932, 11 workers sat on a beam 69 floors above Manhattan during the construction of Rockefeller Center. The photograph of this moment, one of the most famous images of New York, is called “Lunch Atop a Skyscraper” (even though a cigarette and a liquor bottle in the hands of these workmen are as noticeable as any sandwiches).        


                            Opening 81 years to the day after that photograph was taken is “Men at Lunch,” a documentary about the picture’s resonance as a symbol of Everymen and about the mystery of who those men really were.        

                            The film’s narration, by the Irish actress Fionnula Flanagan, is lovely; the details revealed of the photograph are fascinating; and the commentary by historians on how the photograph relates to life during the Depression and to the immigrant experience is illuminating.        

                            Yet the film feels meandering. Not only does it offer a jumble of ideas that aren’t followed through, but it’s also structured oddly. It culminates in the revelation that two of the workers in the picture were possibly from a small Irish village, which seems a detour from the American grandeur and casual bravery on which the film focuses. That the director, Sean O Cualain, is Irish, and that the film was financed partly by the Irish Film Board may explain this emphasis. But a montage of modern construction at the World Trade Center site near the end seems even more off the mark and without thematic connection to what preceded it.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday ordered the operator of Japan’s crippled nuclear power plant to scrap all six reactors at the site instead of just four scheduled for decommissioning and to concentrate on tackling pressing issues like leaks of radioactive water.        


But Mr. Abe insisted that radioactive water had been contained at the Fukushima Daiichi plant and said that he would fend off “rumors” regarding Fukushima’s safety. He instructed the plant’s operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, to decommission the No. 5 and No. 6 reactors, which survived the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that damaged the four other reactors. Mr. Abe said he stood by the reassurances about Tokyo’s safety that he gave to the International Olympic Committee this month before the city was awarded the right to host the 2020 Summer Olympic Games. But many Japanese believe that he is glossing over problems at the plant. Officials have acknowledged that radiation-contaminated groundwater has been seeping into the ocean since soon after meltdowns and explosions crippled the plant.

MOSCOW — The Russian government on Thursday approved across-the-board budget cuts over the next two years in the clearest sign yet that officials do not expect its economy, the world’s eighth-largest, to revive soon, and that the Kremlin is ready to try a new policy to spur growth.        


Making the move more unusual, the cuts come midway through a previously approved spending plan, and they reflect a shift in strategy away from reliance on consumer spending. In Russia, budgets are approved for three years in advance rather than year by year.        
The Finance Ministry now projects that revenue will be 3.5 percent lower in 2014 and 7 percent lower in 2015 than it predicted a year ago, when the government of President Vladimir V. Putin approved the three-year spending plan.        
Under the revised budget, military salaries will be frozen next year and the government will put less money into a pension fund for future retirees. It will use the money to meet current pension obligations instead.        
“The budget turned out really tough,” Dmitri A. Medvedev, the prime minister and a former president, said in comments carried by Russian news agencies on Thursday when he presented the new plan. “We had to work off the real situation in the economy in our country, and in the world.”        
The problems for Russia’s economy run deeper than its overwhelming dependence on oil and gas revenue, which account for more than half the federal budget.        
Wages that for years rose faster than labor productivity under economic policies that made Mr. Putin widely popular have now priced Russians out of the market for many goods and services globally.        
Russia’s economy is now growing more slowly than that of the United States. In the second quarter, the gross domestic product rose 1.2 percent in Russia, compared with 2.5 percent in the United States.        
Officials spent the summer debating how to reverse the slowing of economic growth here.        
In a speech in June, Mr. Putin suggested the Kremlin would try to prime the economy with government spending by dipping into about $171 billion in reserves in sovereign wealth funds to finance infrastructure projects like modernizing the trans-Siberian railway. Those spending plans were never carried out.        
Since then, the economic policy team has changed direction, economists say, and the new approach became clear with the release of the plan for cutting the three-year budget rather than running higher deficits.        
“They want to change the model of growth in Russia’s economy” away from dependence on consumer spending, Vladimir I. Tikhomirov, chief economist at the Otkritie brokerage house, said of the new policy. “The government and central bank have decided their top priority is to bring inflation down.”        
This shift, Mr. Tikhomirov said, reflects a deep-seated aversion by Mr. Putin to foreign borrowing of the type that made the Soviet Union beholden to Western banks in its later years. In light of the worsening slowdown here, further stimulus would require foreign borrowing.        
“It goes against normal economic policy” to cut spending in the face of an economic slowdown, Mr. Tikhomirov said.        
The new Russian policy instead retraces a growth strategy followed successfully in the late 1990s by Eastern European nations like Poland, which focused intensely on controlling inflation and borrowing costs for businesses. Though this brought a temporary slowdown, and even recession in some countries, business activity picked up as rates came down.        
The Russian government predicted several years of slow growth of about 3 percent, down from the 4.5 percent previously forecast.        
But inflation, the bane of post-Soviet Russia for many years, is projected to drop to 4.5 to 5.5 percent next year and below 5 percent in subsequent years, from around 6 percent this year.        
Without new growth produced by low interest rates in the later part of this decade, the government will struggle to meet demands for increased spending on pensions for the country’s aging population.        
In the short term, as inflation is brought under control and before growth picks up, Mr. Putin could find his political support eroding. Mr. Tikhomirov, the Otkritie economist, said the policy should start showing results in 2016 or so, before Mr. Putin is up for re-election in 2018.        
The government must submit the plan to the Parliament for approval by Oct. 1, though major changes are unlikely.

In the days before Aaron Alexis called the police in Newport, R.I., to complain that he was hearing voices sent by a “microwave machine,” employees at the Residence Inn in nearby Middletown were struggling to cope with his behavior.        


Daily logs kept by the hotel detailed how on successive nights, he knocked on doors to find the voices, woke up a person in one room and frightened another so badly she asked to move. Then came a call from his employer.        
“Brenda from The Experts Inc. called re: Mr. Alexis in 407,” a Residence Inn employee noted in a log dated Aug. 7 that was reviewed by The New York Times.        
“She explained that he is unstable and the company is bringing him home,” the entry continued. “She asked me to check the room (it was vacant), and check him out.”        
The call from the company, placed six weeks before Mr. Alexis, a former Navy reservist who the police say shot and killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard, suggests it had deep concerns about his state of mind and raises questions about why he continued to be sent to Navy bases in different states to work on their computer systems.        
Company officials have said that although they knew Mr. Alexis was complaining about voices, they believed he was saying that the hotel was too noisy. The company did not respond immediately to requests for comment on Thursday.        
It was one of numerous occasions in the weeks just before the shootings on Monday when Mr. Alexis’ increasingly bizarre behavior was noted by others, including hotel employees, guards at a Virginia airport and the police in Newport. Yet no one managed to head off the violence.        
Much remains unknown about Mr. Alexis’ life and what drove his actions, gaps that are likely to remain at least partly unfilled with his fatal shooting by police officers at the navy yard. But as details emerge, they suggest a man engaged in an intense internal struggle for control, a battle he ultimately lost. And like other mass killers before him — James E. Holmes in Colorado, Jared L. Loughner in Arizona, Seung-Hui Cho in Virginia — he left a trail of telltale signs that were minimized, misinterpreted or ignored.        
In many ways, Mr. Alexis, 34, seemed a jumble of contradictions. In Fort Worth, where he spent years in the Navy Reserve, he was described as friendly and sociable, drinking Heineken at bars with co-workers and chatting with customers at the Thai restaurant Happy Bowl, where he worked for a time.        
But he also held a piece of himself apart. “He would kind of close into himself,” said Melinda Downs, who knew him in Fort Worth and served as a motherly figure in his life. “He didn’t let a whole bunch of people in, because he’d been hurt. He handled himself carefully.”        
Like others, Ms. Downs recalled Mr. Alexis as “sweet” and often “playful.” But he also had outbursts of rage, some extreme; he told the police in  Seattle in 2004 that he shot out the tires of a construction worker’s car in an anger-fueled “blackout.” And co-workers at the Borough of Manhattan Community College in New York described him as a person who held on to grudges and did not tolerate fools gladly.        
Perhaps in an effort to keep his more violent emotions in check, Mr. Alexis practiced Theravada Buddhism, meditating for hours on the thick rugs of a temple in White Settlement, the suburb west of Fort Worth where he lived on and off for three years. He told one man affiliated with the temple that he aspired to be a monk, but he would stay up late at night playing violent video games in his room.        
Mr. Alexis, a computer specialist who led an itinerant life, traveling to naval installations around the country to service their systems, seemed aware of his emotional problems, telling friends he suffered from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. But it is not clear whether he ever sought mental health treatment. Visiting an emergency room at a veterans’ medical center in August, he said only that he was having trouble sleeping, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, a son and the onetime political heir of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, appeared in a tribal court on Thursday after the militia holding him defied an order from the state to deliver him to the capital, Tripoli. Mr. Qaddafi was captured nearly two years ago by the militia fighters. Asked by the judge whether he wanted to be tried in Tripoli, Mr. Qaddafi, who is also wanted by the International Criminal Court, said he preferred to remain in Zintan, 90 miles southwest of Tripoli. The trial in Zintan, unrelated to charges of crimes against humanity for which he is wanted in Tripoli and The Hague, involves a lesser charge of giving restricted information to an I.C.C. lawyer. Some Libyans say the Zintan fighters are doing more to protect him than to bring him to justice. In the power struggle between different militias since Colonel Qaddafi’s fall, the Zintan fighters have aligned themselves with tribes that once formed Colonel Qaddafi’s power base.

                            Early in Vlad Yudin’s new documentary, “Generation Iron,” Phil Heath is weighing whether he’s prepared to defend his Mr. Olympia title. “Can I get better than I just did?” he asks. It’s more of a challenge than a question, since the answer for him and the other bodybuilders profiled here — ahead of and during last year’s Mr. Olympia contest — is always an unequivocal yes. They may have 23-inch necks and who-knows-how-many-inch thighs, but they are indefatigable in their quest for the perfectly sculptured body.        


                            In interviews with Mr. Heath, Kai Greene and many others vying for the world’s highest professional bodybuilding title, Mr. Yudin tries to assemble a story of the state of the sport. There’s wealth and misfortune; debate about the roles of genes, science and hard work; and too-brief sections on corporate sponsorship and performance-enhancing drugs.        

                            “Generation Iron” is a sequel of sorts to “Pumping Iron” (1977) — which helped to kick-start the movie career of Arnold Schwarzenegger, a seven-time Mr. Olympia who makes a cameo here — but it lacks the mounting tension and lighthearted verve that made the other a success. For a documentary about extreme discipline, the filmmakers lack restraint: the movie, about 20 minutes too long, undercuts much of its own momentum. The narration, by Mickey Rourke, often repeats what has already been stated or is self-evident.        

                            Beneath the bloat, the main focus is the top contenders for the title: Mr. Heath, whose arrogance comes with some insecurity and who is seen living in luxury (sports cars and bubble baths) in Colorado, and Mr. Greene, a soft-spoken, contemplative painter from Brooklyn who had a troubled childhood and is now an inspiration. They can both taste victory.        

“Generation Iron” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Strong words from strong men.

WASHINGTON — Putting down a marker before his coming trip to the United Nations, Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that it was essential for the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution next week to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal.        


“Now the test comes,” Mr. Kerry said. “The United Nations Security Council must be prepared to act next week.”        
When the United States and Russia reached a framework agreement on Saturday to remove or destroy Syria’s chemicals weapons, Mr. Kerry emphasized that the next step was for the Council to pass a binding resolution to enforce the accord.        
Since then, however, important differences between Russia and the United States have emerged that call into question whether the agreement will ever be carried out.        
American, French and British officials have pushed for a strong Security Council resolution, which would provide a basis for imposing punitive measures if President Bashar al-Assad of Syria failed to comply. The United States and France have also said that the threat of force must be maintained to ensure that Mr. Assad follows through.        
But Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, has continued to assert that there is no proof the Assad government carried out a chemical attack near Damascus on Aug. 21, suggesting this week that additional investigation was needed before the Council could take any firm action. Russia has also rejected the potential use of force.        
In the statement by Mr. Kerry on Thursday, which he read at the State Department, he insisted that the case against the Assad government was ironclad and had been buttressed by the recent United Nations report on the attack.        
“Despite the efforts of some to suggest otherwise, thanks to this week’s long-awaited U.N. report, the facts in Syria only grew clearer and the case only grew more compelling,” Mr. Kerry said.        
The secretary of state is scheduled to go to New York on Sunday for a week of meetings in conjunction with the convening of the United Nations General Assembly.        
“We really don’t have time today to pretend that anyone can have their own set of facts approaching the issue of chemical weapons in Syria,” he said.        
Earlier on Thursday, Mr. Kerry met with Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China, seeking support for a firm resolution in the Security Council.        
In public remarks before a working lunch, Mr. Kerry noted that the United States and China had differed sharply over how strongly to respond to the chemical weapons attack. But he appealed to China to play a “positive, constructive, important role” in the Council’s deliberations.        
Mr. Wang said that China, which holds a Security Council veto, supported the framework agreement and believed that the United Nations should as well. But he did not provide any clues as to how firmly the resolution should be worded. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. also met with Mr. Wang.        
As the United States and Russia sought to influence the Security Council resolution, a senior member of the Assad government said that a cease-fire should be imposed if peace talks were held to end the conflict.        
“Neither the armed opposition nor the regime is capable of defeating the other side,” Qadri Jamil, the Syrian deputy prime minister, said in an interview with The Guardian. “This zero balance of forces will not change for a while.”        
Mr. Kerry plans to meet next week with Mr. Lavrov and Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations envoy on the Syria crisis, to discuss planning for a possible peace conference.        
No date for a conference has been set, and Russia and the United States are at odds over who should attend. Russia, for example, has insisted that Iran should participate. The United States has opposed including Iran and said the “London 11,” a group of European and Arab nations that support the Syrian opposition, should attend.        
Even as he called for a peace conference, however, Mr. Jamil objected to proposals by the United States and its allies as to how it should be organized.        
The United States has insisted that a Syrian opposition coalition led by Ahmad al-Jarba play a major role in negotiating a transfer of power to a transitional government from which Mr. Assad would be excluded.        
“We’re fed up with this monopolistic view,” Mr. Jamil said.

BERLIN — A FEW weeks ago, Germany’s left-leaning Social Democratic Party threw a lavish campaign event for more than 200,000 people next to the Brandenburg Gate in the middle of Berlin. There were bratwurst, balloons and songs, but the party never quite took off.        


Perhaps that’s because in this Sunday’s national election, the Social Democratic Party, Germany’s oldest and proudest, is likely to endure yet another crushing defeat, just as it did in 2009, when it was voted out of government with a meager 23 percent of the vote.        
When you ask leading members of the Social Democrats to explain why on earth they are losing so much ground at a time when global capitalism has been getting such bad press, they have an easy answer. It is Chancellor Angela Merkel’s fault. The right-of-center chancellor, they feel, constantly outflanks them on the left: minimum wages, gender quotas in the workplace, same-sex marriage — they name it, she hastens to adopt it.        
She even ordered the shutdown of the country’s nuclear power plants, a signature goal of the Social Democrats’ ally the Green Party, after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan.        
But blaming Ms. Merkel is too easy. There is a longer story to tell.        
The Social Democratic Party, which is celebrating its 150th birthday this year, was once the world’s largest and most influential workers’ party, the global standard-bearer for the modern European welfare state. By the end of the 20th century, though, it was often more about nostalgia for past accomplishments than the present and future of its constituents.        
But by the early part of the last decade the Social Democrats, under the leadership of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, were once again ahead of the game. The party saw itself as a force for modernization; it romanticized the future, not the past. The welfare state had to be adjusted, if it was to survive at all — and had to fit an aging country with more migrants, fewer natural resources and fewer children.        
Our current “Wirtschaftswunder,” or “business miracle” of economic success amid a Europe-wide recession, is largely a result of painful labor reforms put in place by Mr. Schröder and the Social Democrats beginning in 2003.        
The reforms paid off for the country as a whole, but they were hard on the poor. Unions lambasted Mr. Schröder, and thousands marched in the streets against him. The reforms cost his party a third of its members, many of whom fled to a new party, the Left, which draws much of its strength from those disappointed with post-Communist life in the former East Germany.        
That membership exodus cost the Social Democrats control of the government in 2005, after which they were forced into a so-called grand coalition with Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats. In response, the Social Democrats distanced themselves from Mr. Schröder and his reforms, apologizing profusely for their greatest achievement.        
So while Ms. Merkel may co-opt some left-wing issues as her own, on the biggest issue of all, it is the Social Democrats who have ceded the political payoff of Mr. Schröder’s reforms — low unemployment and a stable social security system — to the right.        
The Christian Democrats would never dream of picking a fight with the unions, or facing demonstrators in the streets. Ms. Merkel recently admitted as much: “We would not be where we are today without the courageous steps taken by my predecessor, Chancellor Schröder.”        
All is not lost for the Social Democrats, however. For months Peer Steinbrück, the sharp-tongued, witty candidate of the party, stumbled from one gaffe to the next. He came across as arrogant, technocratic and uncaring, and as a centrist uncomfortable with taking up the left’s banner. At the lowest point of his campaign, he found himself reduced to tears during a public appearance with his wife after she expressed her support for him.        
But he has begun to turn things around. In a recent TV debate, Mr. Steinbrück managed to come across as decisive and politically brave by questioning Ms. Merkel’s one weakness: her unwillingness to take a stand, to run a political risk. Suddenly, Mr. Steinbrück’s technocratic arrogance looks like a strength.        
With Election Day approaching, Social Democrats have long given up on the idea of winning outright. What they dread now is doing just well enough to be forced again into a coalition with the invincible Ms. Merkel. Yet that is increasingly the most likely outcome. It’s also what an overwhelming majority of Germans want.        
Many Social Democrats fear being stifled as the junior partners to a powerful chancellor. But there is no shame in being part of a grand coalition. If the party can own up to its success, it can use its coalition role to build on that record.        
It might not lead to victory right away, but one day, it could. Contrary to what many seem to think, Angela Merkel will not be around forever.

STANFORD, Calif. — THE specter of violence caused by mental illness keeps raising its head. The Newtown, Conn., school killer may have suffered from the tormenting voices characteristic of schizophrenia; it’s possible that he killed his mother after she was spooked by his strange behavior and tried to institutionalize him. We now know that Aaron Alexis, who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, heard voices; many observers assume that he, too, struggled with schizophrenia.        


To be clear: a vast majority of people with schizophrenia — a disease we popularly associate with violence — never commit violent acts. They are far more likely to be the victims of violence than perpetrators of it. But research shows us that the risk of violence from people with schizophrenia is real — significantly greater than it is in the broader population — and that the risk increases sharply when people have disturbing hallucinations and use street drugs. We also know that many people with schizophrenia hear voices only they can hear. Those voices feel real, spoken by an external, commanding authority. They are often mean and violent.        
An unsettling question is whether the violent commands from these voices reflect our culture as much as they result from the disease process of the illness. In the past few years I have been working with some colleagues at the Schizophrenia Research Foundation in Chennai, India, to compare the voice-hearing experience of people with schizophrenia in the United States and India.        
The two groups of patients have much in common. Neither particularly likes hearing voices. Both report hearing mean and sometimes violent commands. But in our sample of 20 comparable cases from each country, the voices heard by patients in Chennai are considerably less violent than those heard by patients in San Mateo, Calif.        
Describing his own voices, an American matter-of-factly explained, “Usually it’s like torturing people to take their eyes out with a fork, or cut off someone’s head and drink the blood, that kind of stuff.” Other Americans spoke of “war,” as in, “They want to take me to war with them,” or their “suicide voice” asking, “Why don’t you end your life?”        
In Chennai, the commanding voices often instructed people to do domestic chores — to cook, clean, eat, bathe, to “go to the kitchen, prepare food.” To be sure, some Chennai patients reported disgusting commands — in one case, a woman heard the god Hanuman insist that she drink out of a toilet bowl. But in Chennai, the horrible voices people reported seemed more focused on sex. Another woman said: “Male voice, very vulgar words, and raw. I would cry.”        
These observations suggest that local culture may shape the way people with schizophrenia pay attention to the complex auditory phenomena generated by the disorder and so shift what the voices say and how they say it. Indeed, that is the premise of a new patient-driven movement, more active in Europe than in the United States, which argues that if you treat unsettling voices with dignity and respect, you can change them.        
The Hearing Voices movement encourages people who hear distressing voices to identify them, to learn about them, and then to negotiate with them. It is an approach that flies in the face of much clinical practice in the United States, where psychiatrists tend to assume that treating such voices as meaningful encourages those who hear them to give them more authority and to follow their commands.        
Yet while there is no judgment from the scientific jury at this point, there is evidence that at least some people find that when they use the Hearing Voices approach, their voices diminish, become kinder and sometimes disappear altogether — independent of any use of drugs.        
This evidence is strengthened by a recent study in London that taught people with schizophrenia to create a computer-animated avatar for their voices and to converse with it. Patients chose a face for a digitally produced voice similar to the one they were hearing. They then practiced speaking to the avatar — they were encouraged to challenge it — and their therapist responded, using the avatar’s voice, in such a way that the avatar’s voice shifted from persecuting to supporting them.        
All of the 16 patients who received a six-week trial of that therapy found that their hallucinations became less frequent, less intense and less disturbing. Most remarkably, three patients stopped hearing hallucinated voices altogether, even three months after the trial. One of those three patients had heard voices incessantly for the prior 16 years.        
The more we know about the auditory hallucinations of schizophrenia, the more complex voice-hearing seems and the more heterogeneous the voice-hearing population becomes. Not everyone will benefit from the new approaches. Still, they offer hope for those struggling with a grim disease.        
Meanwhile, it is a sobering thought that the greater violence in the voices of Americans with schizophrenia may have something to do with those of us without schizophrenia. I suspect that the root of the differences may be related to the greater sense of assault that people who hear voices feel in a social world where minds are so private and (for the most part) spirits do not speak.        
We Americans live in a society in which, when people feel threatened, they think about guns. The same cultural patterns that make it difficult to get gun violence under control may also be responsible for making these terrible auditory commands that much harsher.

Editorial,"










Early this year, Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, made headlines by telling his fellow Republicans that they needed to stop being the “stupid party.” Unfortunately, Mr. Jindal failed to offer any constructive suggestions about how they might do that. And, in the months that followed, he himself proceeded to say and do a number of things that were, shall we say, not especially smart.        


Nonetheless, Republicans did follow his advice. In recent months, the G.O.P. seems to have transitioned from being the stupid party to being the crazy party.        
I know, I’m being shrill. But as it grows increasingly hard to see how, in the face of Republican hysteria over health reform, we can avoid a government shutdown — and maybe the even more frightening prospect of a debt default — the time for euphemism is past.        
It helps, I think, to understand just how unprecedented today’s political climate really is.        
Divided government in itself isn’t unusual and is, in fact, more common than not. Since World War II, there have been 35 Congresses, and in only 13 of those cases did the president’s party fully control the legislature.        
Nonetheless, the United States government continued to function. Most of the time divided government led to compromise; sometimes to stalemate. Nobody even considered the possibility that a party might try to achieve its agenda, not through the constitutional process, but through blackmail — by threatening to bring the federal government, and maybe the whole economy, to its knees unless its demands were met.        
True, there was the government shutdown of 1995. But this was widely recognized after the fact as both an outrage and a mistake. And that confrontation came just after a sweeping Republican victory in the midterm elections, allowing the G.O.P. to make the case that it had a popular mandate to challenge what it imagined to be a crippled, lame-duck president.        
Today, by contrast, Republicans are coming off an election in which they failed to retake the presidency despite a weak economy, failed to retake the Senate even though far more Democratic than Republican seats were at risk, and held the House only through a combination of gerrymandering and the vagaries of districting. Democrats actually won the popular ballot for the House by 1.4 million votes. This is not a party that, by any conceivable standard of legitimacy, has the right to make extreme demands on the president.        
Yet, at the moment, it seems highly likely that the Republican Party will refuse to fund the government, forcing a shutdown at the beginning of next month, unless President Obama dismantles the health reform that is the signature achievement of his presidency. Republican leaders realize that this is a bad idea, but, until recently, their notion of preaching moderation was to urge party radicals not to hold America hostage over the federal budget so they could wait a few weeks and hold it hostage over the debt ceiling instead. Now they’ve given up even on that delaying tactic. The latest news is that John Boehner, the speaker of the House, has abandoned his efforts to craft a face-saving climbdown on the budget, which means that we’re all set for shutdown, possibly followed by debt crisis.        
How did we get here?        
Some pundits insist, even now, that this is somehow Mr. Obama’s fault. Why can’t he sit down with Mr. Boehner the way Ronald Reagan used to sit down with Tip O’Neill? But O’Neill didn’t lead a party whose base demanded that he shut down the government unless Reagan revoked his tax cuts, and O’Neill didn’t face a caucus prepared to depose him as speaker at the first hint of compromise.        
No, this story is all about the G.O.P. First came the southern strategy, in which the Republican elite cynically exploited racial backlash to promote economic goals, mainly low taxes for rich people and deregulation. Over time, this gradually morphed into what we might call the crazy strategy, in which the elite turned to exploiting the paranoia that has always been a factor in American politics — Hillary killed Vince Foster! Obama was born in Kenya! Death panels! — to promote the same goals.        
But now we’re in a third stage, where the elite has lost control of the Frankenstein-like monster it created.        
So now we get to witness the hilarious spectacle of Karl Rove in The Wall Street Journal, pleading with Republicans to recognize the reality that Obamacare can’t be defunded. Why hilarious? Because Mr. Rove and his colleagues have spent decades trying to ensure that the Republican base lives in an alternate reality defined by Rush Limbaugh and Fox News. Can we say “hoist with their own petard”?        
Of course, the coming confrontations are likely to damage America as a whole, not just the Republican brand. But, you know, this political moment of truth was going to happen sooner or later. We might as well have it now.

Sports,"










For decades, soccer officials in the United States simply wanted some fans in their stadiums. Now they have them, and some of those fans have brought an unexpected problem: a vulgar chant, in the vein of more notoriously rabid soccer fans in other countries.        


Hardly clever, it is only three words — an insult directed at the opposing goalkeeper — but enough to give M.L.S. officials fits as they hear it spill over into live television broadcasts. The chant’s simplicity is what makes it appealing or appalling, depending on your perspective.        
It has been heard this season at Major League Soccer games in Seattle; Sandy, Utah; Harrison, N.J.; Kansas City, Kan.; and Columbus, Ohio, among other places. It has been shouted by thousands of fans at men’s national team games, too.        
“Sport is spontaneous, it’s passionate, and I don’t think any of us would want to remove that from the game,” said Evan Dabby, senior director of supporter relations at M.L.S. “That’s what makes it beautiful. That’s what makes it enticing.”        
But there are boundaries around that beauty, the league has decided. Dabby this season has overseen a new, focused initiative to get clubs to eradicate the chant, which, according to him, “is neither passionate nor spontaneous.”        
The sentiment behind the effort is not new. Commissioner Don Garber spoke out publicly against the chant last year. Before that, teams like the Portland Timbers and the New England Revolution, among others, engaged in something like fan diplomacy, behavioral psychology or motivational tactics — or perhaps all three. Their efforts have revealed how a fledgling sports league tries to nurture and shape an emergent fan base.        
It appears to be succeeding, partially. The league said the chant was no longer done in organized fashion at any M.L.S. stadiums, though it remains a delicate situation.        
“What anyone can witness is progress,” Dabby said.        
It is deployed in one specific game situation: when the opposing team’s goalkeeper prepares to restart the game on a goal kick, there is a crescendo of percussive noise and swelling voices. When the player then puts his foot through the ball, the fans yell out the phrase in unison.        
The three-word chant, known as the Y.S.A. chant, is a more vulgar expression of “You suck, jerk.” It has deep but unclear roots, dating back at least a decade. Its form and usage are similar to ones used in South America, Central America and Europe, suggesting that early M.L.S. fans — who borrow heavily at first from international fan cultures — adopted the structure and added their own choice words.        
“It was a way to be antagonistic, in a tongue-in-cheek way,” said Dave Hoyt, a former president of Portland’s fan group, Timbers Army. “It gets people’s attention.”        
Timbers fans used the chant from about 2007 to 2009 (when the club played in a minor league), Hoyt said, before deciding as a group that it was overused. Hoyt said it was not about censorship. “We still have plenty of chants that have blue language, or whatever you want to call it,” he said.        
Its obscenity is the chief concern for its harshest critics. Others, like Hoyt, simply find it played out. And some, particularly those exposed to overseas soccer stadiums, may wonder what the fuss is about.        
Anti-Semitic chants last season at a Premier League stadium in England caused a scandal. Racist chants directed at black players continue to be a scourge for many European leagues. Set against these examples, the American chanting may seem harmless.        
But Jerome de Bontin, a former president of the French club Monaco, who was hired last year as the general manager of the Red Bulls, said residual European hooligan culture was nothing to aspire to. He said he appreciated that American fans seemed interested in games rather than creating a ruckus and was disappointed when he heard the chant for the first time.         
“I thought it was absurd, that it really didn’t belong and that, if we didn’t take some action, it would probably get worse because, as more fans come to the games, they would develop this false idea that it’s accepted, that it’s encouraged,” de Bontin said.

Underwater creatures and medieval knights might seem unlikely themes for an exhibition of contemporary art, but the Glyndor Gallery at Wave Hill is filled with works inspired by fish, suits of armor and intersections of the two. “Tandem Pursuits: Armor & Ichthyology” presents pieces in a range of media, from intricate watercolors of fanciful fish, to aluminum sculptures suggestive of codpieces, to a video documenting a dress that inflates like a blowfish when its wearer feels threatened.        


“Tandem Pursuits” is the second in a series of programs and exhibitions at Wave Hill, a former Bronx estate that is now a 28-acre public garden, paying tribute to former residents. The show’s title refers to the professions and passions of Bashford Dean, who lived in Wave Hill House, one of the homes on the property, from 1909 until his death in 1928. An ichthyologist specializing in placoderms, or armored fish, Dean was also an enthusiastic collector of armor. He was concurrently the first curator of fish at the American Museum of Natural History and the founding curator of the arms and armor department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. (“Bashford Dean and the Creation of the Arms and Armor Department” is on view at the Metropolitan Museum through the fall of 2014 to commemorate the department’s centennial.)        
Visitors to the Georgian Revival-style Glyndor Gallery, another former home at Wave Hill, will encounter an intriguing assortment by 16 artists ranging in age from their 20s to their 80s. “I like to think these are works that Bashford Dean himself might have chosen,” said Jennifer McGregor, Wave Hill’s director of arts and senior curator.        
He probably would have been taken by Holly Sumner’s two large-scale illustrations of radiolaria, tiny ocean zooplankton with spiky exoskeletons. And he might have been surprised to learn that she pursued dual interests akin to his.        
At the time Ms. Sumner started drawing radiolaria, she was also exploring the armor galleries at the Metropolitan Museum. She was particularly enamored with the samurai suits and couldn’t help noticing their similarities to her subject matter. She called the figures in her drawings “my samurai radiolaria.”        
Other works in the exhibition also evoke Dean’s parallel careers. WonJung Choi’s “Fearless,” a site-specific installation in a fireplace, is composed of nine hanging fish crafted from metal, including chain mail. Three prints by Marina Zurkow, from her series “Heraldic Crests for Invasive Species,” whimsically reimagine traditional coats of arms. In her designs, fish and other creatures broadcast messages of environmental rather than military conquest. In Carol Hepper’s abstract painting “Percussion,” the canvas is stitched-together skins of sturgeons, ancient fish with thorny protrusions and bony plates instead of scales. Completed in 2000, it is part of a series of paintings on the skins of various fish. Ms. Hepper described sturgeon as the most resilient medium she worked with, adding, “Their abrasive surface wore my paintbrushes down quickly.”        
Frank Gehry, the celebrated architect, once described the fish as “a perfect form.” In the mid-1980s, he created a series of “Fish Lamps,” commissioned by the Formica Corporation. The one displayed at Wave Hill curves gently, its scales made from shards of white plastic laminate outlined in light when the lamp is switched on.        
Fish also served as muse for Ben Snead, who painted a portrait of Dean for “Tandem Pursuits” collaged from catfish, the focus of Dean’s doctoral thesis. Mr. Snead painted the fish from images in field guides, then photocopied them, cut them up and arranged them as a mock-up for the final piece. “I divided each fish into three sections: head, tail and body,” he said, explaining that he assigned specific parts to different areas of Dean’s face. “It’s my personal classification system, based on aesthetics rather than science.”        
In the painting, Dean appears virile and imposing, with heavy eyebrows and a jutting jaw. A different interpretation was conceived by Camilla Huey, a professional couturier (who has dressed the likes of Aretha Franklin and Katy Perry) and an artist who combines costumes and artifacts to build sculptural personifications of historical figures. For “Tandem Pursuits,” her subjects were Dean and his wife, Mary Alice Dyckman Dean.        
Mrs. Dean’s portrait is a lacy, corseted garment, with Dean invoked by a fishbone emerging from the frilly neckline. For her “Bashford Dean Portrait” in a cabinet across the room, Ms. Huey constructed a jacket inspired by Japanese karuta kotes, padded coats covered with chain mail and lacquered leather that samurais wore beneath their armor. Referring to Dean’s ichthyologic achievements, the jacket is framed by a satin representation of oversize embryonic pectoral bones with fins that reach to the floor.        
Wandering through the exhibition, gallerygoers are bound to find unexpected associations between fish and armor: the layers of articulated metal plates like scales, patterned and protective, hugging the body in motion. “It’s interesting to see the teasing out between the two,” Ms. McGregor said. “It’s not a natural connection, but once you delve into it, it starts to make sense.”        



 
“Tandem Pursuits: Armor & Ichthyology” runs through Dec. 1 at the Glyndor Gallery at Wave Hill, 675 West 252nd Street (main entrance at West 249th Street and Independence Avenue), the Bronx. Information: (718) 549-3200 or wavehill.org.

Business,"










Dow Jones confirmed on Thursday evening that the company would part ways with Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, the co-editors of the very popular All Things Digital news site, at the end of the year when their contracts expire.        


Mr. Mossberg has been the highly influential author of Personal Technology columns with The Wall Street Journal for two decades. He and Ms. Swisher collaborated as co-executive editors on All Things Digital, a separate Web site that covered technology and start-up news and also held conferences.        
Colleen Schwartz, a spokeswoman for Dow Jones, said the decision to part had been mutual but who would retain the rights to the All Things Digital brand and the archived content had not been decided.        
“Right now we have not finalized plans with respect to the brand. The details still being worked out,” she said. Neither Ms. Swisher nor Mr. Mossberg could be immediately reached for comment. Nevertheless, on her Twitter feed, Ms. Swisher made it clear that Dow Jones owned the brand and would keep it. “They have ALWAYS owned it, even though Walt and I built it,” she wrote.        
The question of whether Ms. Swisher and Mr. Mossberg will be able to compete with the brand they built is of no small significance.        
Technology coverage and conferences stemming from brands associated with technology coverage are a growing business in a largely bleak journalism landscape and one that many people are looking to exploit. AOL, the media company, is expanding conferences through its TechCrunch brand, for example.        
Gerard Baker, editor in chief of Dow Jones and managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, said in a statement that The Journal was increasing its bet on technology coverage even without Ms. Swisher and Mr. Mossberg, its most prominent stars.        
“We plan to embark on a major global expansion of our technology coverage, which will include adding 20 reviewers, bloggers, visual journalists, editors and reporters covering digital. As part of this global push, we will also be expanding our conference franchise to include an international technology conference and building a new digital home for our first-class technology news and product reviews on The Wall Street Journal Digital Network,"" he said.        
Fortune, which was the first to report the news, noted earlier that Ms. Swisher and Mr. Mossberg had hired the investment bank Code Advisors to find outside investors to support a move to become independent.        
A person with knowledge of the deal said the two had backing, but no partners had been named at this point.

                            Resembling a Francophile fantasy yet based on actual events, “Haute Cuisine” recounts Danièle Mazet-Delpeuch’s tenure as private chef to President François Mitterrand. Plucked from the Périgord region of France, Ms. Delpeuch — here renamed Hortense Laborie — yields to no one in cooking the grandmotherly comfort food desired by her country’s patrician leader. As flatly directed by Christian Vincent, “Haute Cuisine” is a reserved, très simple tale that raises the occasional smile and tummy rumble but keeps hiccuping because of the drawn-out parallel story about her subsequent tour of duty.        


                            Installed in a private kitchen at the Élysée Palace, Hortense (Catherine Frot) is polite but strict on matters of culinary principle, an old hand at populist fare though not a popularizer. (Her male sous-chef dismisses “the phony populism of jelly beans.”) This Gallic drama hinges, to an extent remarkable even for the material, on the correct and timely preparation of traditional recipes.        

                            Truffles, stuffed cabbage, Rochefort jonchée and St. Honoré cake are essentially this static film’s plot points. These dishes strengthen Hortense’s bond with the president, daintily played by Jean d’Ormesson, the novelist and dean of the Académie Française. Mr. Vincent, who wrote the screenplay with  Étienne Comar, throws in some perfunctory pressure from the palace’s bean counters, weight watchers and disdainful main kitchen.        

                            Regular interruptions come from dull flash-forwards to Hortense’s next job, at an outpost in Antarctica. Her home-style cooking may melt Mr. Mitterrand’s heart, but the filmmaking in “Haute Cuisine” lacks her skill.        

“Haute Cuisine” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for strong language.

Florida’s  destructive efforts to sabotage health care reform has drawn a much-needed response from the Obama administration. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, has been visiting the state to encourage private groups to help residents understand what insurance policies and federal subsidies will be available to them when the enrollment period opens Oct. 1.        


Florida has been shameless in attempting to destroy what top officials call “Obamacare,” with tactics that will deprive its own poor and middle-income citizens of the benefits of the national reform law. Although almost 25 percent of Florida’s population, or 3.8 million people, are uninsured, the state declined to expand its Medicaid program to cover more low-income residents despite extremely generous federal matching grants to pay for such expansions. And it refused to set up its own health care exchange, leaving that job to the federal government. A few months ago, the Republican-dominated Legislature and Republican governor stripped the state insurance commissioner’s office of its broad powers to hold down premium increases to affordable levels.        
In the latest outrage, the state Department of Health on Sept. 9 ordered some 60 county health agencies, whose clinics treat large numbers of poor and uninsured people, to bar from their premises counselors, or “navigators,” seeking to inform people how to enroll in insurance plans and get subsidies under the health reform law. The department claimed this edict was consistent with its general policy of preventing outsiders from using county property for their own purposes and protecting individuals’ privacy. But the main goal was to keep counselors away from people apt to enroll in the health exchange.        
Ms. Sebelius has awarded almost $8 million in grants to Florida organizations to hire and train outreach workers and another $8 million to community health centers for the same purpose. Businesses like CVS Caremark, Florida Blue and insurance brokers are also mounting campaigns to inform Florida residents about what the federal law provides. With the state government so adamantly obstructive, the success of health care reform in Florida will depend heavily on such private efforts.

Some rare good news has offset the usual grim predictions about the planet’s dwindling natural resources. Kenya, one of Africa’s most important countries, has uncovered a potentially huge new water source. Now comes the challenge of managing it fairly and transparently.        


The discovery, announced last week by Kenya and the United Nations, involves five aquifers in impoverished Turkana County that could mean a more secure future for the country as a whole. Of Kenya’s 41 million people, an estimated 17 million lack access to safe drinking water and 28 million are without adequate sanitation. The new underground sources, estimated to hold at least 66 trillion gallons, could be used for drinking, irrigating crops and watering livestock.        
The project shows what can be done when responsible authorities work together. Identifying the aquifers was a joint effort of the Kenyan government and Unesco, with financial support from Japan, a major donor of international development assistance. Advanced satellite equipment and expertise from Radar Technologies International helped provide technical breakthroughs. Radar Technologies, a natural resources exploration concern, has confirmed two of the five aquifers through drilling, but further exploration at the other three sites is needed before experts can determine more precisely how much water exists and what it will take to extract it.        
Kenya’s task is to figure out, with United Nations help, how to protect these supplies and tap them in ways that ensure they last for generations. Management needs to be fair and open, with clear limits on how much water can be extracted, how often and by whom. This may not be easy in a country with a history of corruption, and where the president and deputy president are facing trial by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity stemming from the 2007 presidential election.        
Water scarcity is a huge problem globally, fueling competition among states, regions and tribes and sometimes leading to bloodshed. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has estimated that by 2030 nearly half the world’s population will live in areas with severe water stress. Kenya’s remarkable good fortune is a ray of hope in this otherwise gloomy picture.

In what can be seen only as an act of supreme indifference, House Republicans passed a bill on Thursday that would drastically cut federal food stamps and throw 3.8 million Americans out of the program in 2014.        


The vote came two weeks after the Agriculture Department reported that 17.6 million households did not have enough to eat at some point in 2012 because they lacked the resources to put food on the table. It came two days after the Census Bureau reported that 15 percent of Americans, or 46.5 million people, live in poverty.        
These numbers were basically unchanged from 2011, but in a growing economy steady rates of hunger and poverty amount, in effect, to backsliding. Cutting food stamps would accelerate the slide. Food stamps kept four million people out of poverty last year and kept millions more from falling deeper into poverty. Under the House Republican bill, many of these people would be impoverished.        
The struggling middle class is also faring poorly. Though the unemployment rate dropped to a low of 7.8 percent last year from a high of 9.1 percent in 2011, median household income was virtually unchanged, at $51,017. In a healthy economy, income would rise when unemployment falls. But in today’s weak economy, much of the decline in the jobless rate is not due to new hiring, but to a shrinking work force — the very definition of a feeble labor market in which employed people work for years without raises and unemployed job seekers routinely end up in new jobs that pay less than their previous ones.        
Even so, congressional Republicans have shown no inclination to end the automatic budget cuts that, if left in place, will lead to an estimated loss of 900,000 jobs in the coming year, keeping poverty high and incomes stagnant. In addition, there seems to be little Republican appetite for renewing federal unemployment benefits — a lifeline for millions of unemployed Americans — when they expire at the end of 2013.        
It is nothing new that poor people are stuck and those in the middle class are struggling. The poverty rate, though steady last year, has worsened or failed to improve in 11 of the last 12 years. The latest numbers would have been worse but for “doubling up.” There are currently 10.1 million adults age 25 to 34 who are not in school and who live with parents or others who are not spouses of cohabitating partners. If they were on their own, 43 percent of them would fall below the poverty line, which last year was $11,945 for someone under age 65.        
Similarly, while median household income held steady last year, it was still lower by 8.3 percent, or $4,600, (measured in 2012 dollars) than in 2007, before the recession. And the longer the historical perspective, the more dire the situation. From 2000 to 2012, median income for working-age households headed by someone under age 65 (again in 2012 dollars) fell almost $7,500, from nearly $65,000 to just under $57,500, a decline of 11.6 percent.        
Against that backdrop, there is no justification for savaging the safety net and decimating the budget.

New Jersey has some of the strongest pay-to-play laws in the country, aimed at regulating the awarding of contracts and other favors in exchange for campaign contributions. That has made little difference this year for some New Jersey players who have found a backdoor way to support Gov. Chris Christie’s campaign for re-election.        


Since 2005, a government contractor who donates more than a set (and very limited) amount to a state campaign — the race for governor, for example — could lose state business as a result. The law even has an anti-circumvention clause that is supposed to keep a contractor from hiding donations by sending money to an outside group that then bounces the money back to a New Jersey politician.        
As Nicholas Confessore wrote in The New York Times this week, some New Jersey donors appear to be working around those laws rather easily. At least 15 contractors doing business with the state have given more than $500,000 to the national Republican Governors Association. The governors group, in turn, has poured $1.7 million into Mr. Christie’s re-election effort.        
The association has insisted it does not earmark donations, even for Mr. Christie, who will be the group’s chairman next year. A spokesman at Mr. Christie’s campaign says that “everybody is in strict compliance” with the law.        
Maybe so. But the bounce from New Jersey contractors to the governors association to New Jersey deserves investigating. The Citizens Campaign in New Jersey, which led efforts to pass the state’s pay-to-play laws, is concerned. As Heather Taylor, a spokeswoman for the group, has suggested, at the very least the state treasurer should “look into for potential circumvention” by state contractors making these donations. In addition, the state’s election law enforcement commission should delve into details of what appears to be an attempt to evade the pay-to-play statute.        
Mr. Christie is leagues ahead of his Democratic opponent, State Senator Barbara Buono, and these dicey funds might not make much difference in a lopsided race. Still, New Jersey’s attempts to clean up a culture of donations linked to state business deserve more than a shrug from the politicians and the state officials charged with overseeing their campaigns.

Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column for the Tribune. 


Texas Republicans don’t have the problem Texas Democrats have: there are plenty of conservatives clamoring for the top spots on the ballot. But in a year when their liberal opponents are accusing them of waging a war on women, they could end up with very few women at the top of their ticket.        
It is easy to see that as a talking point, especially if the Democratic ticket is led by a woman, but it is difficult to tell what it might mean on Election Day in November 2014.        
Many political consultants will say that female candidates outdo male candidates when all other things are equal. Others, like Bryan Eppstein of Fort Worth, say the answer is more complex.        
“Gender matters less, and ideology —  not party, but ideology —  matters more,” he said. “It’s not a general advantage or disadvantage.”        
The contention that Meg Whitman, a Republican, might have an advantage over Jerry Brown, a Democrat, in the 2010 race for California governor proved to be wrong. Kay Bailey Hutchison lost to Rick Perry in the Republican primary for Texas governor that same year.        
Mr. Eppstein, a Republican, attributes the wins and the losses to other factors. Democrats, revved up by State Senator Wendy Davis’s sudden celebrity during and after a June debate on a contentious abortion bill, see a potential advantage in topping their slatewith a woman against a Republican ticket where women are scarce.        
In some ways, the political campaigns on the Republican side are well under way. Mr. Perry said in July that he would not run for another term, and Attorney General Greg Abbott quickly confirmed his plans to run for that job. That opened the gates, and the days between then and now have been filled with political news. Candidates are raising money, appearing at forums, hugging voters and kissing babies.        
In some ways, the beginnings are still under way. Candidates can’t file for office until Nov. 9, and they have until a month after that to make their intentions officially known.        
Democrats are still putting together their announcements. Ms. Davis of Fort Worth said this week that she would announce her plans Oct. 3; it would surprise many Democrats to hear anything other than the start of her run for governor. Fuzzy as that might seem, it is the clearest peek into the Democratic playbook.        
Others, like State Senator Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio, are considering statewide runs in 2014, but none have said anything official yet. Some announcements have been in the negative: Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio, after a political cotillion at the Democratic National Convention last year, seemed all dressed up for a statewide race. But he’s not running, telling reporters and others that he still has things to do as mayor and that he doesn’t think this is the right year for him.        
On the Republican side, there are women in both of the top races at this speculative point of the game,but neither is expected to slow the juggernauts John Cornyn and Mr. Abbott. Mr. Cornyn, the state’s senior United States senator, does not have any well-known opponents yet in his race for re-election. The most serious threat to Mr. Abbott in the race for governor is the underfinanced Tom Pauken, a former state Republican Party chairman. If Linda Vega and Miriam Martinez are bona fide contenders in those two races, they have yet to reveal themselves.        
The races for lieutenant governor and attorney general are emptyon the Democratic side and stag parties on the Republican side. Debra Medina is interested in the race for comptroller if she can pull together the resources to be competitive. The only other nonjudicial statewide race with female Republican candidates is for the Texas Railroad Commission, and no front-runner has emerged from a field that so far includes seven Republicans.        
Because the Democratic candidates have not lined up, it’s impossible to know right now whether they will have a similar male imbalance. Any advantage attributable to gender might be too small anyhow. The best performance by a statewide Democrat since 1994 was 49 percent, and most results fell far short of that.        
The election will be defined by the issues the top candidates choose to talk about, and gender could easily change the tenor of that debate.

TEHRAN — Iran’s leaders, seizing on perceived flexibility in a private letter from President Obama, have decided to gamble on forging a swift agreement over their nuclear program with the goal of ending crippling sanctions, a prominent adviser to the Iranian leadership said Thursday.        


The adviser, who participated in top-level discussions of the country’s diplomatic strategy, said that Mr. Obama’s letter, delivered to Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, about three weeks ago, promised relief from sanctions if Tehran demonstrated a willingness to “cooperate with the international community, keep your commitments and remove ambiguities.” The text of the letter has not been made public, but the adviser described its contents in an interview in his office on Thursday.        
A senior American official did not dispute the general outlines of the letter as described by the longtime adviser and Iranian political expert, Amir Mohebbian. But the official said Mr. Obama had not promised Iran quick relief from sanctions, and had steered clear of any detailed proposal.        
Mr. Mohebbian and other officials and analysts said that Iran was focused on getting quick relief from financial sanctions because they have cut it off from the international banking system, and that in exchange it might be willing to curb its nuclear enrichment program. Some in the leadership are also worried that if nuclear talks do not yield quick results, Iran’s hard-line clerics and military men — currently sidelined — could attack Mr. Rouhani as a sellout and clip his political wings.        
The Iranian leadership was encouraged by what was described as Mr. Obama’s offer to conduct face-to-face talks, which they prefer to the more bureaucratic and lengthy negotiating process with a group of five major world powers, Mr. Mohebbian said.        
The one-and-a-half-page letter, which the Iranian president answered with a letter of similar length, has kindled hopes that the international charm offensive Iran began after Mr. Rouhani’s election in June may produce a genuine diplomatic breakthrough. But the differing interpretations of Mr. Obama’s letter in Tehran and Washington are a reminder of the political hurdles and the legacy of mistrust that both sides will have to overcome in negotiating a deal.        
The American official said Mr. Obama had congratulated Mr. Rouhani on his election, and characterized the vote as an opportunity for change. But on sanctions, the official said, the Iranians were inferring relief from the president’s more general pledge to resolve issues and move forward. And while Mr. Obama is open to direct talks, the official said, they will not necessarily be leader to leader.        
The Iranian reaction to the letter provides critical insight into a decisive and unexpected shift in strategy by the moderate new president as Iran struggles to restore vitality to its economy and undo years of hostile relations with most of the world under the former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.        
The overtures to the United States are part of a flurry of steps altering the trajectory of the Iranian state, including domestic liberalizations and returning the politically powerful military to the barracks — for now. Those actions, along with the changed diplomatic tone, have convinced some experts that the changes are more than cosmetic.        
Mr. Rouhani will present Iran’s new face to world next week with an address to the United Nations General Assembly, an evening speech to the Council on Foreign Relations and the Asia Society, and a television interviews with Charlie Rose and CNN.        
In an opinion essay published in The Washington Post on Friday, Mr. Rouhani said world leaders should “seize the opportunity presented by Iran’s recent election.”        
“I urge them to make the most of the mandate for prudent engagement that my people have given me and to respond genuinely to my government’s efforts to engage in constructive dialogue,” he wrote.        
Skeptics were quick to point out that Mr. Obama has reached out to Iran before. Having promised as a candidate to extend an olive branch to old enemies, he sent a letter early in his first term to the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, proposing a new diplomatic chapter. In his reply, Ayatollah Khamenei did not take Mr. Obama up on his offer.

Weekend,"







                            Don’t expect to see the rise of Wing Chun martial-arts legend Ip Man recounted in Herman Yau’s “Ip Man: The Final Fight.” (That would be Mr. Yau’s 2010 film, “The Legend Is Born: Ip Man.”) Instead, this straightforward social drama, written by Erica Li, catches up with Ip Man in his twilight years as a teacher in postwar Hong Kong. Mr. Yau and Ms. Li’s Ip Man is a far cry from the hero popularly portrayed by Donnie Yen in two earlier hit movies, or by Tony Leung as the smoldering fighter in Wong Kar-wai’s film “The Grandmaster.” 


                            “The Final Fight” is a film in which labor strife and colonialist crackdowns are a source of conflict as much as crime. Hong Kong’s tumult buffets Ip Man (Anthony Wong), and intrigue arises out of his loyal but conservative circle of pupils, who include a union organizer and a cop facing corruption. Mr. Wong’s poise sets his upstanding, middle-aged character apart, beloved as a teacher but out of step. Romance (with his wife and later a cute-as-a-button singer) only turns tragic.        

                            Ip Man does fight baddies, when he must, in a few efficient sequences. And elsewhere, Mr. Yau favors an interminably drifting camera that feels affected and ill-suited to his endeavor. But seriously, if not always elegantly, the film portrays the great Ip Man as someone trying to survive, which is to say just as often a victim as a victor.        

“Ip Man: The Final Fight” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for martial arts violence and the perils of opium.

Our quirky, discerning picks for the most interesting things to do around the state this week.        


HOUSTON 
See the Light 
The visual artist James Turrell splits his time living in Maryland, New York and Arizona, where he has been working on his Roden Crater project in an extinctvolcano since the 1970s,but it is legitimate for Texas to claim him as its own. He has two “skyspaces,” chambers with an aperture in the ceiling open to the sky, in Dallas and two in Houston, with another,“The Color Inside,” scheduled to open at 6:25 a.m. on Oct. 19, on the rooftop of the University of Texas Student Activity Center, in Austin.        
The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, also claims to have more Turrell works than any other American museum, and it will highlight seven “immersive light environments” through this weekend, part of the exhibition “The Light Inside.” Seeing one of these colorful light installations might feel hallucinatory and disorienting — a holding cell after being abducted by aliens. “He’s an orchestrator of experience,” the painter Chuck Close told The New York Times Magazine in a June profile of Mr. Turrell, “not a creator of cheap effects.”        
“The Light Inside” is one of three major Turrell exhibitions happening simultaneously — the two others are in Los Angeles and New York — making it an invitation to engage in part of the grandest art statement this year.        
The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Sept. 20-22, mfah.org 
DALLAS 
A Muted Soundtrack 
Renewed beauty has blossomed from the 2011 Bastrop wildfires. Last summer, artists staged “Art From the Ashes,” an exhibition of works derived from the ruins. This summer, Bastrop’s Lost Pines area serves as the backdrop of “Prince Avalanche,” the newest work from the Austin filmmaker David Gordon Green.        
The movie’s soundtrack was scored by the Austin instrumental rock band Explosions in the Sky and its collaborator, David Wingo. Most people associate Explosions in the Sky with its blitzkrieg of electric guitars and hammering drums, as heard in its score for the Texas high school football drama “Friday Night Lights.” So the band may surprise some at the Breakaway Festival, its first live performance in Texas since the movie’s release, with its evolved sound, full of muted, tender moments outfitted with piano and woodwinds. But perhaps this dramatic change of pace will inspire fans to revisit the new music in its proper context: with the movie, which is still in theaters.        
FC Dallas Stadium, Sept. 21, 11 a.m., breakawayfestival.com 
SAN ANTONIO 
On the Road 
Fredericksburg Road in northwest San Antonio was built in the 1840s as a portal for the military to access West Texas, and then, in the mid-1900s, the suburbs and strip malls proliferated, transforming the road into a main thoroughfare.        
But much of that changed with the construction of Interstate 10. The exhibit “Traveling on Fredericksburg Road: 120 Years in 12 Miles” is a case study conducted by students from the University of Texas at San Antonio on urban expansion from 1890 to 2010, within the context of this road. In addition to photographs, maps, and interviews with residents and business owners — including Linda DeWese of the Tip Top Cafe — there will be the opportunity for time travel, via a short film that is sped up so viewers visually experience 120 years and 12 miles on Fredericksburg Road in less than eight minutes.        
Institute of Texan Cultures, Sept. 19-Dec. 15, texancultures.com 
ABILENE 
Reading Ahead 
The 13th annual West Texas Book Festival in Abilene has, in a sense, scooped the 18th annual Texas Book Festival in Austin, the state’s premier book event: four of the six authors advertised to appear at the West Texas Book Festival are also participating in the Texas Book Festival a month later.        
That means bookworms can hear from former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison on her book, “Unflinching Courage: Pioneering Women Who Shaped Texas,” and Jeff Guinn, the award-winning Fort Worth author who has written about the shootout at the O.K. Corral and Bonnie and Clyde, talk about his new biography of Charles Manson, well in advance of the literati who will pour into Austin the last weekend of October.        
Abilene Public Library and Abilene Civic Center, Sept. 24-28, abilenetx.com 
AUSTIN 
Face Lift 
While Austin is known for its live music and food, it lags behind other Texas cities in its arts scene, a fact that the new Contemporary Austin — which recently received a $9 million donation to create a 12-acre lakeside sculpture garden — hopes to start changing with new exhibitions that are having their debut this weekend.        
The Contemporary Austin, Sept. 20-22, thecontemporaryaustin.org 
HOUSTON 
High Strung 
Stradivarius violins, which the Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari started making in the late 17th century, are extremely rare and expensive, and are said to produce unparalleled sound, which people can hear when the Hungarian violinist Edvin Marton plays one as part of the Brilliant Lecture Series.

To the Editor: 


“Wall St. Exploits Ethanol Credits, and Prices Spike” (front page, Sept. 15) appropriately scrutinizes developing energy markets. The integrity of these markets is vital to the success of renewable fuels policies.        
But we must remember that the Environmental Protection Agency just administers the tracking system for ethanol credits (Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs); it doesn’t create the credits. RINs are created when people use biofuels. So the transactions of interest are not between the oil industry and the E.P.A., but between different players in the oil supply chain.        
Astute readers will have noticed that most of the program’s critics cited in the article had ties to the oil industry. Fundamentally the Renewable Fuel Standard is about using less oil and shifting to cleaner alternatives. Those goals remain.        
Yes, the E.P.A. and other regulators should improve transparency in the RIN program. But we should not allow the oil industry to stand in the way of our transition to cleaner fuels.

To the Editor: 


It has been nearly three decades since I arranged the first secret official negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, and dashed as my hopes may have been by the end of Oslo, not once have I come to Ian S. Lustick’s conclusion that the two-state solution is “an idea whose time is now past” (“Two-State Illusion,” Sunday Review, Sept. 15).        
The Israeli people once elected a prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, who was willing to pursue a peace agreement that recognized the authentic aspirations of both peoples, and who went a long way toward achieving it before he was assassinated. There is every reason to believe that Israelis would elect such a person again, if the right leader came along — and there is every reason to believe that such a leader could complete the work initiated by Mr. Rabin.        
On the Palestinian side, there is already a leader who has shown a willingness to pursue a peace agreement. Mahmoud Abbas is well aware that the Palestinian people need to focus their national aspirations not on the negation of Israeli goals, but on creating the preparatory structures for a Palestinian state. And he has talked openly about the Palestinians’ self-destructive approach to the conflict. I sincerely believe that Mr. Abbas remains ready to pursue peace, if he can find an Israeli leader willing to engage in permanent-status negotiations.        
Peacemaking requires courageous leadership. And when such leadership is in power, a peace agreement — and the two-state solution on which it can only be based — is anything but an illusion.

Re “The Duty to Protect, Still Urgent” (Op-Ed, Sept. 14):        
Prof. Michael Ignatieff’s argument fails to persuade.        
First, it doesn’t apply to the Syria case, since President Obama’s purpose was to punish President Bashar al-Assad for an attack that had already happened, rather than “protect” victims of continuing chemical warfare.        
Second, the protect doctrine would have us abandon the rule of law. Whatever its shortcomings, the United Nations is an expression of the international community, the ultimate source of international law. To accord to the United States or to any nation the right to determine when to use force strikes me as a dangerous proposition. We need to strengthen the United Nations, not weaken it further.        
Third, Professor Ignatieff’s argument rests on the notion of American exceptionalism, a belief that we Americans know better than anyone else how and when to attack unilaterally. Who has given the United States the right to police the world?        
Lastly, Syria is horrible, but so are many other global spots, past and present. How can a “responsibility to protect” principle be implemented on a consistent basis?

The writer is co-founder and former director general of the International Development Law Organization in Rome. 
To the Editor: 
Michael Ignatieff worries that his version of the responsibility to protect — known as R2P — is facing a crisis of “legitimacy.” His notion of R2P asserts a right to violate United Nations Charter rules prohibiting resort to force for certain humanitarian purposes.        
In 2005, United Nations members rejected this assertion. The members reached the decision after the hard lessons of the 2003 Iraq invasion, an unlawful use of force that Mr. Ignatieff initially supported. United Nations members renewed the consensus that the measure of international legitimacy is international legality.        
R2P has, unfortunately, distracted academics from thinking creatively about how to enforce international norms like the chemical weapons ban without resort to unlawful war. Popular pressure has forced our leaders to look for those solutions in the Syria crisis and, one hopes, beyond.

Re “Overpopulation Is Not the Problem” (Op-Ed, Sept. 14):        
Erle C. Ellis recounts his transition from a narrow, distorted biological determinism regarding the challenges facing the human population to a narrow, distorted social-scientific optimism that “the only limits to creating a planet that future generations will be proud of are our imaginations and our social systems.”        
Both extreme positions ignore the more complex reality that human choices interact with natural constraints.        
The biology, chemistry and physics of the earth are imperfectly understood. It is not possible to predict precisely what some human choices may lead to, or whether some future environmental changes may be beyond human control. It is clear, however, that every additional billion people constrain further the choices available for life on earth, human and otherwise.        
Continued rapid human population growth makes it harder and more costly to solve all our problems. The institutional, technological and behavioral innovations that have a chance of leading to the rosy future Mr. Ellis envisions will happen only with substantial effort and investment, and will be easier with slower or no population growth.

To the Editor: 
Erle C. Ellis’s thesis seems overly theoretical. Let’s examine the reality of life on earth today:        
More than a billion people live below the global poverty rate of $1.25 a day; one out of three people on earth lacks modern sanitation; nearly 800 million face water scarcity; and 18,000 children under 5 die every day from preventable causes.        
We’re altering the climate of the planet by pumping billions of tons of fossil fuel emissions into the air each year. The real world is already overcrowded, as thousands of plant and animal species face the threat of extinction.        
Technology can certainly help meet these challenges. Instead of inventing ways to cram ever more people onto the planet, let’s help provide universal access to the technological miracle of modern contraception.        
JOHN SEAGER
President, Population Connection
Washington, Sept. 14, 2013        
To the Editor: 
Erle C. Ellis asserts that “there is no environmental reason for people to go hungry now or in the future.”  That must be comforting to the planet’s billion-plus hungry people.        
Mr. Ellis concludes that population growth is the mother of invention, always stimulating us to coax more food from the land: “Our planet’s human-carrying capacity emerges from the capabilities of our social systems and our technologies more than from any environmental limits.”                
This fantasy that we can keep growing, even though Earth doesn’t, recalls the economist Julian L. Simon, who also believed that human ingenuity ensured that resources would never run out.         
In 1994 he wrote, “We have in our hands now ... the technology to feed, clothe and supply energy to an ever-growing population for the next seven billion years.”               
Paul R. Ehrlich, the author of “The Population Bomb,” retorted that at current population growth rates that was unlikely: within 6,000 years, the mass of humans would equal the mass of the universe.  This century, we’ll reach nearly 11 billion. Averaging only half a child less per family, we’d be just 6.2 billion. Which sounds more realistic to you?

The writer is the author of the forthcoming book “Countdown: Our Last, Best Hope for a Future on Earth?”  
To the Editor: 
Erle C. Ellis’s hopeful confidence in human ingenuity does not obviate the fact that humanity gets irreplaceable services from nature, and that we are indisputably undermining nature’s ability to provide us with those essential services.        
Contrary to the impression left by Mr. Ellis’s article, nature is the ultimate source of all economic value. No commerce is possible without clean air, clean water, fertile topsoil, a chemically stable atmosphere, raw materials for food, energy and medicine, and the natural processing of wastes by the millions of species inhabiting our soil, water and air.        
It is the availability of these at-risk ecological services that makes possible the technical innovations that Mr. Ellis is banking on.

In 2009, Debra Medina began an underdog bid for governor of Texas, delivering one fiery speech after another to any Republican club or Tea Party group that would let her make the case for a platform focusing on state sovereignty, gun rights and eliminating the property tax. For nearly a year, until her appearance in a televised debate drew national attention and energized her fund-raising, the campaign sustained itself on a shoestring budget.        


Four years after emerging as a Tea Party darling in Texas, Ms. Medina is eyeing the open race to succeed Comptroller Susan Combs. But as she weighs another run, she knows that donations from grass-roots supporters can take a candidate only so far in Texas.        
“I’m hesitant to go out to these meetings and say, ‘I’m running,’ because I’m not going to run underfunded,” said Ms. Medina, who predicts that grass-roots supporters could provide 30 percent of what she needs for a campaign.        
“I think the other 70 percent is going to have to come from high-wealth individuals who fund campaigns in Texas,” Ms. Medina said. “There, it’s not coming.”        
Her comments underscore the huge role that wealthy donors play in Texas elections, where there are no limits on how much an individual can donate to a candidate for a state office. With the majority of voters spread among several large media markets, running a statewide campaign can be prohibitively expensive.        
“I think that Debra Medina is probably right, that it’s very difficult to run a grass-roots-funded statewide campaign for that reason,” said Andrew Wheat, research director for Austin-based Texans for Public Justice, which studies campaign financing. More than half of most statewide officials’ campaign accounts stem from contributions of $10,000 or more, he said.        
Ms. Medina’s campaign for governor came on the heels of the birth of the Tea Party movement. Though Gov. Rick Perry, who ultimately won re-election, quickly embraced many of the movement’s views of limited government, some voters believed it conflicted with his record, and they turned to Ms. Medina in the Republican primary, according to Mark P. Jones, chairman of political science at Rice University in Houston.        
“There’s a certain level of support she has out there,” Mr. Jones said. “There are people who remember her and identify with that wing of the party.” (Rice University is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.) In July, Ms. Medina reported having $55,000 in her campaign account. Two Republicans already running for comptroller, State Senator Glenn Hegar of Katy and State Representative Harvey Hilderbran of Kerrville, reported war chests of $1.8 million and $1 million.        
The comptroller serves as the state’s chief financial officer, overseeing tax collections and estimating the amount of revenue the Legislature can employ to create its next two-year budget. Texas comptrollers have also used the position to encourage public debate on various economic issues. Ms. Medina said the office was uniquely suited to her interest in influencing the state’s approach to financing government over the long term.        
“My driver is not being in elected office; my driver is changing policy,” Ms. Medina said. “Actually, driving policy where our so-called conservative leaders have told us they’re taking it.”        
That mix of bluntness and ideological purity was evident to voters during Ms. Medina’s unsuccessful bid for governor. Whereas many Republican candidates have nothing but praise for Texas’ concealed carry permit system, Ms. Medina derided it as government interference. She continues to say that Texas lawmakers defy the state’s conservative image by spending liberally and instituting regulations that unnecessarily distort markets.        
“I think that Debra felt like a lot of conservatives who backed Perry weren’t real conservatives,” said Luke Macias, a Republican consultant whose clients include several Texas House members with strong ties to the Tea Party. “I haven’t seen her build coalitions since then.”        
Her campaign for governor found fast momentum after a January 2010 televised debate in which she was widely viewed as defending her views and questioning her opponents better than Mr. Perry or Kay Bailey Hutchison, then a United States senator. Ms. Medina quickly drew more than $400,000 in donations from thousands of new supporters. It was more than she had raised in the previous year but a far cry from the millions being spent by Mr. Perry and Ms. Hutchison at the time.        
Yet Ms. Medina’s standing in the race continued rising until Feb. 11, when the conservative radio host Glenn Beck asked her whether she agreed with those who believe the government was involved in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.        
“I think some very good questions have been raised in that regard,” Ms. Medina told him, adding that she did not have a position on the issue. Her opponents immediately vilified her, and her campaign never recovered.        
Ms. Medina said she never meant to suggest that she believed the government was involved in the attacks, only that people had the right to question their government.        
After finishing third in the primary with 19 percent of the vote, Ms. Medina started We Texans, a nonprofit that advocates many of the same positions of her campaign, including replacing the property tax in Texas with a tax on consumption. The group’s work has helped Ms. Medina maintain a presence in the Liberty movement, a Libertarian branch of conservatism that overlaps somewhat with the Tea Party and is closely identified with Ron Paul, the former Texas congressman and two-time Republican presidential candidate whom Ms. Medina counts as a mentor and ally.        
No matter how much she raises, Ms. Medina is almost certain to be outspent throughout the Republican primary, Mr. Jones said.        
“Absent to having a credible statewide media campaign, it’s difficult to see her beating either Hegar or Hilderbran because they’re going to get a ton of money dumped in their lap if they’re running against Debra Medina,” Mr. Jones said. “The last thing the Republican establishment wants is Debra Medina as state comptroller.”

In Texas, where oil lubricates the economy the same way it does pickup trucks, energy consumption is no exception to the state’s everything-is-bigger reputation. The nation’s leading energy producer also uses more energy by far than any other state.        


As the state’s population keeps surging, demand is expected to grow, prompting leaders to think about how it will meet its long-term needs.        
Now, a diverse coalition, which includes renewable energy advocates, city officials, bankers and others, is racing to institute a plan to increase energy and water efficiency upgrades that supporters say could help Texas improve its conservation record and become a model for other states.        
“We’re such a big energy user,” said Kip Averitt, a former Republican state senator who is part of the effort. “That means our opportunity to be efficient is huge as well.”        
Supporters acknowledge the challenge of avoiding pitfalls that have tripped up similar efforts elsewhere.        
The approach, known as Property Assessed Clean Energy, or PACE, addresses the biggest barrier to efficiency investments: initial costs that can take years to recoup. A law allowing cities and counties to set up programs passed this year with overwhelming support in the Legislature.        
PACE allows the owners of commercial and industrial property to use a property tax lien to finance energy efficiency upgrades like solar panels and water recycling systems. PACE programs bill an owner through the lien and forward payments to a private lender. Under a smooth-running program, property owners pay less than what they save on their energy bills. If a property is sold, the new owner would inherit the debt — a rule meant to further reduce the risks of investment.        
Tony Bennett, the president of the Texas Association of Manufacturers, said that after scrutinizing PACE, his group was backing the plan. “We don’t like subsidies,” he said. “We don’t like picking winners and losers.” But PACE is different, he said, and it would spur investments that could help his group’s 450 businesses cut costs.        
Thirty other states allow similar financing plans, though most apply only to energy, unlike in Texas. Most of the states have stumbled, largely because of the objections of mortgage regulators, who feared that PACE liens would take precedence over mortgages if a homeowner defaulted. And in California, one of a few states that has had investment under PACE, observers say, a patchwork of rules across cities has discouraged investors from financing projects statewide.        
“We have some baggage to overcome,” said Charlene Heydinger, a lawyer leading the Texas coalition, called Keeping PACE in Texas. But she and her colleagues say they benefit from their state’s late entry to the movement and ability to learn from others’ stumbles.        
The coalition is devising what it calls “PACE in a Box,” a model it hopes many of Texas’ 254 counties and more than 1,200 cities will adopt, encouraging consistency in a state that values local power. It plans to unveil the program by the end of the year, and it is raising money to travel and make pitches to local governments.        
Many PACE supporters would prefer the program to apply to home upgrades as well. But by focusing solely on commercial and industrial properties, advocates have garnered support from bankers.        
In a state where industry guzzles more than half of the energy used and makes up close to 20 percent of all the industrial consumption in the United States, the narrowed focus could have an impact on energy demand.        
“The scale here is so much bigger, said Doug Lewin, the executive director of the South-central Partnership for Energy Efficiency as a Resource, based in Austin. “I think Texas could be a leader in energy efficiency.”

BAGHDAD — As a former interpreter for the American military, and as a gay man, Hassan says he is a focus of frequent discrimination by his fellow Iraqis.        


That is why Hassan, who asked to be identified only by his middle name because he fears for his safety, does not see any future in his own country, where he is shunned for his sexuality and viewed as a traitor.        
His last and best hope, he said, is a visa to the United States.        
But that chance is now fading for Hassan and many others who worked for the American military. As they face increased violence here, they find themselves trapped in a glacially paced visa program set up for Iraqis that will expire at the end of the month unless new legislation is enacted to save it.        
“The United States is my last hope for salvation,” said Hassan, whose case is being assisted by a New York-based organization, the Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project at the Urban Justice Center. “It’s a place where I can be who I am, where people will accept me for who I am.”        
That many Iraqis who worked with the American military are still in the pipeline for special visas to emigrate to the United States — the State Department will not say how many, but activists estimate it is in the low thousands — remains an unresolved legacy of the American war.        
It is also a reflection of the perilous state of the country nearly two years after the departure of American troops: the rising violence, which includes the remobilization of militias that once targeted Iraqis who helped the United States, has raised new fears and led more former interpreters to apply for the program, just as it is set to expire.        
Becca Heller, the director of the refugee assistance group, said she was hopeful that legislation would eventually be enacted to preserve the program. But she is worried that if the program goes dark for even a few months, current applicants may have to start the onerous process again under a new law.        
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who is backing new legislation to save the program, said: “We have a responsibility as Americans to provide assistance to those people who have been helpful, who risked their lives to help our country. And I think we need to make sure we fulfill that obligation.”        
A group of representatives and senators in Washington, including some lawmakers who are themselves Iraq veterans, is hurrying to save the program, which was enacted in 2007 and has been hampered all along by long delays because of security checks.        
The original legislation earmarked 25,000 visas over five years, and over that time roughly 8,000 have been issued. So far this year, the State Department has issued just 454 special immigrant visas for Iraqis. Lawmakers say there is little actual opposition in Congress, but the issue has been caught in a legislative logjam, and has been given little attention by many politicians who would prefer to forget about the Iraq war.        
As the deadline approaches, options are running out. Attempts at passing immigration and defense bills that included provisions for the visa program failed, and now lawmakers hope to include it in a continuing resolution that would keep the government running from October through the end of December.        
Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois who served two tours in Iraq before entering politics, is among the lawmakers trying to save the visa program.        
As a pilot, Mr. Kinzinger did not work much with Iraqi interpreters. But he was moved to action after reading a book by Dakota Meyer, a Marine who earned the Medal of Honor for bravery in Afghanistan. Mr. Meyer spoke out about his interpreter’s difficulty in securing a visa to the United States, despite his having been with Mr. Meyer at the battle for which he was awarded the medal.        
“Look,” Mr. Kinzinger said in an interview, “we’re a big country. We’re a country with plenty of room. And when you have people willing to fight alongside of us, and put them and their family’s lives in danger, then we ought to repay them.”        
About a year ago Hassan gave his passport to the American Embassy in Baghdad, and believed it would be returned within a few months with a visa. His last communication with the State Department was an automated reply to an e-mail telling him that his case was in “administrative processing” and warning him that the program may expire at the end of September.        
He is living with a sister in northern Iraq, where it is safer, but is still without his passport.        
“I can’t get out of Iraq at all,” he said.        
Former interpreters not only worry about their safety, but say their employment prospects in Iraq are bleak because of discrimination against anyone who aided the American war effort. Some see a visa as a ticket for a better life for their children.        
“I’m trying to give my son the opportunity to be an astronaut, if he wanted to be,” said Yousif al-Timimi, another former interpreter caught in the visa backlog. “If he’s in Iraq, these options are not available. If he goes to the states and fails to be something important, it is his fault. My job as a father is to make these options available to him.”        
On a recent afternoon, another Iraqi man in a similar predicament, and who also asked his name not be published because of safety concerns, unzipped a black briefcase and pulled out a laptop and a thick file folder containing his case documents.        
“Where should we begin?” he said.        
He displayed letters of recommendation from military officers who were his superiors. He waved another letter, this one documenting the threats he said he had received over the years from a Shiite militia. He has several relatives in the United States, and his mother lived there in the 1980s and 1990s before her death in 1999. As proof he showed a copy of his mother’s California driver’s license. He has been waiting three years for a visa, with little explanation for the delay.        
Then he fired up his laptop, and started a photo slide show. Image after image showed him smiling, alongside American soldiers. One showed his daughter’s birthday party, held on an American base.        
“Tell me if I’m one of the family or not,” he said.

                            Adversity makes for unlikely allies in “Zaytoun,” an odd-couple road movie set in 1982 as Israel is preparing to invade Lebanon.        


                            As the film opens in a Beirut already roiling in civil war, the director, Eran Riklis, injects chaotic street scenes with vigorous energy. When Fahed (Abdallah El Akal), 12, a recently orphaned Palestinian refugee, chances upon a captured Israeli pilot, (Stephen Dorff), he suppresses his hostility to offer the enemy a deal: take him safely to his family’s long-abandoned home in Israel, and he will help the pilot escape.        

                            Once en route to the southern border, the characters, obliged to fulfill the requirements of a formulaic — and child-friendly — peace allegory, enjoy an adventure that’s more kooky than life-threatening. Progressing by cab, donkey, stolen jeep and shank’s mare, the pair dodge buried land mines and inept checkpoint guards with identical ease, their growing affection spurred by soft-serve peril and cemented by contrivance.        

                            Trapped in a script (by Nader Rizq) that groans with sentiment and symbolism, Mr. Dorff looks a little lost, unconnected to the barren beauty of the Israeli locations that the Danish cinematographer, Dan Laustsen, takes pains to honor. Mr. El Akal, for his part, is burdened mainly by the traumatized olive tree (the title is Arabic for “olive”) that his character must lug across country for an emblematic planting in the family garden. His mission is touching and his director well-meaning, but in grabbing for the heart this one-size-fits-all fable sadly ignores the mind.

When the Mets moved into Citi Field five years ago, they were also, as it turned out, settling into fourth place in the National League East and making themselves comfortable. If their season ended Friday, they would finish in that very undistinguished spot for the fifth straight season. It would be a franchise record, dubious as it might seem, for never in their uphill history have they ended up staying in the same place for so long.        


Even in the 1960s, when the Mets made a name for themselves as one of the worst teams in baseball history, they finished 10th, and last, only in their first four years of existence. In the fifth year, 1966, they finished next to last, in ninth.        
In baseball’s current division format, fourth is the new ninth, a home for teams that are usually overmatched and not going anywhere in particular. That certainly describes the current Mets, who have now been in fourth place long enough to buy a new recliner, hang up some pictures and get to know the neighbors (hello, Miami Marlins).        
Things could still change this season, although the odds are that they will not. After Thursday afternoon’s loss to the San Francisco Giants, the Mets were 68-84, three games behind the Phillies, whom they will play in Philadelphia this weekend. If they can somehow sweep the Phillies, then an escape route from fourth place would actually present itself in the final week of games.        
That, in turn, might liven up what has been another dreary September for Mets fans, with key players injured or traded, with youngsters up from the minors hoping to impress but maybe not quite ready. For the Mets, September has become the month that will never end, and when it actually does, they are — what do you know? — in fourth place again.        
They landed there in 2009 with a 70-92 record that followed on the heels of two straight September collapses that cost them spots in the postseason. In the three seasons that followed, the Mets’ records got a little bit better and then a little worse — 79-83, then 77-85 and then 74-88 — but fourth place continued to beckon, as it does again.        
And finishing next to last in 2013 would conform with the general direction of their history. In their 51 previous seasons, the Mets have finished first just five times and dead last — whether it was 5th, 6th, 7th or 10th place — 13 times. Next to last? Thirteen times as well, and counting.        
In other words, the Mets have finished in the basement or right next to it for more than half of their existence.        
So how much would it matter if the Mets could at least sneak into third place by the end of September? Would it make a season filled with the usual assortment of disappointments any brighter?        
Manager Terry Collins said beating out the Phillies would be a “great accomplishment with all the things we’ve went through.” His players did not disagree, although it was clear that the constant fourth-place finishes was not the foremost thing on their minds.        
And what about the fans? On a recent, chilly weeknight, Pat O’Donnell, 66, and his wife, Eleanor, sat in the upper deck of Citi Field, leaning on a railing, eyeing each pitch, as they watched the Mets lose. He wore his Ron Darling jersey. She wore a Daniel Murphy T-shirt. What about it? they were asked. Would third place feel liberating? Did finishing fourth again bother them?        
“They actually had a chance earlier in the season to finish second!” O’Donnell exclaimed. He then listed off all that went wrong this year and added, “Ah, but it was not to be.”        
He said he hoped the Mets caught the Phillies and finished third, if only because “the Phillies have the worst fans in the world when they come here.”        
“They get in fights,” he said. “They’re very obnoxious. They talk down to our fans.”        
Out in the concourse, Kevin Kuffner, 34, and his girlfriend, Ariana Smith, had stepped out to take a break from the game. Asked about the Mets being stuck for what seems like forever in fourth place, Kuffner had a three-world response: “I don’t care.”        
“I hope they spend some money in the off-season, I honestly hope,” Kuffner added, sitting on a bench, his head down, his hands clasped. “It’s a New York market — you want to see them spend money.”        
Asked whom he would want the Mets to sign, Kuffner said, “I just want to see that they’re ....” he said, before pausing. “I don’t want them to be cheap. You know?”        
Out on Long Island, Ed Kranepool, a Met for 18 seasons (1962-79), including the championship year of 1969, said he would not consider a late dash to third place this season as any sign of progress. It was more complicated than that, said Kranepool, who is usually invited back by the Mets a dozen or more times a seasons to entertain fans and tell stories about the old days.        
To Kranepool, the issue is how well the younger players, like Travis d’Arnaud, Wilmer Flores, Zack Wheeler and Juan Lagares, are developing.        
It was a point of view echoed by one of Kranepool’s old Mets teammates — Ron Swoboda — who continues to follow the Mets from his home in New Orleans. Every day, he watches highlights and scans the box scores, checking the same young players Kranepool is monitoring. He, too, does not care where the Mets finish this season.        
“That’s irrelevant to me!” he said, his voice rising. “Would it make any difference if they were second? It wouldn’t make any difference to me. The number that matters is: Are you in the playoffs?”        
“I’m 69 years old,” he said, calming down. “I want to see them good again.” He let out a long, nervous laugh. “I don’t want to run out of time.”        
For the moment, time is only running out on this season, one that might very well end with the Mets back where everybody knows where to find them — in fourth place, waiting for better digs.

A judge overturned New York City’s firing of a tenured public school teacher who was arrested and charged with bringing 20 small packets of heroin into a Manhattan courthouse last year.        


In a decision this week, the judge, Manuel J. Mendez of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, ruled that the termination of the teacher, Damian Esteban, was “excessive and shocking to this court’s sense of fairness.”        
He overturned an arbitrator’s decision allowing the city’s Education Department to fire Mr. Esteban and sent the matter back to the department with orders to impose a lesser penalty.        
“The arrest was not for conduct at the school site, or involving any of its students,” Justice Mendez wrote in his six-page decision, issued Monday.        
“There is no evidence that he has a criminal record, had been arrested before or since this one incident,” he wrote. “There is no evidence that this one arrest or the publicity it generated has impaired his ability to teach or that he has lost the respect of his students.”        
On Oct. 17, Mr. Esteban, 34, of Manhattan, was arrested while returning from a recess in a murder trial where he was serving as a juror. Mr. Esteban tripped a metal detector and a court officer found a cigarette box in Mr. Esteban’s pocket with the drugs inside it, officials said.        
Mr. Esteban was charged with possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, a misdemeanor. The charges were dismissed six months later, and the record sealed, after Mr. Esteban agreed to stay out of trouble with the law and complete a one-day substance abuse education program.        
But the city still sought to fire Mr. Esteban, who had been teaching social studies and Spanish at the Williamsburg High School for Architecture and Design in Brooklyn since 2007, according to his lawyer, Eugene G. Eisner.        
In May, the arbitrator, Alan Berg, agreed that Mr. Esteban should be fired, citing his “reckless handling of dangerous drugs,” which opened the school system to ridicule and left it unsure about whether Mr. Esteban had “brought the same drugs into a school building.”        
Mr. Esteban appealed that decision to Justice Mendez, who ruled that there was “no proof to justify” the arbitrator’s conclusions.        
The ruling angered Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who promised to appeal.        
“We could not disagree more strongly with the judge’s decision,” Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement released Thursday. “The judge ruled that the termination ‘shocks the conscience,’ which shows a callous indifference to the well-being of our students. That truly shocks the conscience and boggles the mind.”        
Mr. Eisner said on Thursday that his client had been addicted to heroin, a problem that grew from when he started taking painkillers for a football injury two decades ago.        
But he said that Mr. Esteban had been clean since at least January 2012, and that he was unaware the backpack he took to court 10 months later held the cigarette box of heroin.        
Mr. Eisner said Mr. Esteban did not want to teach in the public school system again, and had been seeking a settlement from the city that would allow him to resign with a clean record, as well as about $30,000 in back pay and sick pay and reimbursement of his legal fees.        
“He’s fed up with the bureaucracy and the fact that they would do this to him,” Mr. Eisner said. “He wants to pursue other avenues and he does want to make sure his name is cleared. Right now, his name is cleared.”

ATLANTA — On Monday, Henrik Stenson beheaded his driver at the 18th hole and damaged a locker while venting over a 74, the sixth-worst final-round score at the BMW Championship.        


On Tuesday and Wednesday, he toured the East Lake Golf Club course for the first time ever, practicing the front side and merely strolling the back, then voiced concern about an aching left wrist.        
Frustration that results in destruction, unfamiliarity with the layout and soreness in a significant body part hardly add up to an ideal lead-in to the Tour Championship. But Stenson, an apparent quick learner who effectively blows off steam and suppresses mild pain, breezed through his first round Thursday with a six-under-par 64 at the event that concludes the tour season.        
Stenson stuffed five birdies into his opening seven holes, daring everyone else to catch up. One player did, for a while. Adam Scott started the back nine with six birdies in seven holes, then closed with two pars for a 65 in a happy return to Georgia after winning the Masters in Augusta five months ago. Stenson’s birdie at the par-3 18th broke the tie.        
Revisiting his Monday meltdown, Stenson said: “This was a good turnaround mentally. I stayed very levelheaded. Kept the head on — on both myself and my driver.”        
A hotheaded tendency, Stenson confessed, sometimes overtakes him. “It kind of builds up and eventually it goes over the limit,” he said.        
In his latest episode, he slammed the club that betrayed him into the turf. Then he forced a locker door to become unhinged and smashed a shelf. He apologized and offered to pay for repairs.        
“I just needed to realize the world is a good place again,” he said. “I was just tired, and I pushed myself over the edge. That’s not the best frame of mind to play good golf. I’m really delighted with the change I made.”        
Adjusting to a previously unseen course proved less daunting. At a European Tour stop in 2004, Stenson recalled, a sore neck limited him to walking an entire grounds with only two clubs. He won by four strokes.        
The ailing wrist, which Stenson said was unrelated to his tantrum, was worrisome, but he said ice, medicine and treatment eased the discomfort. On Wednesday morning, he said, gripping a toothbrush triggered pain.        
“I hope it’s just a one-off that will go away,” he said.        
A European player has never won the FedEx Cup tournament, which was instituted seven years ago and lavishes the champion with a $10 million bonus.        
Stenson, a Swede who is No. 2 in the Cup standings behind Tiger Woods, arrived as a primary contender. A tournament win would be complemented by the FedEx championship — and enough money to finance dressing room repairs many times over.        
At No. 3, Scott, a native of Australia and a resident of Switzerland, entered in the same enviable situation, but he missed three greens on wedge shots during a desultory front nine. A birdie putt at No. 10 restored his serenity and put him in the same groove he attained at the Masters.        
“I love playing great golf courses,” he said, dismissing the notion of a special Georgia alchemy, “and obviously this is one of them.”        
Stenson was paired with Woods, which some golfers find intimidating, given the sizable galleries that follow his every swing. But it was Woods, the lone multiple Cup champion, who caved, recording a 73 that was superior to only one of the other 29 contestants, Jason Dufner.        
“It’s a position where you need to be extra-focused,” Stenson said. “It’s a bit more shouting, a bit more people moving around and such. That just demands a little bit of higher concentration.”        
Unfamiliarity with the course was no hindrance, either, to another early challenger, Billy Horschel, who took an instant liking to East Lake with a 66.        
“It’s fun to finally be here,” said the high-energy Horschel, 26, who spends much of his winters on a snowboard. “I feel like a kid in a candy store.”        
Horschel was even with Steve Stricker, who has shrunk his tour schedule to spend more time with his family. As one of three players to qualify for every Tour Championship of the FedEx era, he feels right at home.        
Roberto Castro, alone at 67, is a Cup rookie but no stranger to East Lake, having filled out nearly 100 scorecards here.        
Eight golfers were bunched at 68, notably Sergio García, who heard boos on the first tee, but they were not directed at him. García’s playing partner was Boo Weekley, who attended college in Georgia and is often greeted by his nickname.        
García’s round began inauspiciously when his first shot veered left and plunked a spectator in the thigh.        
Leslie Douglas was peering at the tee, wondering if García had swung, when she got a painful answer. The ball left a bruise that did not require medical attention. García plucked another ball out of his bag, signed it and tossed her a souvenir.        
“I like watching him play,” Douglas, 22, said. “Next time, I’ll stay to the right.”

A man who planned a mass shooting at the headquarters of a conservative Christian group last year was sentenced Thursday in federal court to 25 years in prison. The defendant, Floyd Corkins II, wounded a guard in the episode. He told the authorities that he planned to kill people and smear Chick-fil-A sandwiches in their faces as a political statement at the Family Research Council. Chick-fil-A was making headlines because of its president’s opposition to gay marriage, which the council also opposes. The sentence was less than the 45 years prosecutors had sought but more than twice what the defense had suggested.

Police say Mr. Ferrell may have been seeking help after a crash when he went to a home where a frightened woman called 911 because she thought he was trying to break in.

Officials said Thursday that the agencies have awarded up to $53 million for the 2013 fiscal year for the Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science, most of it at universities. The centers can receive more than $273 million over the next five years for research on the marketing of tobacco products, adverse health effects, ways to reduce addiction and toxicity, and so-called modified risk tobacco products. The agencies say the centers will help shape tobacco regulations.

The first-floor galleries at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art were home until recently to the heart of the collection: 19th-century landscape paintings by Thomas Cole, Frederic Church and Albert Bierstadt, members of the Hudson River School, which were collected by and commissioned directly from the artists by the museum’s founders and earliest patrons. Removed last fall for the installation of a new heating and cooling system, they have been replaced by an exhibition of contemporary photographs that show a very different version — and vision — of nature.        


Instead of forests eluding the creep of industrialization or mountains and sunsets full of Romantic-era symbolism, “An Artificial Wilderness: The Landscape in Contemporary Photography” features monuments of the postindustrial landscape: gas stations, parking lots, and signs and buildings stamped with corporate logos.        
Some of the great analysts of early postwar urban sprawl are here, like Ed Ruscha, represented by a vitrine of self-published artist’s books from the 1960s. One of them, “Every Building on the Sunset Strip” (1966), is a deadpan representation of exactly what the title promises. Photographed in black and white, the buildings on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles are printed along the edges of a long piece of paper folded into an accordion configuration, with a strip of white running down the middle like a street. Two other books, “Twenty-Six Gasoline Stations” (1962) and “Thirty-Four Parking Lots” (1967), function almost like works of contemporary urban archeology, with the parking lots, photographed from above, resembling ancient burial ruins and geoglyphs.        
Bernd and Hilla Becher’s mid-’60s photographs of cooling towers in Germany document obsolete industrial structures in Europe rather than urban sprawl. Lewis Baltz, who photographed early suburban development, is represented by a much later work, “Piazza Sigmund Freud” (1989), an eerie red-pink triptych of a parking lot near the central train station in Milan. A student of the Bechers, Frank Breuer, uses the tight-cropping techniques of his teachers to frame street-sign logos — photographed, like the Bechers’ images, against a plain white sky — and rectilinear buildings that look like minimalist sculptures branded with corporate logos.        
Claire Beckett plays a similar game, photographing real buildings in such a manner that they end up looking unreal. The subject of “Above Medina Jabal Town, National Training Center, Fort Irwin, California” (2008) is a military building in which storage containers have been painted to look like a town in the Middle East. With its muted desert hues and artificial subject, the photograph looks like a digital animation or a scene from a video game.        
The works of Louise Lawler and James Welling are more conceptual in their approach, showing how highly constructed our versions of “nature” tend to be. For “Fragment/Frame/Text (#163)” (1984), Ms. Lawler photographed a museum wall label next to a landscape painting by Claude Lorrain; only a fragment of the landscape appears in the photo. Mr. Welling’s early-’80s images of tin foil, crumpled and then unfolded and photographed, have been compared to everything from night skies to the cosmos. Hung here alongside a dark photo of “Foliage” (1981), the foil photograph, “Untitled (Foil)” (1981), suggests a view into a forest as well.        
That is not to say that there are no actual forests or mountains here; it’s just that they are generally marked by human intervention. For “groundspeed (Rose Petal) #17” (2001), the Australian artist Rosemary Laing installed a carpet in a forest in New South Wales, Australia. It has been carefully integrated with the landscape — tucked under branches and roots and with a few leaves scattered on top — so that the photograph looks like a digital construction. It is instead an imaginative marriage of “artificial” nature (the carpet with its English rose pattern) and the real thing — which ends up looking fake, too.        
Ana Mendieta was well known for her performance-based photographs, like the fertility symbol in “Guanaroca (First Woman)” (1981), which she carved in a cave in Jaruco State Park outside her native Havana (after nearly two decades of exile in the United States). Also here are several photographs from her “Silueta” series from the ’70s, in which she covered her body with mud or flowers or ash and stood near trees or lay down in gravelike trenches.        
An artist who is more of a copyist than an originator is Andy Goldsworthy, whose 1996 photographs of a hole carved into a mound of snow built in the space below a low tree branch feels like a redux of works by earlier artists like Ms. Mendieta and Nancy Holt (who is not included here).        
The photographs of Edward Burtynsky, although they look artificial, are perhaps the most “real” in the show — and the most sobering. The home page of Mr. Burtynsky’s Web site includes a quotation by the artist that encourages us to have “a certain reverence for what nature is because we are connected to it,” and “if we destroy nature, we destroy ourselves.”        
Mr. Burtynsky has traveled around the world photographing despoiled sites. A photograph of a vast concentration of discarded automobile tires (at its peak, 42 million tires) is captured in the relatively deadpan “Oxford Tire Pile #1, Westley, California” (1999). But more often Mr. Burtynsky’s documents of environmental disaster are photographed at times of day and in such a fashion that they look hauntingly beautiful — earning them a place in the art world’s slightly unflattering category of “ruin pornography.” Bangladeshi ship breakers, who undertake the dirty and dangerous work of tearing apart old freighters, are captured here in photographs that are as richly romantic as a painting by Thomas Cole or Caspar David Friedrich (and with the same compositional tricks of scale: tiny humans are dwarfed by the hulking wrecks of the freighters).        
But in many ways, Mr. Burtynsky’s photographs seem the most at home in these galleries at the Wadsworth, where the elegant rooms and careful lighting created a theatrical stage for 19th-century paintings that show nature in a majestic light. They do the same for the high drama of what Mr. Burtynsky photographs: a sadder, uglier side of humans’ interaction with nature.

In the Democratic primary campaign for mayor, Bill de Blasio’s refusal to retain Raymond W. Kelly as police commissioner was framed as a cornerstone of his candidacy. His thoughts on who might run the Taxi and Limousine Commission would appear less likely to affect vote tallies in November.        


And yet, when Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday that he would immediately replace the current taxi commissioner, David S. Yassky, if elected, he convulsed an industry that has undergone widespread upheaval in recent years, inspiring a stern response from a coalition of cabbies and a fractious exchange on Twitter between a deputy mayor and a state assemblyman. (Late Thursday, a spokeswoman for Joseph J. Lhota, Mr. de Blasio’s Republican opponent, said that Mr. Lhota also would not keep Mr. Yassky.)        
The episode began Thursday morning, when Mr. de Blasio, the Democratic nominee, was asked on WWRL about his vision for the city’s taxis. “I’d start by getting a new chairman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission,” he said, adding, “I want someone who will work with the drivers.” Mr. de Blasio has been a frequent critic of the city’s Taxi of Tomorrow plan for a nearly uniform fleet of yellow cabs and its bid to expand street-hail service outside Manhattan with green livery cabs. His campaign has received over $200,000 in contributions from members of the taxi and limousine industry, many of whom opposed the Bloomberg administration’s policies.        
In a statement, Mr. Yassky — who, like many administration officials, is not expected to stay once Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg leaves office — said he had “great respect” for Mr. de Blasio.        
But Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, took immediate exception to the candidate’s remarks, calling Mr. Yassky “the most pro-driver chairperson we’ve seen.” She cited last year’s commission-approved increase in cab fares, which went directly toward higher wages for drivers, and wondered if the next administration would instead be at the “beck and call” of the taxi industry, given the campaign contributions.        
“It’s definitely worrisome,” Ms. Desai said in a phone interview.        
Howard Wolfson, a deputy mayor, also defended Mr. Yassky. When Assemblyman Micah Z. Kellner, another critic of the city’s taxi initiatives, wrote “Amen!” on Twitter in response to Mr. de Blasio’s comments, Mr. Wolfson replied, “Won’t you be looking for a new job soon?”        
Mr. Kellner, who has been accused of sexually harassing a staff member, lost a race last week for a City Council seat on the Upper East Side.        
The assemblyman responded that Mr. Wolfson would be out of a job when Mr. Bloomberg’s term ended, “and amen to that!”        
Then the exchange turned personal, if it had not already. Mr. Yassky had “passed the vet for commissioner,” the deputy mayor wrote to Mr. Kellner. “You wouldn’t.”

The little girl first came into Omar Duran’s life as a baby. As the years went by, Mr. Duran, 54, who lived above her and her mother in a tidy brick apartment house on Staten Island, watched her grow, played with her and taught her to ride her first bike.        


By the time the girl turned 10, her mother was ready for new things: she had passed an exam to become a nurse’s aide, and she was getting ready to marry her fiancé, neighbors said. And Mr. Duran, who lived alone and thought of himself as a surrogate father to the girl, grew desperate, the authorities said.        
For months, they said, Mr. Duran had been muttering jealously about Juan Cruz, who married the woman, 32, on Saturday and moved in.        
This month, Staten Islanders were repeatedly shaken by reports of bombs found on their quiet streets. One, found on Sept. 2, was behind a strip mall. Another was discovered 10 days later by a pedestrian. Two days after that, a third was picked up by a sanitation crew in a pile of garbage bags.        
Prosecutors said they were not wired to detonate, but the last two contained enough explosive material to cause serious injury if ignited. All three bore a note in Spanish with the name Juan Cruz and a nearby address.        
Mr. Duran, a custodian, was questioned on Wednesday after the police traced a car to him from surveillance camera images near one bomb site. In Staten Island Criminal Court on Thursday, he pleaded not guilty to placing a fake bomb, several counts of criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment. A judge set bail at $500,000 and ordered him not to contact the woman, her husband or her daughter.        
Describing Mr. Duran’s relationship to the woman as “family friend,” Assistant District Attorney Biju Koshy said in court that Mr. Duran had confessed to planting the bombs. The first device was an “imitation,” Mr. Koshy said, but the others included propane tanks, computer wires and a clock. At least one device carried Mr. Duran’s fingerprints.        
Police officials said Mr. Duran had worried that Mr. Cruz would supplant him as a father figure. His grudge had already led him to make several anonymous calls to the Department of Homeland Security, sharing false tips about Mr. Cruz’s supposedly illegal activities, Mr. Koshy said. But as the wedding day approached, Mr. Duran — an occasional handyman neighbors saw sprucing up the house and building a backyard gazebo — took more drastic measures, rigging crude bombs to frame Mr. Cruz, the authorities said.        
It was “all in an attempt to interrupt the wedding plans of the young woman,” Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner, said.        
To the neighbors, Mr. Duran’s calling himself a “father figure” to the girl was no fantasy. Residents of the four-apartment brick house seemed to be all part of “one big happy family,” said Charlie DeFilipo, 45, who works at the gas station and auto repair shop next door.        
Barbecuing and relaxing in the backyard, Mr. Duran, the woman, her daughter and her mother seemed to be on easy, affectionate terms — so much so that some neighbors thought he was the woman’s father or her brother, Mr. DeFilipo said. The balding Mr. Duran, his head ringed with a graying fringe, taught the young girl how to ride a bike, neighbors said; he sometimes drove the mother and daughter to their Seventh-day Adventist church.        
On his own, Mr. Duran was friendly and helpful, the kind of neighbor who would shovel your driveway after a snowstorm without being asked, said Jimmy Albunio, 83, whose backyard abuts that of the brick house. “I never would’ve thought that this would happen,” Mr. Albunio said.        
On a modest block with several families who have lived there for decades, the house where Mr. Duran lived — with its immigrant families and relatively transient renters — was something of an oddity. Mr. Duran and the woman, whose name the authorities did not release, had both lived there about a decade, neighbors said, and the girl’s biological father sometimes visited. The woman supported herself in part by baby-sitting for a neighbor, Eddie Roman, 48, said.        
Just a few days ago, Mr. Cruz had begun moving in. But by Wednesday night, the house was cordoned off with yellow police tape.        
“This was shock — I thought, ‘Not Omar, no way,’ ” Mr. DeFilipo said. “But he blew up, I guess. Love hurts. Love’s very painful.”

As the favorite to succeed Ben S. Bernanke to lead the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen faces no shortage of hurdles.        


The first would be to win confirmation from the Senate — an obstacle that doomed the previous front-runner for the job, Lawrence H. Summers.        
While Ms. Yellen faces much less potential opposition than Mr. Summers did, the White House is not taking Senate approval for granted. Even as the administration informed legislators on Capitol Hill on Thursday that Ms. Yellen probably would be President Obama’s nominee, one official said the point of the calls was not so much to gauge support but to tell Democratic senators they should defend Ms. Yellen if she comes under attack before a formal nomination.        
The second, even bigger, challenge would be to manage the central bank’s retreat from its unprecedented efforts to stimulate the economy, even as the nation’s job market remains frustratingly weak more than four years after the Great Recession.        
With the collapse of Mr. Summers’s candidacy, White House officials began calling Senate Democrats about the Fed choice; a senior Congressional aide said the only name they mentioned was Ms. Yellen’s. Since she has become the focus of public discussion, the president’s staff is worried that she could become a target for criticism, just as Mr. Summers was, before the White House actually nominates her and can defend her.        
Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who serves on the Senate Banking Committee, said in an interview Thursday that the White House had accelerated the vetting process for Ms. Yellen.        
“Certainly my impression is the White House is taking a very serious and fast-track examination of her as a potential nominee,” Mr. Merkley said.        
While Ms. Yellen enjoys strong support from Senate Democrats — a third of the caucus took the unusual step of signing a letter urging the president to nominate her, even before the White House indicated it was leaning toward Mr. Summers — Senate Republicans will be more difficult to persuade.        
Some, like Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, an influential member of the Banking Committee, have expressed reservations about her leadership in the past. Mr. Shelby voted against confirming her as vice chairwoman of the Fed in 2010.        
Despite the opposition, Ms. Yellen, if nominated, is expected to win Senate confirmation and assume the leadership of the Fed early next year.        
Mr. Bernanke handed his successor a gift this week when the central bank surprised Wall Street and many economists by not easing the stimulus effort.        
On Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke walked back his earlier suggestion that the Fed’s huge bond-buying effort would cease when the unemployment rate fell to 7 percent, instead leaving the door open for that form of stimulus to continue well into 2014 and perhaps beyond, even if that jobless threshold is breached.        
That flexibility is something that Ms. Yellen might well take advantage of. As the most prominent member of the Fed’s dovish flank, other than Mr. Bernanke himself, Ms. Yellen has focused more on the dismal state of the labor market and the pressures facing poor and middle-class families than on the potential threat of financial instability and inflation down the road.        
In a major speech in February, Ms. Yellen highlighted not only the elevated unemployment rate, but also long-term joblessness, the high poverty rate, sluggish wage growth, labor force dropouts and homelessness as major reasons for the Fed to continue the stimulus. “The effects of the recession and the subsequent slow recovery have been harshest on some of the most vulnerable Americans,” Ms. Yellen said.        
While the unemployment rate has fallen steadily, hitting a five-year low of 7.3 percent in August, much of that improvement has come from workers dropping out of the labor force rather than vigorous job creation. The monthly pace of new jobs has slowed, falling from well over 200,000 new jobs being added each month at the end of 2012 to 169,000 in August 2013.        
A more telling indicator of the continuing weakness of the economy, analysts say, is the proportion of Americans who are part of the labor force, which in August hit 63.2 percent, a 35-year low. While some of that decline is because of structural factors like the retirement of baby boomers and the continuing shift from industrial jobs, the trend has accelerated significantly since 2007, prompting many economists to conclude it is primarily a cyclical phenomenon that can be cured only by faster economic growth.        
Mr. Bernanke, in fact, highlighted the falling participation rate in a news conference after the Fed’s decision on Wednesday.

For generations, families have dreaded and despised the exam used to determine the fate of 4- and 5-year-olds seeking entry into the elite world of New York City private schools.        


But next year, the test, commonly known as the E.R.B., is likely to be dropped as an entry requirement by most of the schools. A group representing the schools announced this week that, because of concerns that the popularity of test-preparation programs and coaching had rendered its results meaningless, it would no longer recommend that its members use the test.        
“It creates a lot of anxiety in families and kids that is unnecessary,” said Patricia Hayot, the head of Chapin School, who leads the group, the Independent School Admissions Association of Greater New York. “We’re being brave. We’re trying to explore a new way.”        
The decision quickly upended the frenzied arena of private school admissions. The association represents 130 private and independent schools, including some of the city’s most respected institutions: The Dalton School, Riverdale Country School and Packer Collegiate Institute, among others.        
While the schools are free to continue using the exam, Dr. Hayot said she expected the vast majority to scrap it after the association’s contract with the exam’s administrator ends next spring. (At least one school, Horace Mann, said on Thursday that it would stick with the test.)        
For years, public and private schools across the country have grappled with questions about the value of standardized admissions exams. The city’s Education Department, responding to concerns that too many children were being coached for the test to enter gifted and talented programs, modified its own exam this year, which backfired when even more students qualified for the programs.        
The rise of the test-preparation industry, with guidebooks, tutoring sessions and sample questions aplenty, has raised questions about whether standardized tests accurately measure a child’s abilities. But a viable alternative has proved to be elusive, given the desire for a way to measure students against a single yardstick.        
The Educational Records Bureau, the nonprofit organization after which the test is named and which administers the exam for private school admissions, defended the test on Thursday.        
“We feel having a uniform assessment is in the best interest of schools, parents and children,” said Elizabeth Mangas, a vice president of the organization. “We look forward to working with the schools going forward.”        
Ms. Mangas said that in recent surveys of private schools in New York City, 80 percent reported that they found the E.R.B. to be useful. The exam’s makers also argued that the growing use of test-preparation programs was not skewing the results, pointing to data showing that average scores had remained roughly the same over time.        
But Dr. Hayot said that a task force assembled by the schools association had found the results to be “tainted” by test preparation and recommended that the exam no longer be used in admissions for kindergarten and first grade, the common entry points for private elementary school. Last year, 3,173 students took the test for those grades, according to the bureau, which has administered the test since 1966.        
The E.R.B. test is derived from an exam known as the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, which measures, among other things, vocabulary and the ability to identify geometric shapes. At many admissions offices, test scores are considered alongside interviews with prospective families and students, recommendations from preschools and observations of students in group settings.        
The association is working with experts to develop a new assessment by February. Dr. Hayot said it was too early to say what the assessments would look like, but she said the group was considering ways of measuring noncognitive skills, like resilience and attention span. She also said the group might consider providing written evaluations of students, rather than a score.        
George P. Davison, head of Grace Church School, said he hoped a new assessment would emphasize the ability to identify numbers and letters, and test a student’s fine-motor skills.        
“If a 4-year-old can’t recognize their name, that tells you something useful,” he said. “You’re not going to hire a $2,000 tutor to teach them their name.”        
Finding an adequate substitute could prove challenging. For all the criticism of the test, it provided a valuable tool for schools having to wade through hundreds or thousands of applicants, and having a single test used by virtually every school, SAT-style, kept young students from enduring a battery of them.        
Victoria Goldman, the author of a guide to elite schools in New York, said it was important to have a way to independently evaluate students in what can otherwise be a highly subjective process.        
“You are making a decision with these families for 13 years in some cases,” she said. “That’s like a marriage. It’s really important to know what you’re dealing with.”        
The test-preparation industry, which has blossomed in New York, greeted the decision tepidly, predicting that parents would soon be searching for ways to train their children for the new exams, however different they might be.        
“Any uncertainty that you place in the process creates an absolute boom in test prep,” said Suzanne Rheault, chief executive of Aristotle Circle, one of the city’s more popular coaching programs. “People prep. They try to get information. They don’t want their kids to be guinea pigs.”        
But several private school leaders rejoiced on Thursday. “I didn’t think I would see it in my lifetime,” said Lydia Spinelli, director of the Brick Church School, an Upper East Side school for children ages 3 through 6, many of whom take the E.R.B. to get into private elementary schools. “For too long, it’s been a cloud over our practice.”        
Perhaps no group will be more relieved than parents, who must now pay more than $500 just to take the exam, even before shelling out money for practice books and tutors.        
Anne Yoakam Ellsworth, 43, a resident of the Upper East Side who writes a blog about parenting and politics, recalled trying to get her daughter, Rosemary, now 9, into a private school that prohibited practice courses or exams. She said the situation was frustrating. Many parents wanted to follow the rules, but they worried about leaving their children at a disadvantage.        
“I think it’s great,” she said of the decision to end the test. “It causes some parents so much anxiety.”

ATLANTA — Jason Dufner walked off East Lake Golf Club’s ninth green on Thursday after making an eight-foot birdie putt with his shoulders slouched, his cap pulled over his eyes, his gaze directed downward. Dufner, the reigning P.G.A. champion, is known for his impassivity, but his posture straightened and his lips nearly curved into a smile when a fan in the crowd shouted, “War Eagle!”        


Dufner, 36, has two great loves: his wife, Amanda; and Auburn football. For Dufner and other avid college sports fans, weekends in the fall are a comfort-food potluck of prognosticating, tailgating, spectating, and second-guessing or crowing.        
If he were not at this week’s season-ending Tour Championship, Dufner, who was last in the field after an opening four-over 74, would be gearing up for Auburn’s game Saturday at L.S.U. The start of autumn is the time sports fans give thanks for their bountiful viewing choices. In addition to the college football season getting in gear, the N.F.L. is back in action, and the baseball season is winding down while wild-card races are tightening up. And then there are the golf playoffs, with the best players in the world spending a month jockeying for a $10 million bonus.        
The FedEx Cup playoffs have provided great theater, with Adam Scott winning the Barclays while on the range preparing for a possible playoff; Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson playing in the same group at the Deutsche Bank Championship; and Jim Furyk tying the tour scoring record with a 59 in the second round of the BMW Championship. Henrik Stenson, one of five players in the field who would win the bonus with a victory here, produced additional drama with four consecutive birdies Thursday on his way to a pace-setting six-under 64.        
It has been a great diversion from raking leaves for people already ardent about golf. But are the playoffs delivering a new audience to the game? Dufner doubts it.        
“Golf fans are always going to watch golf no matter if football’s going on or not,” he said. “But you’re going to have a tough time pulling guys away from watching their favorite universities, their favorite N.F.L. teams, during this time of year. I don’t think us doing the playoffs really has that much of an impact on it.”        
Aided by a late charge from Woods, who finished one stroke behind Scott, the final-round coverage of the Barclays, the first event of the PGA Tour FedEx Cup, earned a 3.7 overnight rating on CBS, up from 2.7 last year. Nielsen figures showed the final round of the Deutsche Bank Championship, the next event, had 3.2 million viewers on NBC, down 34 percent from 2012, when the final round was the most-viewed FedEx Cup telecast since 2007.        
Golf Channel’s coverage of Furyk’s sub-60 round drew an audience of just under 1.1 million.        
“The guys that are into football aren’t going to pay too much attention to the playoffs, especially at the beginning of the year,” Dufner said. “Guys are excited about their teams or their fantasy teams or universities that they went to or root for. I even find myself in the same predicament at times, wishing that I could attend games or watch games.”        
Auburn’s game at L.S.U. is at night, which means Dufner will not have to ask for scoring updates the way players with other allegiances have the past two Saturdays.        
“I’m glad that I’m playing at East Lake and definitely putting my best foot forward,” Dufner said, “but another part of me was wishing that maybe I was at home enjoying a couple of beers and watching some football.”        
The third playoff event, the BMW Championship, had a Monday finish because of inclement weather, which sent sighs through the television broadcasting trailer and booth and sent everybody else scurrying to change travel arrangements. But Dufner found the rainbow after Sunday’s daylong rain.        
“We weren’t playing,” he said, “so we got to watch some football.”        
Brandt Snedeker, the reigning FedEx Cup champion, is a fan of his alma mater, Vanderbilt, and his home-state N.F.L. team, the Tennessee Titans. He said he had received texts from people who told him they were switching back and forth on the weekends between football games and the golf telecasts.        
Speaking of the playoffs, Snedeker, who carded a 69, said, “The last four weeks going up against the N.F.L., I think it’s our best product.” He added: “I would like to think it is making a dent, because you have Tiger, Phil playing, and there are a bunch of different scenarios playing out this week that can really draw a viewer in.”        
In a news conference Tuesday, the PGA Tour commissioner, Tim Finchem, pointed to the television viewership throughout the year as evidence that golf’s popularity is on an upswing.        
“We had 165 million different Americans tune in at one point in time,” Finchem said. “Over 100 million tune in on 10 or 12 events or more.”        
Keegan Bradley, an unabashed fan of New England teams, was asked Thursday which he had perused first this past month: the golf results and FedEx Cup rankings or Red Sox box scores and Patriots game summaries? Bradley, after carding a 72, did not hesitate. “Baseball and football,” he said, “and what the Celtics are doing for sure.”

For the insurance industry, they are a familiar bugaboo: the people who stalk accident scenes and emergency rooms seeking patients to deliver to medical clinics for costly treatment.        


Far less frequently encountered are police officers abetting that process, which insurance investigators say frequently ends in fraud.        
But Queens prosecutors said on Thursday that two officers accepted bribes to provide accident information to so-called runners for local clinics.        
The officers, from neighboring precincts in northern Queens, were identified as Danny Cano, 36, and Roberto Espinal, 44. They were not working in concert, officials said, but are accused of independently taking money in exchange for providing accident victims’ personal details from official Police Department paperwork.        
And they did so for often modest sums, prosecutors said, ranging from $40 to $1,500.        
Mr. Cano, an officer for seven years, and Mr. Espinal, an officer for nine, were suspended without pay. If convicted, they face the loss of their jobs and pensions and up to seven years in prison. They were arraigned in Queens criminal court on Wednesday. Bail was set at $15,000 for Mr. Cano and $10,000 for Mr. Espinal, and both were released on Thursday.        
Lawyers for the two officers did not respond to phone calls requesting comment.        
Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly commended the work of Internal Affairs detectives who built the case against the two officers, and said on Thursday at a news conference that the investigation was continuing into the surrounding nexus of runners, medical clinics and police officers.        
While there have been no other arrests thus far, prosecutors suggested that the runners — who were not identified — were paid to bring victims to particular clinics or doctors. It was part of a “scheme to maximize cases involving insurance providers,” said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney.        
According to the criminal complaint against him, Mr. Cano, of the 115th Precinct in Jackson Heights, provided whole accident reports or information from those reports of at least 13 accident victims, garnering $6,200 in bribes over the course of five months this year.        
Mr. Espinal, working out of the 110th Precinct in Elmhurst, was paid at least $1,500 in bribes from a runner for information on seven victims over roughly the same period, according to the complaint against him. In several instances, Mr. Espinal received text messages requesting the information and took payments of as little as $40, the complaint said.        
Kevin Gallagher, a retired sergeant who worked in the auto crimes unit of the Police Department, said it was not the first time officials with access to victim information had been pulled into the unsavory world of ambulance chasing.        
“We’ve seen it in the past where employees of the hospitals will give it out to a runner,” said Mr. Gallagher, who now works in the New York office of the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a liaison between law enforcement and the insurance industry. “Everybody who came in with an accident, they would pass on information.”        
Insurance industry experts said there was indeed a timeworn method of creating fraudulent or exaggerated claims: find a real accident, massage the details or the nature of the injuries to make them sound worse, perhaps add a few more victims, file and collect.        
Accident information is sought to “give a legitimate background to a medical claim,” Frank Scafidi, a spokesman for the insurance crime bureau, said.        
To find potential accidents, insurance investigators say, those involved in such schemes pay runners to bring patients to certain clinics that will sign off on the manufactured or exaggerated injuries, offering payments in the hundreds of dollars.          
“It’s not illegal in New York,” Mr. Gallagher said of the runners acting as go-betweens for clinics. But, he added, they could be classified as co-conspirators if there were a fraud investigation into the clinic. The police declined to say whether arrests of doctors or other clinic workers could be expected from the investigation.        
Not all of the schemes involve bribery, Mr. Gallagher said. “Some of them set up a staged accident, just get a bunch of their friends into a car, rent a U-Haul truck and slam it into the back.”

"
Weekend,"







                            A sense of divine justice seizes us whenever two of the world’s prettiest people find each other. This was true when Taylor met Burton, when Brad met Angelina, when Paris met Helen, or even when Narcissus met his reflection. We just can’t help sighing over the glory of separate souls wrapped in the luxury of shared beauty. Then there’s that other part of us that thinks, both fearfully and hopefully, “It can’t last.”        


                            Such thoughts are inevitably stirred by David Leveaux’s lopsided production of “Romeo and Juliet,” which opened on Thursday night at the Richard Rodgers Theater, with the equally exquisite-looking Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad in the title roles. When these doomed lovers first set eyes on each other, it’s so obvious that they’re a matched set — and that they know it — that the whole world seems to stand still in deference.        

                            Though the kiss they subsequently share is long and deep, it doesn’t feel like the product of teenage lust. The chemistry is less erotic than aesthetic. This doesn’t mean that the connection isn’t real, and it’s hard not to feel protective of porcelain figurines that are destined to fall and shatter. That one of them is white and the other black may underscore the division between their families, yet it registers as irrelevant when they’re together.        

                            As a director, Mr. Leveaux has always believed in the power of loveliness. This is the man who gave us a “Fiddler on the Roof” (2004) that looked as if it had been styled for a Russian Vogue shoot. With “Romeo and Juliet,” his trust in appearances is not entirely misplaced. Mr. Bloom, in a first-rate Broadway debut, and the gifted Ms. Rashad exude a too-fine-for-this-world purity that makes their characters’ love feel sacred. It seems right that they should speak in some of Shakespeare’s most gossamer-spun poetry, which they do with beguiling effortlessness. 

                            Yet, while the production features stunning columns of flame as part of its eclectic mise-en-scène, it never acquires the fiery, all-consuming urgency that “Romeo and Juliet” should deliver. Cut to a fast 2 hours and 20 minutes, this version may well leave you glowing and misty-eyed at the conclusion of its first half, which ends shortly after a genuinely luminous balcony scene. But the tragic events that follow pass in such an anticlimactic blur that when our hero and heroine finally off themselves, it’s hard to feel bereft.        

                            Featuring an era-straddling set by Jesse Poleshuck, which suggests a contemporary Italian city long past its Renaissance glory days, the show has a certain elegant sparseness. Yet it also feels overstuffed — visually, aurally and conceptually. A giant, ominous bell is periodically raised and lowered, ready to toll for you know who. A well-behaved white dove appears for the prologue (spoken by Brent Carver, who plays Friar Laurence). And a frescoed wall, its Botticelli-esque figures overwritten with graffiti, slides in and out of view.        

                            The writing on that wall brings to mind “Romeo + Juliet,” the hit 1996 movie by Baz Luhrmann, which starred a young Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes and was set in a trendy beach town. And I suspect that Mr. Leveaux is hoping to capture some of the youth appeal of that film, along with that of Franco Zeffirelli’s countercultural screen version of 1968. (David Van Tieghem’s background music cheekily quotes the opening notes of the earlier film’s theme song.)        

                            Hence we have Romeo arriving, leader-of-the-pack style, on a motorcycle, his jeans fashionably torn at the knees. (Fabio Toblini did the costumes.) As a star entrance, it’s both cumbersome and embarrassing, though I guess it’s meant to establish the character’s bad-boy credentials. In contrast, Juliet is first glimpsed giggling her way through a pillow fight, making us think of her as still very much a little girl.        

                            I’ve developed a lot of respect for Juliet’s perceptiveness in recent years, especially after seeing Lauren Ambrose’s smart and spirited interpretation for Shakespeare in the Park in 2007. In that version, directed by Michael Greif, it was clear that in this star-crossed relationship, it was the girl who was the mature one.

WASHINGTON — Only two weeks after Washington and the nation were debating a unilateral military strike on Syria that was also intended as a forceful warning to Iran about its nuclear program, President Obama finds himself at the opening stages of two unexpected diplomatic initiatives with America’s biggest adversaries in the Middle East, each fraught with opportunity and danger.        


Without much warning, diplomacy is suddenly alive again after a decade of debilitating war in the region. After years of increasing tension with Iran, there is talk of finding a way for it to maintain a face-saving capacity to produce a very limited amount of nuclear fuel while allaying fears in the United States and Israel that it could race for a bomb.        
Syria, given little room for maneuver, suddenly faces imminent deadlines to account for and surrender its chemical weapons stockpiles — or risk losing the support of its last ally, Russia.        
For Mr. Obama, it is a shift of fortunes that one senior American diplomat described this week as “head spinning.”        
In their more honest moments, White House officials concede they got here the messiest way possible — with a mix of luck in the case of Syria, years of sanctions on Iran and then some unpredicted chess moves executed by three players Mr. Obama deeply distrusts: President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and Iran’s erratic mullahs. But, the officials say, these are the long-delayed fruits of the administration’s selective use of coercion in a part of the world where that is understood.        
“The common thread is that you don’t achieve diplomatic progress in the Middle East without significant pressure,” Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, said Thursday. “In Syria, it was the serious threat of a military strike; in Iran it was a sanctions regime built up over five years.”        
Skeptics — and there are plenty in the National Security Council, the Pentagon, America’s intelligence agencies and Congress — are not so optimistic. They think Mr. Obama runs the risk of being dragged into long negotiations and constant games of hide-and-seek that, ultimately, will result in little change in the status quo. They argue that the president’s hesitance to pull the trigger on Tomahawk strikes on Syria nearly two weeks ago, and the public and Congressional rebellion at the idea of even limited military strikes, were unmistakable signals to the Syrian and Iranian elites that if diplomacy fails, the chances of military action ordered by the American president are slight.        
“These two situations are deeply intertwined,” said Dennis B. Ross, who served as Mr. Obama’s lead adviser on Iran for the first three years of his presidency, and who argued for attacking Syria after the Aug. 21 gas attacks that killed more than a thousand civilians. “If the Syrians are forced to give up their weapons, it will make a difference to the Iranian calculation,” and would raise the prospects of some deal with Tehran.        
“If the Syrians can drag this out and give up just a little, that will send a very different message to the supreme leader,” he said.        
Hovering over it all is a third negotiation: Secretary of State John Kerry’s effort to jump-start talks between Israel and the Palestinians, a political minefield that Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry’s predecessor, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for the most part avoided.        
All these possibilities could evaporate quickly; just ask the State Department diplomats who in the last years of the Bush administration thought they were on the way to keeping North Korea from adding to its nuclear arsenal, or the Clinton administration officials who thought they were on the verge of a Middle East peace deal.        
Mr. Obama will most likely know whether the Syrian accord stands a chance of success long before he knows whether the sudden Iranian charm offensive is real or a mirage. The Syrians now face a series of deadlines. The first comes this weekend, when they must issue a declaration of their chemical stocks that “passes the laugh test,” as Gary Samore, Mr. Obama’s former top adviser on unconventional weapons, put it earlier in the week.

NEWARK — A New Jersey municipal judge who is also an established stand-up comedian and actor resigned on Thursday after the State Supreme Court ruled he cannot moonlight as an entertainer.        


The judge, Vince A. Sicari, said he tendered his resignation after the court released a unanimous opinion that said his acting and comedy career was “incompatible” with judicial conduct codes and essentially gave him the choice of doing one or the other.        
“I’m not surprised by the result, but I’m very disappointed,” said Mr. Sicari, a 44-year-old lawyer. “I take great pride in being a judge, and to give that up is disappointing.”        
Mr. Sicari, whose stage name is Vince August, has carved out a career as a comic and actor, appearing on network television and in New York City comedy clubs, and warming up Comedy Central audiences. He was also a part-time municipal judge in South Hackensack, where he handled matters like traffic ticket cases and disorderly persons offenses.        
Several justices questioned whether the public could separate Mr. Sicari’s position as a judge from roles he has played on the ABC hidden camera show “What Would You Do?” in which he has portrayed homophobic and racist characters. That quandary played a central role in the ruling on Thursday, as the justices noted that someone tuning into the show might not know that actors were used in the sketches. They applied the same standard for Mr. Sicari’s stand-up performances.        
“In the course of his routines, Sicari has demeaned certain people based on national origin and religion and has revealed his political leanings,” according to the court’s opinion. “The court cannot ignore the distinct possibility that a person who has heard a routine founded on humor disparaging certain ethnic groups and religions will not be able to readily accept that the judge before whom he or she appears can maintain the objectivity and impartiality that must govern all municipal court proceedings.”        
Mr. Sicari’s lawyer, E. Drew Britcher, said his client never cracked wise on the bench and never let on that he moonlighted as a comic. In his comedy routine, Mr. Britcher added, Mr. Sicari refrained from jokes about the legal profession and never divulged his judicial job.        
A lawyer for the state attorney general’s office, Kim D. Ringler, argued against Mr. Sicari’s being allowed to hold both jobs, saying municipal judges represent the most frequent contact that the public has with the justice system. Some of the characters Mr. Sicari has depicted could confuse the public and reflect badly on the judiciary, she said.        
Mr. Sicari, of the Screen Actors Guild and other professional performers’ unions, has said his entertainment work entitles him to health benefits and earns him more than his $13,000 salary as a part-time municipal judge.        
“I’ve been balancing these professions my entire career,” he said. “I have a passion for all of them. If I didn’t have a passion, this wouldn’t be a Supreme Court case.”        
Mr. Sicari said he would continue practicing law.

SAN FRANCISCO — After a 10-year wait, Emirates Team New Zealand and its skipper, Dean Barker, had to wait at least one more day as they attempted to win back the America’s Cup.        


Their nautically minded nation was again poised to party on Thursday, with a rowdy crowd gathered in front of the big screens at America’s Cup Park and a bigger crowd gathered in faraway Auckland to watch in Shed 10 on the city’s waterfront.        
Team New Zealand still needs one more victory to secure the 34th America’s Cup, but a decade’s worth of pent-up angst and expectation remains unreleased.        
Thursday delivered a one-two punch to the Kiwis. Punch 1 came from the defender, Oracle Team USA, which was poised and deeply impressive from the start of the first race despite facing match point, winning by 31 seconds. Punch 2 was delivered by the wind limits that have turned this new-age Cup into an all-too-familiar waiting game and forced the second race to be delayed and ultimately called off even though both AC72s had already entered the start box.        
It was the third straight day with at least one race postponed. The Kiwis, who lost the Cup in Auckland in 2003, lead this series, 8-2. Conspiracy theorists, who tend to thrive in this high-stakes and low-disclosure microcosm, may be tempted to see the delays as a way of prolonging the inevitable and the merchandise sales after this regatta’s disappointing preliminary phases, which began in July with an uncompetitive challenger series and has only now picked up the pace.        
But the regatta director, Iain Murray, has simply been responding to the weather data and directives delivered to his computer on the committee boat. The current wind limits were established in May for safety reasons after the death of the British sailor Andrew Simpson in a training accident in San Francisco Bay, and there is no agreement from the teams on change.        
On Monday, Oracle proposed to Team New Zealand that the wind limit to start a race be raised to 24 knots from 23 and that the fixed wind-speed limit in effect after the start should be removed.        
But Team New Zealand, which would have had to agree to take the proposal any further, declined, saying the regatta was already well under way.        
“We want to race; that’s why we’re here,” said James Spithill, the Oracle skipper and helmsman, with his Kiwi counterpart, Barker, sitting next to him at a news conference.        
“I think if you look at the level of these two teams now, we are way above where we were when Iain made those recommendations,” Spithill said of Murray. “We have two of the world’s best teams in sailing out there, and we’ve got a beautiful breeze like this in the afternoon and we have to come ashore.”        
“You sort of ask yourself what we’re doing out here,” Spithill said. “But it takes two teams to agree and if these guys don’t want to do it, then we’ll just keep bumping into this problem each day.”        
There has been considerable friction between Team New Zealand and Oracle Team USA, which is being run by Russell Coutts, the former Team New Zealand star who defected to the Swiss syndicate Alinghi for the 2003 Cup and ended up wresting it away from his onetime protégé Barker and the Kiwis.        
Coutts’s once-adoring compatriots have not forgotten. Nor have Oracle’s sailors forgotten that Team New Zealand’s managing director, Grant Dalton, was particularly vocal when Oracle was accused of cheating in preliminary races in smaller boats. Oracle ended up being hit with a two-race penalty, which means that although it has won four races in this series, it is getting scoreboard credit for only two.        
“We were shocked with the decision,” Spithill sad. “There’s no question about it, but what can I do about it? Absolutely nothing, and the team can’t do anything about it.”        
Despite the back story, the wind-limit sniping was a public shift in tone for this series. Barker said Oracle actually argued for even lower wind limits in May before agreeing to the 23-knot ceiling. Barker said Team New Zealand was in favor of 25 knots during the May discussions but had now prepared and updated its boat for the new limit.        
“It just seems a little bit strange that halfway through a series you feel you need to change a wind limit that has been agreed,” Barker said. “Prior to racing we would have agreed. We just don’t think it’s right in the middle of a series.”        
The Kiwis believe that Oracle would not be arguing now for higher wind limits if it did not happen to be sailing particularly well in stronger conditions. Spithill said his team’s conservative approach in May was due to Simpson’s death.        
“It was a huge tragedy,” he said. “But as we’ve both gone along, and I think since the start of this regatta the confidence both teams have got now, and you see the racing, how hard we’re pushing, it seems like the teams are up for it.”        
Apparently not. But Spithill continues to project plenty of positive energy and, with the Cup in the balance, he clearly won the start on Thursday after Barker and Team New Zealand got too close to the line too early. Spithill performed a cocksure hook maneuver to get around the Kiwis and forced them to tack away from the line to avoid a penalty.        
Oracle crossed the start with a three-boat-length lead and never trailed, looking particularly impressive upwind: fully foiling and hitting speeds in excess of 30 knots that once would have been unthinkable in Cup racing.        
“I thought the way the guys were sailing the boat was the best we’ve sailed it,” Spithill said. “Upwind and foiling in that sort of breeze was pretty impressive, and it was really just zero mistakes.”        
More, much more, glitch-free sailing will presumably be required if Spithill and his crew are to keep postponing Kiwi celebrations and work toward what would be the greatest America’s Cup comeback in its 162-year history.

BOSTON — No one seemed happier the other day than Mayor Thomas M. Menino as he joined in the ceremonial groundbreaking for a high-rise tower at the site of the old Filene’s department store in downtown Boston.        


Under blue skies, a brass band struck up a Sousa march, a forest worth of white confetti swirled down on the assembled crowd and the mayor, wearing a sharp new suit and tie, proclaimed the dawn of a new era.        
“The start of construction celebrates the beginning of a new chapter in the history of this historic building and highlights the promising future that is in store for this neighborhood,” he said.        
It is a scene that has been repeating itself with some frequency these days as Mr. Menino, the city’s longest-serving mayor, prepares to leave office. During his 20-year tenure, he has overseen the addition of 80 million square feet of development, increasing the city’s total square footage of office and residential space by 11 percent.        
The projects range from the $1 billion Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, completed in 2004, to almost 12,000 college dormitory rooms. He has backed a new casino; he proposed spending $16 billion in private and public money to build 30,000 housing units by 2020; and developers are planning a new residential tower at the Christian Science Plaza that, at 691 feet, will become the tallest residential building in the Boston skyline.        
“We call it the Menino effect,” said Peter Meade, director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, which oversees all construction projects in the city.        
As Mr. Menino’s time in City Hall runs out, the pace of development is accelerating, evidenced by the construction cranes puncturing the cityscape at virtually every turn. Last year, about $4 billion was invested in projects; this year, $5.1 billion is expected.        
The vibrant local economy — fueled by growth in food service and computer-related industries, with a strong underpinning in biotechnology, education and health care — is driving the building boom. Moody’s last year called Boston “the strongest commercial real estate market in the country since the 2008 recession.”        
Those industries are growing along with the city’s population, which reached 636,000 in 2012 — not as high as its peak of 800,000 in 1950, but up more than 3 percent since 2010.        
The building spree may be partly a function of Mr. Menino himself. “Three years ago, the mayor said, ‘I want to get stuff done,’ ” Mr. Meade recalled. “So this is the B.R.A. being committed to getting stuff done.”        
Others have suggested that the mayor’s departure may be prompting some developers to speed up their plans because they expect the change in administrations to slow down the process, at least initially, as new people move into new jobs.        
“You have the demand, and interest rates are still relatively low, but this is coupled with a fear of the unknown,” said Michael K. Vaughan, president of Nauset Strategies, a real estate consulting firm.        
“Developers, property owners, builders have 20 years invested in this relationship,” he said. “There’s a sense of, Let’s get this stuff done because you don’t know what’s around the corner.”        
Some of the candidates who are running to succeed Mr. Menino — the preliminary election, with 12 candidates, is Tuesday — want him to scale back, worrying that his $16 billion housing plan in particular could saddle the city with debt. Another concern is that the building boom is gentrifying some neighborhoods to the point where residents are being priced out.        
“We’re committing to so many things, I worry we’ll be handcuffed,” Bill Walczak, one of the candidates, said at a recent debate.        
Mr. Menino brushed off the criticism, saying he intended to finish his tenure on a strong note and would be rolling out even more initiatives in the coming weeks.        
After two decades in office, Mr. Menino’s hold over every aspect of city life is complete and his power to make or break any construction project is legendary.        
The Filene’s property is a case in point. A few years ago, it was being developed by Vornado Realty Trust, based in New York, but construction had stalled because of the recession, leaving a crater in the middle of the city’s historic shopping district.        
The company’s chief executive, Steven Roth, suggested that he might have deliberately allowed the site to become an eyesore to put pressure on the city for a tax break. This incensed the mayor, who gave no tax break. Vornado never resumed construction, and eventually Millennium Partners, another New York developer — but one with a good relationship with the mayor — took over the project.        
On the eve of the groundbreaking this week, the Menino administration reversed itself and agreed to give $7.8 million in tax breaks to help Millennium Partners attract retail and office tenants to the $630 million development. At the groundbreaking, the mayor defended the tax credits, saying the project would generate $60 million in new property taxes and stimulate the downtown economy.        
David Begelfer, chief executive of Naiop Massachusetts, a commercial real estate development association, said that market forces rather than a mayor drive a building boom. But he suggested nonetheless that Mr. Menino might have been thinking of his legacy when he proposed building the 30,000 new housing units.        
And of the tax break for the Filene’s project, Mr. Begelfer laughed and said: “There is something to be said for having a relationship with the power that be.”

DETROIT — In an emotional hearing, Detroit residents protesting the city’s bankruptcy filing pleaded on Thursday with a federal judge to protect employee pensions and essential services from cuts they said would be devastating.        


William J. Howard, who retired after 35 years in the city’s Water Department, described working nights and weekends repairing Detroit’s sewers and incinerators.        
“During that time, I worked in human waste with my fellow employees, working to serve the city of Detroit,” Mr. Howard said. “My fellow employees and I are entitled to a pension. I pray that Your Honor objects to this bankruptcy.”        
His testimony and that of others homed in on some of the toughest questions before the judge, Steven W. Rhodes of United States Bankruptcy Court, as the case heads toward critical hearings next month on Detroit’s eligibility to file for Chapter 9.        
Opponents of the bankruptcy, led by the city’s public employee unions, have argued that the filing in July violated Michigan’s Constitution, which expressly protects pension rights for workers.        
They also assert that the state-appointed emergency manager, Kevyn D. Orr, did not bargain fairly with unions, bondholders and other creditors to cut costs and debt before recommending bankruptcy — the nation’s largest municipal bankruptcy filing — to Gov. Rick Snyder. The city is trying to reduce an estimated $18.5 billion in long-term debt.        
Judge Rhodes has so far reserved decision on the pension and bargaining issues until formal eligibility hearings start on Oct. 23. He also ordered hundreds of creditors to participate in mediation sessions before then to possibly reduce some of the city’s debts.        
But the judge made it clear Thursday that he considers the testimony of residents, retirees and community leaders to be a key element in deciding whether Detroit should be in bankruptcy, and how its 700,000 residents and rank-and-file workers should be treated.        
“Everyone who has a stake in the outcome of this case should take the time to listen to this,” the judge said.        
The hearing had its difficult moments. One woman, Lucinda Darrah, was removed by a security guard when she refused to leave the microphone after the three-minute limit. And tempers flared at times when residents raised a racial issue: whether Mr. Snyder, a Republican who is white, had deliberately imposed emergency managers on several Michigan cities that have largely black populations.        
Sheilah Johnson, who worked for the city for 28 years, said she feared losing her $3,000 monthly pension, and blamed Mr. Orr and Mr. Snyder for seizing control of the city from its voters and elected officials.        
“We do not need a dictator,” she said. “We do not need a slave owner. I’m not a slave.”        
While Judge Rhodes cautioned people against making personal attacks on Mr. Orr and others, the frustration and anger of many homeowners and retirees repeatedly boiled over.        
Paulette Brown, who rose from a junior typist to a manager during her 30-year career with the city, said longtime employees were being “treated worse than animals” in the bankruptcy. “I object to being referred to as a creditor,” she said. “We did our part and we need the city of Detroit to continue to do theirs.”        
Others expressed concern that the dismal state of city services like police and fire protection would get worse because of cuts imposed in bankruptcy.        
One resident, Jean Vorkamp, told of how a gunshot victim lay dead on her street last month for five hours because of staffing reductions in the county coroner’s office.        
“This is austerity,” she said. “And there is no more room for any more austerity in Detroit.”        
Bankruptcy experts said that allowing residents and retirees to testify was a prudent and compassionate move by Judge Rhodes, but not one that will likely affect whether the city is found legally eligible to file for bankruptcy.        
“An individual objector that doesn’t have a lot of resources was probably not going to make an adequate case with sufficient evidence to overcome the city’s arguments on those issues,” said Michael A. Sweet, a bankruptcy lawyer with the firm Fox Rothschild.        
Yet the stirring anecdotal testimony of regular Detroiters seemed to frame the case in ways far different from the legal issues at stake.        
Cynthia Blair, the widow of a Detroit police officer, said she relies on her husband’s pension to make a home for her family. “The bankruptcy could take me and my daughter’s pension away,” she said. “And we would be thrown directly to the welfare rolls.”        
About half of the 110 individuals who filed objections to the bankruptcy testified on Thursday. Judge Rhodes said he found their statements “moving, thoughtful and passionate,” and called the hearing a “truly extraordinary session of the court.”        
A second hearing on Thursday addressed a motion by a retirees committee representing former city workers. The committee is seeking a stay of the bankruptcy and all further hearings until the Michigan constitutional issues are settled.        
The committee’s lawyer, Claude Montgomery, argued that the questions about the state’s protection of pensions should be dealt with in Federal District Court rather than in bankruptcy court.        
Judge Rhodes indicated that he believed the city could not afford to squander any time in its efforts to restore services and fix its finances. “If we put off the eligibility hearing, we delay the whole process,” he said.        
The second hearing concluded without a decision from the judge, who said he would rule on the issue within a few days.

John Sterling’s quarter-century of baritone bombast, mistakes, bizarrely creative home run calls and unalloyed joy at Yankees victories (“Thuuuuuh Yankees win!”) has made him an odd but solid part of the Yankees brand. A singular, divisive, much-debated personality, Sterling seems likely to move with the Yankees’ radio rights next season from WCBS-AM to WFAN, which will simulcast the games at 660 AM and 101.9 FM.        


If Sterling returns, with or without Suzyn Waldman, it will not be because he is a great broadcaster. He is frequently awful and laughable — yet unforgettable in his overblown way. His return would seem to be predicated on lengthy service as a Yankees homer. Longevity is a wonderful asset for a local baseball announcer. It helps build a fan base even if you’re not sublime. Had Bob Gamere lasted as a Yankees voice beyond his nearly forgotten season in 1970, he might have built a following.        
Sterling’s penchant for miscalling a play, or not describing action with absolute accuracy, is maddening and suggests a problem with his eyesight. On Tuesday in Toronto, he saw something that did not happen, or perhaps he called something he wished had happened.        
With R. A. Dickey pitching to Alex Rodriguez, Sterling said: “Swung on and drilled to deep-right-center field. That ball is high; it is far; it is gone! Over the wall.” He paused and then added, “Oh, it hit and kicked over.”        
But it had not gone over the wall. After another pause, he said: “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I got that call wrong. I got that all wrong. At the wall, Davis made the catch. Honestly, I didn’t think he made it. I thought he gave up on the ball. That’s why I thought it was out.”        
On the YES Network, Michael Kay said: “Driven out into right-center field. Davis back, and he’ll make the play for the second out.”        
On the Blue Jays’ radio broadcast, Jerry Howarth said: “Rodriguez lines one up the gap and into deep-right-center field. Moving back, Rajai Davis, and he makes a backhanded catch on the track.” There was no visual sign that Davis had given up on the ball.        
Kay and Howarth saw the routine play clearly. Sterling got it wrong in many ways and delayed correcting himself while exaggerating Davis’s nearness to the wall; he made the catch as he crossed onto the warning track. But at least he apologized.        
What Yankees management thinks of Sterling is not publicly known. Randy Levine, the team president, would not comment Thursday. Whether Levine and Hal Steinbrenner have combed through Sterling’s radio archive in the past before renewing his contracts is unknown, too. Perhaps management puts Sterling’s faux pas and nutty shtick (“An A-bomb, for A-Rod!”) in the category of Phil Rizzuto’s ignoring plays to send birthday wishes to fans or leaving early to beat the traffic home to New Jersey.        
Rizzuto was endearing and beloved, almost sweet. Sterling? Not so much. But is he eccentric? Oh my.        
On Aug. 8, 2012, he starred in another episode of Weird-but-True Yankees Classics.        
Casey McGehee led off the fourth inning against Detroit starter Anibal Sanchez.        
“Cuts and misses,” Sterling said. (No, the bat met the ball.) “No, he cuts and hits a fly ball down the left-field line, and the ball is foul.” (It was not a foul ball but a sharply hit ground ball.) “McGehee is headed toward second base as the throw comes in, and he’s staying at second.” (Sterling sounded a bit surprised, but McGehee had hit a ball that bounced fair over third base but landed foul.) “The ball went down the left-field line, and it must have hit it and kicked in the seats for a grounds-rule double.” (The ball did not kick into the stands, and it was not a ground-rule double.)        
A supportive partner, Waldman said, “We all missed it” — no other Tigers or Yankees announcers did — and added that the ball was “in the air; it flew over the bag.” There was no flying. Honest.        
The call was skewered the next morning by the WFAN hosts Craig Carton and Boomer Esiason; Carton ended their seven-minute analysis with a plea to the Yankees to sign Sterling and Waldman to a five-year deal. “I can’t live without them,” he said.        
He described their broadcasts as unique. He said they produced “the most colloquial broadcast ever” and would be missed if they were replaced by perfectly competent announcers who would not be idiosyncratic or memorable. Esiason and Carton had no reason to believe back then that they would ever share a station with the Yankees, and possibly Sterling.        
But next season, Carton, being Carton, will probably invite Sterling into the station’s studio to analyze Sterling.        
Imagine that: Carton and Sterling, belly to belly.

Three emergency medical technicians were arrested on Thursday and accused of stealing more than $325,000 from their nonprofit volunteer ambulance service in Queens, according to court documents filed by the state attorney general.        


The three men were all board members of the Corona Community Volunteer Ambulance Corps, an organization that covers not only the neighborhood but also events at Citi Field, according to an online description of its activities.        
The treasurer, Daniel Dominguez, 37, is accused of stealing more than $300,000 and using the money to pay for trips to Disney World and Niagara Falls, among other purchases. Daryl Adeva, 31, and David Moretti, 41, are accused of stealing smaller amounts.        
All three were arraigned on grand larceny charges in Queens County Criminal Court.        
The ambulance corps had no immediate comment, and a phone number listed for their lawyers was not answered on Thursday evening.        
In a statement, the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said, “These emergency medical technicians, who were entrusted with providing medical services and transportation for New York residents, instead took advantage of their positions and used a not-for-profit ambulance corps as their own personal piggy bank.”

The Obama administration has decided to revive a controversial loan guarantee program at the Energy Department, administration officials said on Thursday, even as the program remains under Congressional scrutiny after losing hundreds of millions in taxpayer money on investments in failed green energy start-ups like the solar module maker Solyndra.         
This time, though, the program would devote as much as $8 billion to helping industries like coal and oil make cleaner energy. Although the program, which does not require Congressional approval, would support a wide range of technologies, it could help coal-fired power plants find a way to keep their emissions from escaping into the atmosphere, department officials said.        
Officials say the federal subsidies are necessary to support the development of technologies that are too complex, unproven and expensive for investors and private companies to pursue on their own, assertions that have already stirred criticism from opponents who see the program as too risky and a misuse of taxpayer money.        
The program’s renewal comes just as the administration is releasing stringent environmental rules that would severely restrict air pollution at new coal plants.        
“We have a real problem, and that’s, ‘How do we get new technology to market?’ ” said Peter W. Davidson, executive director of the loan program office at the Energy Department. “We partner with industry developers and entrepreneurs to demonstrate a new technology at industrial scale or utility scale, and hopefully once that technology is proven by deployment at scale, we step out of the way,” and let the private debt markets take over.        
A spokeswoman for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which is controlled by Republicans, who have been critical of the loans in the past, took a skeptical view of the program.        
“The D.O.E. loan guarantee program’s history of mismanagement, bankruptcies and failure to deliver the jobs promised raises significant concerns about risking billions in additional taxpayer dollars,” Charlotte Baker said. “We are supportive of efforts to encourage the development of advanced fossil fuel technologies, but we are skeptical that federal loan guarantees are the best way” to bring this about.        
Analysts and climate experts also questioned whether the program, which was originally established in 2005 and whose new guidelines will be completed this fall, could make the technologies economically viable on a mass scale. There are currently no ventures in the United States that achieve this, despite years of government-sponsored research and development, according to the Congressional Research Service. An ambitious clean-coal demonstration project called FutureGen, proposed by President George W. Bush in 2003, has yet to advance beyond the early development stages.        
“It seems sound policy for the administration to provide these loan guarantees,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former energy aide in the Clinton White House who is now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. “The real question becomes, ‘Is that adequate to actually prompt significant numbers of new builds?’ and I think that the answer so far is no.”        
The Energy Department’s loan program was created in 2005 under President Bush to spur commercial adoption of innovative technologies or those that avoided, reduced or permanently stored pollutants. In 2008, Congress added another section, for more fuel-efficient cars, and a year later created a temporary program to encourage renewable energy and electrical transmission projects.        
That temporary program, which was responsible for the Solyndra loan, has since expired, but the department still has about $50 billion left that could be lent, with a large chunk earmarked for nuclear projects.        
The department points to several successful investments from the loan program. Ernest J. Moniz, the energy secretary, has pointed to Tesla Motors’ early repayment of $465 million as an example. Mr. Davidson said that since his office financed the first six large-scale photovoltaic solar farms in 2010 and 2011, 10 big solar power plants had started or finished construction without any federal money. On a $34 billion loan portfolio, the government has lost about $800 million, he said. That’s about 2.3 percent, and only a small fraction of the $10 billion Congress set aside to cover losses.

In the sandy brick gymnasium at Abraham Lincoln High School, in Coney Island in Brooklyn, foldout chairs were laid out, and a podium was in place for an announcement by yet another basketball prodigy who had decided to leave home.        


There were blue and white balloons and streamers hanging from the lofted indoor track. “I Made It” by the rapper Kevin Rudolf blared on the sound system. A neon orange banner sent congratulations to Isaiah Whitehead, considered the top player in New York City.        
“It’s like déjà vu,” said Dwayne Morton, Lincoln’s coach.        
Like Stephon Marbury, Sebastian Telfair and Lance Stephenson, three Lincoln stars before him, Whitehead chose to remove himself from New York City entirely — although Whitehead is not going far away. Quietly, if not timidly, he revealed that he would commit to Seton Hall, in South Orange, N.J.        
“I want to set my own path,” Whitehead said.        
The 12th-best prospect in the country, according to Scout.com, Whitehead had whittled his choices to Indiana, Pittsburgh, Minnesota, Seton Hall and St. John’s. A 6-foot-4 shooting guard, Whitehead said he came to the conclusion Wednesday night after an unofficial visit that day to the St. John’s campus.        
“I picked Seton Hall to bring the program back to where it used to be,” said Whitehead, who led Lincoln to the city championship this spring.        
It took only seconds before another neon orange banner was unfurled behind him as he spoke, this one spelling out, “Seton Hall.” Royal blue Pirates T-shirts were dispersed to Whitehead’s teammates, and the cheerleading squad performed a jubilant routine.        
Whitehead’s mother, Ericka Rambert, dabbed away tears.        
“Up until last night, St. John’s was up in his mind,” Rambert said. “Everybody was telling him, ‘New York City, New York City, New York City.’        
“But I think sometimes you’ve got to get a little bit away from home,” Rambert added. “He needed to be someplace where he’s going to be close to me, but he can’t just get up and get on the train and go to the house.”        
For months, Whitehead seemed destined for a place like Syracuse, Louisville, Arizona or U.C.L.A., top-flight programs that had all expressed sincere interest in him. Over the summer, that interest appeared to wane. St. John’s met with Whitehead in April, but the Red Storm, already with six scholarship guards on its roster, had begun focusing its recruiting efforts elsewhere.        
According to a person with knowledge of Whitehead’s recruitment, St. John’s would not offer Whitehead a guaranteed starting spot. Perhaps just as important, St. John’s would not offer Morton a spot on its coaching staff.        
Morton, a longtime city basketball power broker, did not exactly refute the reports that he would soon be joining Seton Hall’s bench, if not this season then next. He reiterated his desire to coach in college.        
“Tristate area is my strength,” Morton said, “so help me out.”        
Morton acknowledged his heavy influence in Whitehead’s recruitment. He said that Seton Hall had been quietly there all along and that, despite not making the N.C.A.A. tournament since 2006, the Pirates provided a blank slate for Whitehead to flourish.        
Blue and white streamers fell from the ceiling, covering the audience, including the girls’ volleyball team, which was trying to clear the court so it could practice. Then the cheerleaders began to clap and chant, and the noise interrupted Morton’s impromptu news conference. He used the diversion to slip away, walking toward the back of the gym, behind the scenes.

WASHINGTON — Those in the circle of fiery House conservatives who are spearheading a fiscal showdown that threatens to shut down the government see themselves in vaunted company.        


“It only takes one with passion — look at Rosa Parks, Lech Walesa, Martin Luther King,” said Representative Ted Yoho of Florida, one of the rank-and-file House Republicans who have risen up to challenge their party’s leadership over whether to confront the Senate and President Obama with their demands to cut off funding for the president’s health care law. “People with passion that speak up, they’ll have people follow them because they believe the same way, and smart leadership listens to that.”        
Along with Mr. Yoho, a rotating cast of characters — often backbench newcomers whom few have heard of outside their districts, and who were elected on a Tea Party wave — has emerged to challenge Speaker John A. Boehner’s leadership at every turn.        
Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, a libertarian-leaning sophomore Republican, led the revolt against the National Security Agency’s domestic surveillance programs, which Mr. Boehner had strongly endorsed. Representative Scott Rigell, Republican of Virginia, complicated his leadership’s support for the use of force in Syria when he drafted a letter demanding that the president first consult Congress.        
And on the current fiscal fight over financing the government, it was Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia, who amassed 80 House supporters, enough to force his party’s leadership to tie the money needed to keep the government running after the end of this month to defunding the president’s signature health care law. Representative Thomas Massie, a freshman Republican from Kentucky elected with the help of Ron Paul supporters, had the temerity last week to question his leadership’s initial proposal, calling it a “hocus-pocus” gimmick that would have allowed the Senate to easily strip out the language defunding the president’s health care plan before sending Mr. Obama a clean financing bill.        
The House is to vote Friday on the funding plan. In advance of the vote and the clash to come with the Senate, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, a chief advocate of tying government funding to the health law, on Thursday thanked Mr. Graves and House conservatives in general — “for sticking their neck out.”        
Maverick Republicans have taken on the leadership on other issues as well. In January, Representative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas, helped lead a failed attempt to remove Mr. Boehner as speaker, and Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, became an outspoken critic of any attempt to overhaul immigration laws — a priority for Mr. Boehner. Even the farm bill, with decades of bipartisan camaraderie behind it, fell to an emboldened Tea Party wing, this time led by Representative Marlin Stutzman, an Indiana Republican who demanded that the broad agriculture measure be stripped of its food-stamp provision, which has been part of the law since 1973.        
“In the multitude of counselors, there is wisdom,” said Representative Mark Meadows, a freshman Republican from North Carolina.        
This unruly and highly vocal group of conservative legislators has been empowered in the escalating fight by the fact that Republicans hold only a narrow majority in the House; depending on the issue, this core conservative wing can either be persuaded to vote with their party, or they can muster up enough of a coalition to block any legislation with which they do not fully agree.        
The decision by the House leadership to mollify the most conservative members of its conference on the latest fiscal fight has created both tension between Tea Party members in the House and the Senate, and underscored the challenges Mr. Boehner faces this year from his party’s more conservative and libertarian wing.        
“We’ve got a diverse caucus, frankly,” Mr. Boehner said, when asked at a news conference Thursday who, exactly, was running his conference. “Republicans, by their very nature, are a bit more independent than our colleagues across the aisle.”        
Mr. Boehner added: “And so whenever we’re trying to put together a plan, you know, we’ve got 233 members, all of whom have their own plan. It’s tough to get them on the same track.”        
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, did not mince words Thursday in calling the group a bunch of “legislative arsonists” who had “hijacked” the Republican Party.

ALTON, Iowa — The puny, yellow corn stalks stand like weary sentries on one boundary of Dennis Von Arb’s field here.        


On a windy day this spring, his neighbor sprayed glyphosate on his fields, and some of the herbicide blew onto Mr. Von Arb’s conventionally grown corn, killing the first few rows.        
He’s more concerned, though, about the soil. During heavy rains in the summer, the runoff from his neighbor’s farm soaked his fields with glyphosate-laden water.        
“Anything you put on the land affects the chemistry and biology of the land, and that’s a powerful pesticide,” Mr. Von Arb said.        
But 20 miles down the road, Brad Vermeer brushes aside such concerns.        
He grows “traited,” or biotech, corn and soy on some 1,500 acres and estimates that his yield would fall by 20 percent if he switched to conventional crops and stopped using glyphosate, known by brand names like Roundup and Buccaneer.        
In short, it is just too profitable to give up.        
“Local agronomists are starting to say we have to get away from Roundup,” Mr. Vermeer said. “But they’re going to have to show me that conventional genetics can produce the same income.”        
The local differences over glyphosate are feeding the long-running debate over biotech crops, which currently account for roughly 90 percent of the corn, soybeans and sugar beets grown in the United States.        
While regulators and many scientists say biotech crops are no different from their conventional cousins, others worry that they are damaging the environment and human health. The battle is being waged at the polls, with ballot initiatives to require labeling of genetically modified foods; in courtrooms, where lawyers want to undo patents on biotech seeds; and on supermarket shelves containing products promoting conventionally grown ingredients.        
Now, some farmers are taking a closer look at their soil.        
First patented by Monsanto as a herbicide in 1974, glyphosate has helped revolutionize farming by making it easier and cheaper to grow crops. The use of the herbicide has grown exponentially, along with biotech crops.        
The pervasive use, though, is prompting some concerns.        
Critics point, in part, to the rise of so-called superweeds, which are more resistant to the herbicide. To fight them, farmers sometimes have to spray the toxic herbicide two to three times during the growing season.        
Then there is the feel of the soil.        
Dirt in two fields around Alton where biotech corn was being grown was hard and compact. Prying corn stalks from the soil with a shovel was difficult, and when the plants finally came up, their roots were trapped in a chunk of dirt. Once freed, the roots spread out flat like a fan and were studded with only a few nodules, which are critical to the exchange of nutrients.        
In comparison, conventional corn in adjacent fields could be tugged from the ground by hand, and dirt with the consistency of wet coffee grounds fell off the corn plants’ knobby roots.        
“Because glyphosate moves into the soil from the plant, it seems to affect the rhizosphere, the ecology around the root zone, which in turn can affect plant health,” said Robert Kremer, a scientist at the United States Agriculture Department, who has studied the impact of glyphosate on soybeans for more than a decade and has warned of the herbicide’s impact on soil health.        
Like the human microbiome, the plants’ roots systems rely on a complex system of bacteria, fungi and minerals in the soil. The combination, in the right balance, helps protect the crops from diseases and improves photosynthesis.        
In some studies, scientists have found that a big selling point for the pesticide — that it binds tightly to minerals in the soil, like calcium, boron and manganese, thus preventing runoff — also means it competes with plants for those nutrients. Other research indicates that glyphosate can alter the mix of bacteria and fungi that interact with plant root systems, making them more susceptible to parasites and pathogens.        
“Antibiotics kill bacteria or reduce their growth, but some of those bacteria are useful,” said Verlyn Sneller, president of Verity, a small company that sells sugar-based fertilizers and water systems and works to persuade farmers like Mr. Vermeer to switch to conventional crops.        
But research detailing the adverse effects with glyphosate is limited, and other studies counter such findings.        
Monsanto, which sells Roundup and seeds resistant to glyphosate, says “there is no credible evidence” that the herbicide “causes extended adverse effects to microbial processes in soil.” A team of scientists from the Agriculture Department similarly reviewed much of the research and found the herbicide to be fairly benign. In response to a request from Monsanto, the Environmental Protection Agency recently increased the amount of glyphosate that is allowed on food and feed crops.

Deron Williams was not deemed healthy enough to play dodgeball Thursday, but he still expects to be on the court Oct. 1, when the Nets begin training camp.        


Williams, who sprained his right ankle about two weeks ago, was wearing a walking boot at the dodgeball tournament he hosted in Manhattan for his foundation, Point of Hope, which benefits autism research. He said his ankle was sore and inflamed, but he called the boot a precautionary measure.        
“They have me in it now so I don’t have to worry about it when the season starts,” Williams said.        
Williams worked out for a few days after sustaining the injury, but the pain lingered, so he had a magnetic resonance imaging test. Williams, who battled pain in both ankles for much of last season, said the Nets were being extra careful.        
“It’s frustrating because I wanted to be hooping with the guys right now,” he said.        
Williams said he expected to have the boot off by next week, after a follow-up examination.        
Williams and the Nets are looking to jell early after adding several new faces. Several players worked out together this summer in Los Angeles, and most of the team members have already arrived in the New York and New Jersey area to get ready for the season.        
“The best part is probably us sitting in the locker room, talking and getting to know one another,” said Paul Pierce, who was traded to the Nets by the Boston Celtics in the off-season. “That’s how you build chemistry.”        
Pierce has shown a willingness to engage in spirited interborough banter. He was asked Thursday about Knicks guard J. R. Smith, who called Pierce “a bitter person” after Pierce was quoted as saying the Nets would be the city’s pre-eminent team.        
“Who?” Pierce said. “Who we talking about right now? Exactly. Who we talking about? We talking about nothing.”

WASHINGTON — A year after a plan by President Obama to limit greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants set off angry opposition, the administration will announce on Friday that it is not backing down from a confrontation with the coal industry and will press ahead with enacting the first federal carbon limits on the nation’s power companies.        


The proposed regulations, to be announced at the National Press Club by Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, are an aggressive move by Mr. Obama to bypass Congress on climate change with executive actions he promised in his inaugural address this year. The regulations are certain to be denounced by House Republicans and the industry as part of what they call the president’s “war on coal.”        
In her speech, Ms. McCarthy will unveil the agency’s proposal to limit new gas-fired power plants to 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt hour and new coal plants to 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide, according to administration officials who were briefed on the agency’s plans. Industry officials say the average advanced coal plant currently emits about 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour.        
“New power plants, both natural gas and coal-fired, can minimize their carbon emissions by taking advantage of modern technologies,” Ms. McCarthy will say Friday, according to her prepared remarks. “Simply put, these standards represent the cleanest standards we’ve put forth for new natural gas plants and new coal plants.”        
Aides said Ms. McCarthy would also announce a yearlong schedule for an environmental listening tour — a series of meetings across the country with the public, the industry and environmental groups as the agency works to establish emissions limits on existing power plants — a far more costly and controversial step. Mr. Obama has told officials he wants to see greenhouse gas limits on both existing and new power plants by the time he leaves office in 2017.        
“We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,” Mr. Obama said in January. But he acknowledged that “the path toward sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult.”        
The limits to be unveiled Friday are a slightly more relaxed standard for coal plants than the administration first proposed in April 2012. Officials said the new plan, which came after the E.P.A. received more than 2.5 million comments from the public and industry, will give coal plant operators more flexibility to meet the limits over several years.        
Still, environmental groups are likely to hail the announcement as an important step in targeting the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. Forty percent of all energy-related emissions of greenhouse gases in 2012 came from power plants, and most of that came from coal-burning power plants, according to the Energy Information Administration.        
“We are thrilled that the E.P.A. is taking this major step forward in implementing President Obama’s climate action plan,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, a senior vice president at the League of Conservation Voters, in anticipation of Ms. McCarthy’s announcement. “It’s a great day for public heath and a clean energy future.”        
But Republican lawmakers and industry officials have already attacked the expected proposal. Opponents of the new rules argue that the technology to affordably reduce carbon emissions at power plants is not yet available and will drastically increase the cost of electricity.        
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader and a fierce advocate for coal in a coal-dependent state, said in an interview Thursday that he expected “the worst.” Although he had not seen the administration’s latest proposal, Mr. McConnell said it was likely to alarm people in his state.        
“It’s a devastating blow to our state, and we’re going to fight it in every way we can,” Mr. McConnell said.        
Scott Segal, the director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, which represents power companies, said the details he had heard about the rules suggested that the administration would drive investment away from a plentiful source of power.        
“I’m afraid it’s going to be illegal, counterproductive from an environmental perspective and contrary to our long-range interest in creating jobs, holding down costs and producing reliable energy,” Mr. Segal said.        
The rules on new power plants will soon face a 60-day public comment period, likely to be followed by intensive industry and environmental lobbying and possible court challenges. Officials said the rules could be finalized by the fall of 2014.        
Once the rules are in place, coal power plants would be required to limit their emissions, likely by installing technology called “carbon capture and sequestration,” which scrubs carbon dioxide from their emissions before they reach the plant smokestacks. The technology then pumps it into permanent storage underground.        
Industry representatives argue that such technology has not been proven on a large scale and would be extraordinarily expensive — and therefore in violation of provisions in the Clean Air Act that require the regulations to be adequately demonstrated and not exorbitant in cost.        
“I think the agency has real problems” meeting both of those standards, Mr. Segal said.        
But E.P.A. officials argue that the carbon capture technology has been used in several locations and that a review of the industry over the past year proves that owners of new coal-fired power plants can meet the new standards as required by the act.        
Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement that the proposed rules would begin a new era in which the United States began real efforts to control “climate-altering pollution” from the nation’s power plants.        
“These rules are reasonable,” Mr. Markey said. “They are feasible. And they should soon be expanded to include standards for existing power plants.”        
In one concession to the industry, officials said the agency would provide some flexibility. Plants that could install the technology within 12 months would be required to meet the 1,100-pound limit, officials said. Owners of coal plants would also have the option of phasing in the limits over a seven-year period, officials said. But those plants would be required to meet a stricter standard of 1,000 to 1,050 pounds per megawatt hours, averaged over the seven years.        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 21, 2013An article on Friday about the Obama administration’s plans to enact the first federal carbon limits on the nation’s power companies referred incorrectly to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from the average advanced coal plant. It is 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour, not per hour.

TORONTO — There may be some complex equations and intricate algorithms that prove the Yankees still have a mathematical chance to reach the playoffs. But the visible evidence tells a different story.        


Needing a win to keep up their momentum from an emotional victory the night before, the Yankees instead endured a 6-2 loss to the last-place Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday night at Rogers Centre that left them three and a half games behind the Texas Rangers and the Tampa Bay Rays for one of the two wild-card spots in the American League. There are also three other wild-card contenders ahead of the Yankees, who have only nine games remaining.        
For the Yankees to make the playoffs, it would require a collapse of historic proportions from multiple teams, and that is what they are banking on.        
“As long as we’re not mathematically out of it, we’ve still got a chance,” outfielder Vernon Wells said. “There’s not a person in this room that feels any differently.”        
But as third baseman Mark Reynolds put it, “it’s pretty desperate.”        
With injuries and exhaustion bearing down on them, the Yankees concluded their three-city, 11-day trip with a 4-6 record. They won three of four in Baltimore and went into Friday’s game at Boston one game out of a playoff spot. But they lost all three games at Fenway Park in humiliating fashion, and five of the last six on the trip.        
“We ran into the Red Sox wave, and we haven’t recovered,” Alex Rodriguez said. “But tomorrow is a good time to get on our home field and play some good baseball.”        
Good baseball is not something the Yankees have played since their charter jet left Baltimore last week, aside from the eighth inning Wednesday, when they rallied for four runs.        
The offense, which managed only five hits Thursday, has been stagnant, and fatigue seems to be affecting nearly everyone. That includes Joba Chamberlain, who gave up a three-run homer to Adam Lind in the seventh inning that put Thursday’s game out of reach.        
“It was a tough road trip,” Alfonso Soriano said. “You can blame it on that. We got tired. We go home tonight, and we have six very important games at home.”        
Hiroki Kuroda started and had runners on base throughout his six innings of work.        
Curtis Granderson hit a home run in the sixth that closed the Yankees’ deficit to 2-1, but Kuroda gave up a home run to Anthony Gose in the bottom of the inning that put the Blue Jays ahead by 3-1.        
With the Yankees trailing by two runs in the seventh, Manager Joe Girardi summoned Chamberlain, who has been used primarily in mop-up situations in the second half of the season. In this case, the game was still competitive, and the season may have been hanging in the balance.        
Chamberlain promptly gave up a leadoff walk, a single and the home run to Lind.        
Girardi explained that he did not want to use David Robertson, if possible. He had the left-hander Cesar Cabral warming up before Lind’s at-bat but decided to go with the more experienced option in Chamberlain.        
“He’s been throwing the ball pretty well,” Girardi said. “But he didn’t do it tonight.”        
The Yankees did not score until Granderson hit his home run in the sixth, attacking a 1-2 fastball that was up in the zone and driving it into the seats in right field for his seventh home run. Rodriguez followed him and tapped out to short, making him 1 for 19 since the end of the series against the Orioles on Sept. 12.        
The Yankees put together a modest rally in the ninth to score one run, but it was far too late. The decisive blow of the game, and perhaps the season, had already been struck by Lind, leaving the Yankees to reflect on what permutations of their victories and their opponents’ losses would get them into the postseason.        
The Yankees have six games left at home — three against the San Francisco Giants, beginning Friday, and then three against the Rays. The Yankees must also hope that the Cleveland Indians, the Baltimore Orioles and the Kansas City Royals all lose.        
Reynolds said the Yankees had to “run the table.” Soriano said they could secure a playoff berth by winning eight of nine, or even seven of nine, depending on what the other teams did.        
Shortstop Brendan Ryan, who had been watching the other relevant games on his iPhone at his locker after the game against the Blue Jays, cursed when he saw that the Indians had beaten the Houston Astros in 11 innings. It was another game that did not go the Yankees’ way Thursday, making the math even more difficult.        
“It’s not a time to reflect,” Rodriguez said. “It’s a time to win games.”        
INSIDE PITCH        
ALEX RODRIGUEZ, recovering from hamstring and calf strains, took some fielding practice Thursday and said he hoped he would play third base before the season ended. ... ANDY PETTITTE said he preferred not to discuss his upcoming deposition for BRIAN McNAMEE’s civil suit against ROGER CLEMENS.

EDINA, Minn. — The 95-degree heat on a late August day made Josh Harding hasten from his Cadillac Escalade pickup truck into an air-conditioned coffee shop. A few minutes after buying a lemonade, Harding — in a white T-shirt, dark blue shorts, flip-flops and a backward Minnesota Twins ball cap — felt so cold he grasped his shoulders for warmth.        


But Harding did not seem to mind. Oppressive heat can be problematic for people with multiple sclerosis. Keeping cool and hydrated is an everyday concern for Harding, the Minnesota Wild goalie who was found to have the inflammatory disease last year during the N.H.L. lockout. Harding took the diagnosis so seriously he even gave up golf.        
“It’s good,” Harding, 28, said. “I need to be chilly. This is perfect.”        
Harding missed most of last season as he adjusted to his medication and its side effects. He returned in the playoffs to fill in for the injured Niklas Backstrom, posting a .911 save percentage and a 2.94 goals against average in a five-game, first-round loss to the Chicago Blackhawks, the eventual Stanley Cup champions.        
Awarded the N.H.L.’s Bill Masterton Trophy for perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey, Harding spent the off-season establishing Harding’s Hope, a charity benefiting multiple sclerosis patients struggling to afford medication and treatment. Harding said he was aghast to learn that a year’s supply of M.S. drugs cost $60,000 to $70,000. His N.H.L. health insurance picks up most of the costs, but Harding knows not everyone is so lucky.        
“I was kind of seeing what needed the most help,” Harding said. “I sat down and talked to doctors, everybody involved in the charity. The best thing is to help people living with it right now, with their day-to-day lives. I feel very fortunate being in the N.H.L., being covered with insurance, all the resources are covered, too. I just wanted to help out people living with it right now.”        
Last week, Harding was back on the ice for the opening of the Wild’s training camp. In a white mask with his nickname, Hards, on the chin, Harding appeared no different from the other four goalies at the University of Minnesota’s Ridder Arena. His only visible concession to M.S. was a second water bottle atop his goal.        
Harding said he must be careful to avoid overheating, excessive fatigue and stress. Unfortunately, all are part of a goalie’s job description. Although Harding’s playoff return alleviated some of the team’s concerns, Wild Coach Mike Yeo said he still had to determine how often Harding could play as Backstrom’s backup. Backstrom, who turns 36 in February, appeared to wear down as the lockout-shortened season went along.        
“We can’t sit here and draw up a blueprint for it right now,” Yeo said. “There have been other years where we put a pretty set plan in place. This is a unique situation with both guys where we have to evaluate it on a day-in-and-day-out basis and be prepared to adjust.”        
Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable disease that attacks the central nervous system. Symptoms and severity vary from person to person, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Web site, and most people do not become severely disabled. There is no cure, but symptoms often can be controlled with medication.        
Harding said he received his diagnosis after collapsing last October during an informal workout with locked-out N.H.L. players in St. Louis Park, a Minneapolis suburb.        
Several weeks before, Harding had complained of extreme fatigue and neck pain. On the ice that day, he said he saw dots that grew bigger and bigger until they blocked out the puck. Then his right leg went numb and gave out.        
“Obviously, I knew something was wrong,” he said. “It stayed like that just for a little bit, but I had enough to get up. It felt like I was walking on nails. Thankfully, we had three goalies there. I had to come off the ice, and I just left.”        
Magnetic resonance imaging tests of his neck and brain showed lesions, telltale signs of M.S. The Wild’s team physician, Dan Peterson, who is also Harding’s family doctor, referred Harding to Dr. Jonathan Calkwood, one of Minnesota’s leading M.S. specialists.        
The diagnosis shook Harding. It came four months after he signed a three-year, $5.7 million contract extension and shortly after he learned his fiancée was pregnant.        
“Right when the doctor said multiple sclerosis, I was worried for sure,” he said. “I think anybody would be. I didn’t know if it was going to be career-ending. I had so many questions.”        
Calkwood told Harding that with a proper diet, rest and medication, he could continue his career. Harding later heard from Jordan Sigalet, a former minor league goalie who played four professional seasons with M.S. and appeared briefly for the Boston Bruins in 2006.        
“When you think about M.S., the main thing is not to be overheated and not to be stressed,” Sigalet said in a telephone interview earlier this year. “When you think about a goalie, it’s probably the worst for all those things. People always think, you’re in an ice rink, it’s cold out there. But you have 50 pounds of equipment on.”        
Sigalet said he often received intravenous fluids between periods as a precaution. Harding would not address that but said he was willing to do whatever was necessary.        
“I’m lucky to be a Minnesota Wild,” Harding said. “Now it’s my job to do everything in my power to not make them regret taking me back.”        
It helps that Harding is expected to be a backup, not the No. 1 goalie. Harding insisted he could play as well as he used to.        
“No one knows except Josh how he’s feeling or what his day-to-day life is like,” his teammate Zach Parise said. “For us, you can only hope we can rely on him when we need to, and he can step in and play big games when we need him to.”

A federal judge in Brooklyn has rejected a request by prosecutors to sequester a jury in a murder and racketeering trial, citing the impact that federal budget cuts are having on the judiciary.        


The judge, Sterling Johnson Jr., acknowledged in an order on Wednesday that the jurors in the case would benefit from protection, noting that he would keep their identities secret. But the judge said he would not take additional measures to sequester them because “the court must also be mindful of today’s economic climate.”        
Judge Johnson wrote in a 10-page decision that for most, the budget reductions, known as sequestration, have “forced cuts to the bone,” but that for the judiciary, “sequestration has forced cuts to the marrow.”        
The unusual ruling came in the case of Laron Spicer, a Brooklyn man who is accused of leading the Nine-Trey Gangsters, a set of the Bloods street gang that for 12 years ran a drug empire from four apartment buildings that they controlled in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Prosecutors said Mr. Spicer and others committed shootings, knife attacks and other acts of violence to protect their turf. They are charged with luring a rival drug dealer into the street in July 2008 and shooting him to death.        
And of particular concern to prosecutors, Mr. Spicer has a prior conviction for witness tampering, once threatening to kill a police officer in a hallway of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.        
“During the encounter, the officer asked Spicer, ‘Are you going to kill me?’ ” prosecutors wrote in their motion for sequestering the jury. “Spicer replied, ‘I’ll have someone else do it for me.’ ”        
And while Mr. Spicer has been held pending trial, he is accused of ordering the beating of a co-defendant because of suspicions that he had been cooperating with the authorities, prosecutors said.        
Mr. Spicer is scheduled to go to trial on Nov. 4, along with others suspected to be members of the gang, James Dotwin and Jamar Williams. Mr. Spicer faces life in prison if convicted.        
With his ruling, Judge Johnson, who said he could not comment about a pending matter before him, created his own solution to the tightening judicial budgets that have caused alarm among judges across the country.        
Last month, the chief judges of 87 federal district courts wrote to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to express concern over the impact of flat financing for the past few years, followed by nearly $350 million in sequestration cuts that went into effect on March 1. The judges said staffing cuts among clerks, probation officers and federal public defenders were putting public safety at risk and slowing the justice system.        
Carol Bagley Amon, the chief judge of the Eastern District of New York and Judge Johnson’s colleague on the bench, was among those who signed the letter. Judge Amon said on Thursday that she had just returned from the Judicial Conference of the United States, and “what was foremost on the minds of the judges was the budget crisis.”        
While Judge Johnson’s efforts appear unique, other cost-cutting measures have been employed.        
Peter Kirchheimer, the lawyer in charge of federal public defenders in Brooklyn, whose agency has received some of the deepest cuts, recalled two cases in which his agency could not afford to pay expert witnesses, so judges appointed private lawyers to help with the cases, because they have faced fewer budget cuts. “In the end, we’ll pay double,” Mr. Kirchheimer said. “It’s an insane way to do business.”

New York City is a big dance town. Flash mobs gather in Grand Central Terminal, and there is break dancing in Washington Square Park, hypnotic house dancing on the club circuit and the worldwide sensation with the local name — Harlem Shake.        


But square dancing?        
“Why not?” asked Daniel A. Biederman, the urban parks expert who, as executive director of the Bryant Park Corporation, has invited the public to promenade and do-si-do on the one-acre lawn wedged between skyscrapers in Midtown. “I’ve always loved square dancing. I’ve done it in different parts of the country and I’ve always noticed that people are smiling and having a good time.”        
On Friday evening, a caller will lead the second of three square dances in Bryant Park this month. The first, on Sept. 9, attracted 760 dancers, far more than the dances held last year, the first time they were offered. What those swinging their partners may not realize is that they are revitalizing a dance form that was, improbably, a rage in postwar New York.        
In the summer of 1948 alone, some 250,000 people joined a series of square dances that were held by the city’s parks department in Central Park and Riverside Park in Manhattan and in Prospect Park in Brooklyn. The silver-tongued Ed Durlacher, a New York native and one of the leading callers of his day, was known to draw up to 10,000 dancers to a single event. “The nation was swept up in something of a square dancing craze,” said Michael Miscione, the Manhattan borough historian. “New York City caught the bug, too.”        
A 1949 article in The New York Times, under the headline “Big City Parks ‘Go Small Town’ at Parks’ Great Dancing Parties,” described one such dance in Central Park where women wore “wide swing skirts and blouses” and men “scarlet neckerchiefs.” Mr. Durlacher, the leader of the band Top Hands, told the 1,500 people in attendance to form squares. “His simple instruction,” the article noted, “was interlarded with bits of salty humor.”        
At the dance in Bryant Park earlier this month, Pat Cannon, a modern-day caller, warmed up the crowd by having them form a giant circle around the lawn. Members of the park’s staff helped those who had come stag to find partners. “It was very beautiful,” she said. “I asked them to look their partners in the eye, wave to them and say howdy. How many times can you do that with New Yorkers?”        
Ms. Cannon, who runs Foot and Fiddle Dance Company, was impressed by the agility of the participants, especially compared with those at some of the stiffer corporate events she works. “It was a sophisticated audience,” she said. “They were there specifically to dance. I was able to do some more complicated things and there was a great sense of rhythm. There was even a square dance caller from Germany who was in town on holiday.”        
When Ms. Cannon arrived in the city the 1970s, the square dance mania of the 1940s had long faded. Still, she found other devotees at places like the Eagle Tavern on 14th Street and later at South Street Seaport. “There were pockets of square dancing even then,” she said.        
The final dance in Bryant Park, scheduled for Wednesday, is likely to include Carol Stern, who, as the granddaughter of Mr. Durlacher, is square dance royalty. “I plan to go,” said Ms. Stern, who lives on Long Island and remembers joining her grandfather’s square dances at Jones Beach as a child. (A newsreel of Mr. Durlacher calling a dance in Central Park is at squaredancehistory.org/items/show/145.)        
Although Mr. Durlacher died in 1964, his enthusiasm for square dancing lives on. Ms. Stern is president of Educational Activities in Freeport, on Long Island, which grew out of a company called Square Dance Associates that Mr. Durlacher founded; it now sells fitness and dance recordings, including those of her grandfather.        
“He was evangelical about square dancing,” Ms. Stern said. “He believed it would help kids by giving them purpose and focus.”

The Los Angeles Dodgers soaked everyone in sight with Champagne in the clubhouse. Many players raced back out for a celebratory dip in the swimming pool at Arizona’s Chase Field. After going from last place to an National League West title in less than three months, they let loose.        


Burdened by high expectations and a horrible start, the Dodgers relieved their pent-up pressure with a joyful celebration after becoming the first team this year to clinch a playoff spot. Hanley Ramirez homered twice as they rallied to beat the Diamondbacks, 7-6, on Thursday.        
“I want to keep going,” Ramirez said. “I think that we’ve got a couple of more steps to do. We’ve got to keep working and stay together all the way through to the end.”        
Ramirez was back in the lineup after being sidelined five of six games with an irritated nerve in his lower back. He has played 1,090 regular-season games but will be making his first trip to the postseason.        
Despite an N.L.-high payroll of $214 million-plus on opening day, the Dodgers got off to an 30-42 start and were last in the division, nine and a half games behind the first-place Diamondbacks, before play June 22. Los Angeles has gone 58-23 since, including a 42-8 run that mostly coincided with the call-up of the dynamic Cuban defector Yasiel Puig.        
RED SOX 3, ORIOLES 1 Boston clinched its first postseason berth since 2009, beating Baltimore behind John Lackey’s two-hitter. The host Red Sox lowered their magic number to two for clinching the American League East. Boston scored all its runs in the second on Stephen Drew’s two-run homer and Dustin Pedroia’s run-scoring single.        
RANGERS 8, RAYS 2 Elvis Andrus drove in three runs, and Texas beat Tampa Bay for a four-game series split that left the teams tied atop the A.L. wild-card race. Mitch Moreland, Andrus and Alex Rios each homered off Matt Moore in the third to put the visiting Rangers ahead to stay.        
INDIANS 2, ASTROS 1 Matt Carson hit a winning single with two outs in the 11th, and Cleveland beat visiting Houston to close within a half-game in the A.L. wild-card race.        
ROCKIES 7, CARDINALS 6 Corey Dickerson’s run-scoring triple with one out in the bottom of the 15th inning gave Colorado a home victory over St. Louis. Matt Holliday had three hits for the Cardinals, who had their N.L. Central Division lead over Pittsburgh trimmed to one game.        
PIRATES 10, PADRES 1 Neil Walker had four hits, including his 11th homer, and drove in three runs as Pittsburgh won at home against San Diego to stop a three-game losing streak. Pedro Alvarez hit his N.L.-leading 34th homer for Pittsburgh.        
NATIONALS 3, MARLINS 2 Bryce Harper hit a three-run homer to back an effective pitching performance by Gio Gonzalez, and host Washington kept alive its slim hopes of reaching the playoffs.

Cornell canceled all fall competitions for its men’s lacrosse team Thursday for what the university described as “a team hazing incident.” Cornell penalized the team as a whole, not individual players, it said in a news release.         
The university said it had investigated the incident after the team was placed on temporary suspension last week, but a spokesman declined to comment further or make any men’s lacrosse coaches or athletic administrators available. The team is allowed to train and practice, according to the news release, but will not play any games or tournaments this fall.        
The Big Red finished 14-4 last season and advanced to the national semifinals, where they lost to Duke, the eventual national champion. Cornell’s first fall contest, an exhibition against the Iroquois National Team, was scheduled for Sept. 28.        
“Hazing practices are harmful and antithetical to our values as a university and our commitment to student-athletes,” Andy Noel, the director of athletics, said in a statement. “They have no place in Cornell University athletics. I am particularly concerned with coercive traditions that abuse the power differential between new students and upperclassmen. Team bonding is important, and there are many ways to achieve it that don’t involve hazing.”        
David Skorton, the university president, and Susan Murphy, the vice president for student and academic services, wrote an article for USA Today in August that addressed the issue of hazing at Cornell and across the country. It noted the death of a 19-year-old sophomore at Cornell “after a fraternity event involving mock kidnapping and coerced drinking.”        
The story cited a University of Maine survey that found 74 percent of varsity athletes had been hazed, along with 64 percent of sports club members and 56 percent of performing arts group members.        
“Hazing must stop now,” Murphy said in a statement.        
The men’s lacrosse team was also to play in the Capital Lacrosse Invitational, scheduled for Oct. 13. That tournament is played in honor of the Mario St. George Boiardi Foundation. Boiardi played lacrosse at Cornell and died in 2004 when he was struck by a ball in the chest during a game.

Andy Reid’s coaching return to Philadelphia was a success Thursday night as he guided the Kansas City Chiefs past the Eagles, 26-16.        


Reid, who won 140 games and 6 division titles with Philadelphia, was fired on the heels of the Eagles’ 4-12 finish last season, and the Chiefs hired him days later.        
On Thursday, the Chiefs’ defense forced five turnovers and had six sacks of Michael Vick, 4 ½ by linebacker Justin Houston. Kansas City (3-0) has won more games under Reid than it did all of last season.        
The Chiefs, who have not had a giveaway this season, got a 38-yard interception return by Eric Berry for a touchdown and a 3-yard scoring run by Jamaal Charles. Ryan Succop kicked four field goals.        
Philadelphia (1-2) had five sacks, but the Eagles were undone by sloppy tackling and an inconsistent performance by the fast-tempo offense brought in by Reid’s replacement, Chip Kelly.        
Vick limped off the field with 1 minutes 34 seconds to go, after the final sack and turnover.        
Vick threw two interceptions, and the Eagles lost two fumbles in the first half. The four turnovers were more than they had in the first two games combined.        
The Eagles scored 63 points and totaled 954 yards in their first two games in Kelly’s frenetic, fast-paced offense. But Kansas City’s swarming defense had plenty of answers.        
Reid got a standing ovation from some of the same fans who chanted, “Fire Andy,” during a game in 2011. His homecoming coincided with the retiring of Donovan McNabb’s No. 5 by the Eagles.        
CLEVELAND SIGNS MCGAHEE The Browns have signed the free-agent running back Willis McGahee, adding a capable veteran after trading Trent Richardson.        
McGahee, 31, passed his physical Thursday. He brings needed experience to Cleveland after the Browns dealt Richardson to Indianapolis on Wednesday. It was not yet known if McGahee would play Sunday, when the Browns visit Minnesota.        
A two-time Pro Bowl selection, McGahee led the Broncos with 731 rushing yards last season. He has been a remarkably durable back during his nine-year N.F.L. career despite sustaining a serious knee injury in his final game in college at Miami.        
McGahee has rushed for 8,097 total yards with three teams. Denver released him in June.        
SPROLES CALLS HIT DIRTY New Orleans running back Darren Sproles said a blow to his head delivered by Tampa Bay defensive back Dashon Goldson was a dirty hit.        
Sproles said Goldson, who was penalized on the play, had a history of dirty hits, adding, “He tried to hurt me on the play, but he didn’t.”        
Goldson was fined $100,000 for the personal foul, which was called on an incomplete pass over the middle. Goldson was also suspended for a game but was then reinstated on appeal. He said he never intended to hurt anybody.        
ANOTHER BROTHER MATCHUP Miami guard John Jerry expects his relatives to show favoritism Sunday when he is blocking his brother, Atlanta defensive tackle Peria Jerry.        
“My mom, brother and sister will be here,” John said. “They’d better be rooting for me. I bought the tickets.”        
The Jerrys have played each other in exhibition games but never before during the regular season. This sibling matchup will be different from Manning versus Manning because it will take place in the trenches and the Jerrys figure to butt heads a lot.

At the start of the racing season at Saratoga Race Course, an aide to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo came across some information he found troubling: the racetrack was to be home to a food truck that, although well-regarded for its pulled pork and brisket, also featured an ethnic slur in its name.        


The aide dashed off an e-mail to the New York Racing Association, the state-controlled track operator, warning that the truck’s name, the Wandering Dago, was “a problem waiting to blow up.” Seven hours later, the racing association ordered the food truck off its premises.        
Now, that July eviction is the subject of a First Amendment lawsuit, pitting the free speech rights of the sandwich sellers against the state’s right to protect visitors from offense.        
In a lawsuit filed last month in Federal District Court in Albany, the food-truck owners, Andrea Loguidice and Brandon Snooks, are challenging their eviction from Saratoga, as well as an earlier decision by the state to forbid the truck from operating at the Empire State Plaza government complex in Albany.        
Ms. Loguidice and Mr. Snooks, who are both Italian-American, said they were ordered to leave Saratoga by a track official, Stephen Travers, a vice president at the racing association, who said his “hands are tied” because a high-ranking state official had contacted the racing association about the truck.        
The ejection happened after Bennett Liebman, Mr. Cuomo’s deputy secretary for gaming and racing, wrote an e-mail expressing concern to Christopher Kay, the chief executive of the New York Racing Association. In the e-mail, which first became public in court on Thursday, Mr. Liebman acknowledged the truck’s name was probably intended to be “self-deprecating,” and did not order the truck ejected, but said the language was problematic.        
“I just believe that people will find the name of the truck both offensive and insensitive, and that the fallout for authorizing this truck will inevitably land on NYRA,” he wrote. “Is there some way to at least modify the name of this particular truck? I see this as a problem waiting to blow up.”        
The pair’s lawyer said that request led to a violation of their constitutional rights.        
“The e-mail corroborates what we’ve said from Day 1, which is this was a state official exercising their own discretion without any standard, censoring our client’s speech,” said George F. Carpinello, a lawyer for Boies, Schiller & Flexner, which is representing the food truck pro bono.        
At the time of the food truck ejection, Mr. Cuomo’s office said the governor’s top aides had not asked for the action, and the racing association’s spokesman said he was not aware of any complaint from the governor’s office. On Thursday, after Mr. Liebman’s e-mail expressing concern about the truck was disclosed, the governor’s spokeswoman said she had been unaware of Mr. Liebman’s e-mail until it was released in court.

BEIJING — Divers have found the body of a missing U.S. stunt pilot whose plane crashed into a lake in northeast China while attempting a tricky maneuver in the rain, the head of the team searching for him said Friday.        


David Riggs, whose U.S. pilot's license had been suspended, had been missing since Tuesday's accident outside the city of Shenyang in which his young female Chinese translator died. Riggs was in China to take part in an air show and was apparently rehearsing one of his tricks when the accident occurred.        
Zhang Fang said Riggs' body was found during a search of the bottom of Lake Caihu by divers from the Dalian branch of the Beihai Rescue Bureau.        
""It's likely he was killed on impact, but we don't know for sure yet,"" Fang said by telephone from the accident scene.        
Riggs' high-performance single-engine Lancair 320 plane broke into pieces after hitting the lake and some parts had been recovered, including one of its two seats. The cause of the accident remains under investigation. The plane was not equipped with a ""black box"" recorder because of its small size.        
Zhang said Riggs crashed while attempting a stunt in which the wheels of his plane were to drag along the lake surface at high speed. He had just taken off in a light rain, but there was no indication he had violated any flying regulations, Zhang said. Other reports said Chinese officials had urged Riggs not to take off, but Zhang said he had no information about that.        
Riggs was a well-known Hollywood stunt pilot, and the center of considerable controversy over a string of legal problems and penchant for self-promotion.        
Riggs' website touts his credentials as a holder of several aviation speed world records, but doesn't mention the fact his U.S. pilot's license had been suspended twice.        
The first time was after buzzing the famed Santa Monica pier in Los Angeles in his Vodochody L-39 Albatros jet trainer. Riggs was sentenced to 60 days of community service and 60 days in jail for reckless flying.        
He lost his license again in November for selling rides in his plane without permission. The prosecution came after a plane piloted by a business partner crashed, killing both people on board.        
Riggs had a stack of other legal problems, including convictions for bank, wire and passport fraud. He aroused such contempt among some pilots that a website — aviationcriminal.com — was devoted to chronicling his misdoings.        
His website describes him as CEO of California-based Mach One Aviation, Inc. and as a ""Hollywood stunt pilot, movie producer and world aviation speed record holder."" It said his aerial performances had featured in movies and television shows including ""Iron Man,"" ''Jarhead,"" and the James Bond film ""Casino Royale.""        
China's official Xinhua News Agency said other U.S. flyers scheduled to take part in Friday's opening ceremony had pulled out of the show. Pilots and aircraft from Sweden, France and Lithuania were due to take part in the show.

AFTER almost a 20-year hiatus, United Airlines is once again urging travelers to “fly the friendly skies.”        


The iconic tagline, created by Leo Burnett in 1965 and used by the carrier until it parted ways with the agency in 1996, has been resurrected in a multimedia ad campaign by McGarryBowen that is United’s largest in decades. The campaign also features George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue,” music United has been using continuously in advertising since 1987.        
The campaign — which begins Sunday on broadcasts of N.F.L. football games; the PGA Tour championship; the season premiere of “60 Minutes” and the Emmy Awards program — contains a refreshed, 21st-century version of the tagline.        
United is now telling travelers it is everything from “legroom friendly” and “online friendly” to “shut-eye friendly” and “EWR friendly,” which refers to the hub of Continental Airlines at Newark Liberty International Airport, which United inherited when the two airlines merged in 2010 to create the world’s largest carrier in terms of passenger traffic.        
Burnett came up with the “fly the friendly skies” tagline in the mid-1960s when it was pitching United’s business. One famous iteration was a TV spot in which wives urged their husbands to “take me along” on business trips, while one print ad featured six United employees, identified by name and position, who urged readers to “come fly with me, and me, and me, and me, and me, and me.”        
After United and Continental — whose agency was the Kaplan Thaler Group — merged, McGarryBowen, New York, part of the Dentsu Aegis Network unit of Dentsu, became United’s agency in 2011.        
Tom O’Toole, United’s senior vice president for marketing and loyalty, said United had opted to return to the Burnett tagline because it wanted to “re-establish United’s position as the world’s leading” customer-focused airline.        
He called the timing of its reintroduction “a convergence of a series of advances.” Since 2010, United has completed installation of premium-cabin flatbed seats on select international flights, expanded its economy-plus seating, improved its on-time performance and invested in new customer service training programs for all customer-contact employees.        
“The real aim” of the new advertising, Mr. O’Toole said, is to “say to customers, co-workers and competitors that United is back in the game in a big way.”        
One TV spot features musicians playing “Rhapsody in Blue” and shows space available in various classes and in overhead bins, as well as United employees in the cockpit and cabin. The voice-over is provided by the actor Matt Damon, who also did the voice-over on United’s 2012 summer Olympics TV advertising.        
One print ad shows a man rushing into his home, arms outstretched, to greet his children. The copy says, “Right place, right time-friendly. Fly on your schedule with over 5,000 daily flights. Fly the friendly skies. United.com/flyerfriendly.”        
Besides TV and print, media used by the campaign will include radio; outdoor, including in airports; digital; and social media, all with messages promoting United as “friendly.” All advertising except radio features an abstract route map, one leg of which has a dot at each end that could be interpreted as a smiley face.        
Gordon Bowen, chairman and chief creative officer of McGarryBowen, said this design was inspired by the logo United adopted when it merged with Continental, whose own logo was a globe.        
Mr. O’Toole said the campaign was aimed primarily at United’s “most frequent-traveling, high-yield customers,” as well as at employees “who will enable United to deliver exactly what we’re talking about. It sets an aspirational target for the customer experience United delivers.”        
He said United would spend more than $30 million in advertising air travel in the fourth quarter and maintain the same level of spending next year, when it will sponsor the United States Olympic team at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. He called these expenditures the carrier’s “largest in decades.”        
According to Kantar Media, in recent years, United has spent from $4.3 million in 2009 to $43.9 million in 2012 to advertise air travel.        
Both Michael Derchin, an airline analyst at CRT Capital, and Michael Linenberg, who follows the airline industry for Deutsche Bank, commended United on the timing of the new campaign. “It’s particularly important now because of the service problems they had last year, with the integration of United’s and Continental’s computer systems,” Mr. Derchin said. “They had horrendous on-time performance problems and consumer complaints.”        
David Reibstein, who teaches marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, predicted the new campaign would be “more efficient” for United since many travelers will recall the old tagline.        
Marty Kohr, a lecturer in integrated marketing communications at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, said it was “very smart” for McGarryBowen to update the “friendly skies” concept.        
Henry Harteveldt, travel analyst for Hudson Crossing, called the campaign “a very bold move for United,” but said the advertising carried “the risk of failure: If passengers don’t see United fulfilling its promise of being a ‘user-friendly’ airline, the advertising will be seen as hollow and will backfire.”        
Tim Winship, publisher of FrequentFlier.com, a Web site on travel loyalty programs, was dismissive of the campaign, calling “friendly skies” “so last century. In 2013, the skies are anything but friendly, and to suggest otherwise is to insult the intelligence of consumers and invite their scorn.”

If your idea of living the dream involves banging around the desert in a Pontiac Aztek that has seen better days, the dream just got closer.        


Screenbid.com, a new auction site focused on the sale of movie and television props, is set to go live on Friday with a preview of its first offerings: about 250 items from AMC’s “Breaking Bad” television series, including a dull green Aztek that was used, and abused, by the show’s meth-dealing antihero, Walter White.        
“We have Walt’s Aztek and the Monte Carlo,” along with other paraphernalia, said Bill Block, a film producer who is joining the entrepreneur Jeffrey A. Dash in founding Screenbid.        
The site, they said, is intended to help studios dispose of props systematically, and profitably — props that might otherwise be locked in storage, or offered more haphazardly on eBay or Craigslist, sometimes by individuals who simply walked them off a set.        
The “Breaking Bad” auction, they said, was organized in collaboration with Sony Pictures Entertainment, whose television unit helped produce the show.        
According to Mr. Block and Mr. Dash, who spoke by telephone earlier this week, the auction will actually begin on Sept. 29, when the last episode of the series is shown. (Some items will not be listed until then, to protect plot points.) Sony, they said, has set an undisclosed reserve price on items, which will be withheld if the price is not met.        
The price of Hollywood collectibles is notoriously elastic — who’d have figured on the $5,000 bid for 12 cans of beer at the “Lost” auction, run by Profiles in History? But Mr. Block reckoned that the “Breaking Bad” props could yield more than $2 million.        
Sony Pictures, the new site’s founders said, is already in line with a second auction, which will sell memorabilia from its film “This Is the End,” including furnishings from the movie’s version of James Franco’s home. Props and other items on Screenbid, they added, are authenticated by the studio or producers and artists involved with the sale.        
The “Breaking Bad” sale already lists Hazmat suits, a charred pink Teddy bear, a Lucite-encased grill and various automobiles familiar to viewers of the series, about White, a high school chemistry teacher who becomes a kingpin in New Mexico’s methamphetamine trade.        
But Sony is not selling White’s mobile meth lab, a Fleetwood Bounder RV, said Mr. Block. “They’re keeping it for their on-the-lot tour,” he explained.

Faced with rising student debt and declining applications to law schools, a task force of the American Bar Association is calling for sweeping changes in legal education, including training people without law degrees to provide limited legal services and opening the bar to those who have not completed four years of college and three years of  law school.         
The report, to be issued on Friday, does not refer specifically to President Obama’s suggestion last month that law schools might limit classes to two years, and have students spend their third year clerking or practicing in a firm. But it did recommend the elimination of the rules that law students must have 45,000 minutes in a classroom to graduate and that they cannot get credit for field placements that are paid.        
The report describes an urgent need for change in the nation’s legal education.          
“The system faces considerable pressure because of the price many students pay, the large amounts of student debt, consecutive years of sharply falling applications, and dramatic changes, possibly structural, in the jobs available to law graduates,” it said.  “These have resulted in real economic stresses on law school, damage to career and economic prospects of many recent graduates, and diminished public confidence in the system of legal education.”        
It called  the predicament of the many recent graduates who may never get the kind of jobs they anticipated  “particularly compelling.”        
The report is still a draft, to be distributed for comment, then considered at the bar association’s 2014 meeting. If adopted there, it will be influential but not binding on either law schools or state bar associations.        
Randall T. Shepard, the former Indiana chief justice who was chairman of the task force, said that within the group, the most controversial sections were those dealing with how legal education is financed and with the accreditation standards.        
The report criticizes the practice of most law schools to provide little aid to needy students, reserving most of their scholarships for those with the highest credentials in part to help raise the school’s rankings.        
“There were very prickly long discussions about whether the language in the report accurately describes the situation,” Mr. Shepard said. “The other issue where there was real disagreement was on the list of items in the accreditation standards that we thought should be liberalized or eliminated.”        
Among the items on the list are  the standards on credit  for  work  before law school matriculation, distance education, student-faculty ratios, the proportion of courses taught by full-time faculty, tenure, physical facilities and more.        
The overall idea, said James. B. Kobak Jr., a New York lawyer on the task force, was to free law schools to be more innovative and get away from the one-size-fits-all model.        
But Leo P. Martinez, a task force member who is president of the Association of American Law Schools, said that while he generally embraced the idea of encouraging heterogeneity among law schools, he thought the standards helped to ensure an “irreducible minimum of quality.”          
Mr. Shepard said that there had been little controversy over the use of  nonlawyer practitioners, in part  because the members were so impressed by Washington State’s experiment with limited-license legal technicians, trained and licensed to handle certain civil legal matters. That program’s success has led to an expansion to practitioners for domestic relations, an area in which many of those who come to court are now unrepresented.        
The report, citing the wide variety of colleges in the United States, called for more differentiation and experimentation by law schools.  It  also recommended the  creation of national standards for admission to the bar.

JAKARTA — India’s central bank announced on Friday a complex series of changes to its interest rate policies, aimed at maintaining control of inflation while also making credit more available to the troubled industrial sector.         
The Reserve Bank of India cut by three-quarters of a percentage point the short-term interest rate that has had the most effect on bank lending rates lately, while, in an unexpected move, raising by a quarter of a percentage point a separate interest rate that many banks rely on for their underlying financing.        
The United States Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday not to begin decreasing its level of economic stimulus has given India a respite during which to pursue slightly less stringent monetary policies of its own. The Reserve Bank of India tightened policy sharply in mid-July in an effort to halt the fall of the rupee in currency markets.        
The rupee continued to drop until the end of August, when a move by the central bank to provide dollars from its reserves to the country’s state-controlled oil distribution companies finally halted the tumble. The rupee and the Indian stock market, like currencies and shares in other emerging markets, rallied sharply on Thursday after the Fed’s decision on Wednesday.        
The Reserve Bank of India has two short-term interest rates. Commercial banks are allowed to borrow part of their funds at the repurchase, or repo, rate, which was raised on Friday to 7.5 percent, from 7.25 percent.        
Many in the Indian financial markets have long focused on the repo rate, even though it has been less important lately, and were disappointed to see it rise instead of fall on Friday.        
“India’s core inflationary requirements mean that the market can no longer expect a complete rollback of interest rates,” said Vaibhav Agrawal, vice president for research and banking at Angel Broking.        
Further borrowing by commercial banks comes from the so-called marginal standing facility, whose interest rate was cut on Friday to 9.5 percent, from 10.25 percent. Because the cost of borrowing for banks to make additional loans is essentially the interest rate on the marginal standing facility, that rate tends to have a greater effect on the interest rates that banks charge customers for loans.        
The reduction of the marginal standing facility by 0.75 percentage point “is encouraging, as this is working as the short-term interest rate,” said Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry.        
After the central bank’s action, the Mumbai stock exchange sagged 1.9 percent, wiping out much of the gain it had posted the previous day. The rupee fell to 62.44 per dollar, from about 62 just before the announcement.        
While short-term interest rates may sound high in India, they are only slightly above inflation, with prices up 9.5 percent in August from a year ago at the consumer level and up 6.1 percent at the wholesale level.

CHICAGO — A gunman involved in a shooting that wounded 13 people at a South Side park on Thursday night was armed with an assault-style rifle equipped with a high-capacity magazine, the police said on Friday.        


“A military-grade weapon on the streets of Chicago is simply unacceptable,” Garry McCarthy, the Chicago police superintendent, said at a news conference, where he issued another of his frequent calls for tighter state and federal gun laws.        
Among the wounded was a 3-year-old boy, who was struck in the face but was expected to survive. The boy and two other people, also expected to survive, were hospitalized in critical condition. Mr. McCarthy said it was a miracle that no one was killed.        
The police said that no arrests had been made and that investigators were uncertain about the intended target, the motive, or even the number of people who fired weapons. There may have been only one gunman, Mr. McCarthy said, or as many as three.        
The attack, which took place during a pickup basketball game, was the latest flare-up of street violence that has confounded city leaders. Chicago had more than 500 homicides in 2012 — more than any other city in the nation and about 80 more than New York, which has three times as many people.        
Most of the violence has occurred in poorer neighborhoods on Chicago’s South and West Sides, and Thursday’s shooting again vaulted the issue to the center of a continuing conversation here about the causes of gun violence and potential solutions.        
Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Friday canceled his events on the East Coast and planned to fly home because of the shooting, his aides said. Among the events called off were a scheduled appearance at a rally on behalf of Mayor Cory Booker of Newark, the Democratic United States Senate candidate in New Jersey, and meetings in Washington with the secretaries of energy and labor.        
“The perpetrators of this crime will be brought to justice and prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” Mr. Emanuel said in a statement. “I encourage everyone in the community to step forward with any information and everyone in Chicago to continue their individual efforts to build stronger communities where violence has no place.”        
The attack in Cornell Square Park occurred amid a rash of other shootings around the city on Thursday evening that left two dead and at least nine other people wounded, the police reported.        
Mr. McCarthy said on Friday that while typically few witnesses volunteer information to officers after shootings, the attack in the park had generated fury — and help.        
“We’re getting a ton of cooperation,” he said. “People are rightfully outraged.”        
Because some of the wounded had gang affiliations, the police said, investigators suspected that the shooting was linked to the city’s warring street gangs, which the authorities say have splintered into increasingly complicated groups in recent years.        
In recent months, the city has sought to combat such violence by deploying hundreds of officers, some on overtime, to 20 zones plagued by shootings. The result, the police said, is a murder rate about 20 percent lower this year than in 2012. But the park, situated in the city’s Back of the Yards neighborhood, is not within one of those 20 zones.        
“Every time something happens, we suffer a setback,” Mr. McCarthy said Friday. “The fact is, we’re doing better. The fact is, we have a long way to go.”

Culture,"










PARIS — There was a time when Paris was an obligatory way station for aspiring foreign writers on the Grand Tour through Europe as they strove to burnish their reputations as cosmopolitan sophisticates. But in recent years, the city seems to have lost some of its edge. Now Paris has reached out to recapture its place as a center of literature with a new festival of international writers that began on Friday and ran through the weekend.        


“There’s a sense in America that France is a country of culture, but when you are looking from the inside, a lot of people have been complaining that France needs to find its beating heart again,” said Lila Azam Zanganeh, a French-Iranian writer who lives in New York and is one of the authors who took part in the festival, Écrivains du Monde.        
“In the 1800s, you had to be here in France,” Ms. Zanganeh said. “Baudelaire was an inventor of the word ‘modern’; he looked at what being a bohemian meant, and it was extraordinarily important; Nabokov was published in Paris, but then it peters off in the late ’60s and the early ’70s: there was a bit of a trough, a slump, and I think France is looking for its pulse.”        
The Écrivains du Monde festival may not, on its own, recreate the vibrant sense of literary experimentation and adventure of the first half of the 20th century, when Paris was home to the likes of Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett and Eugène Ionesco, but it signals a new appreciation of the primacy of international writing.        
Perhaps not surprisingly, then, the festival is the brainchild of an American, Paul LeClerc, director of Columbia University’s Global Center for Europe, which is based in Paris, and an Australian, Caro Llewellyn, the festival’s artistic director. Ms. Llewellyn has made a profession of bringing together international writers and giving them a forum to talk about literature.        
The inaugural festival drew together some 28 writers from 19 countries. Most are not French; they have been translated into French and have a French following. The authors, who were paid small stipends, include some of the best-known fiction writers at work today: Salman Rushdie, John Banville, Richard Ford, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, David Grossman, Ma Jian and Michael Ondaatje. Also attending were several authors who write in French, though are not all from France, including two from Lebanon and a Canadian-Haitian, Dany LaFerrière. The writers came to Paris for three days, and a few are going on to spend two days in Lyon on Monday and Tuesday. They held intimate — and sometimes not so intimate — talks with their readers and literary enthusiasts. Several events were at the Louvre Auditorium, which holds some 400 people.        
But most were at smaller sites, where the audience and the authors could go back and forth. At a talk on writing about love in the midst of war, the Pakistani writer Nadeem Aslam described how he had spoken only Urdu until his family was forced to flee Pakistan for Britain when he was 14. It was in university that he taught himself how to write in English by copying longhand the works of great fiction writers, starting with William Faulkner’s “As I Lay Dying,” and moving on to Cormac McCarthy’s “Blood Meridian,” Toni Morrison’s “Beloved” and Gabriel García Márquez’s “Autumn of the Patriarch.”        
The talks’ moderators were matched to the authors, with, for instance, Mr. Aslam’s talk moderated by Steve Coll, dean of Columbia University’s School of Journalism and a Pulitzer Prize-winning nonfiction writer on the region that Mr. Aslam writes novels about.        
The informal but informed atmosphere appeared to be what Mr. LeClerc, a scholar of French literature and a former president of the New York Public Library, was striving for. “This is not an academic conference,” he said. “It is meant to engage the broader public.”        
He had the idea for the festival about a year ago and set about gathering French partners who would donate locations for the events, lend their backing and give the imprimatur of the French cultural elite.

Cardinals (1-1) at Saints (2-0) 


1 p.m. Sunday Line: Saints by 7 ½ 
New Orleans could just as easily be 0-2, with its two victories coming on the final play against division rivals Atlanta and Tampa Bay. The Saints’ vaunted offense has sputtered, averaging just 19 ½ points per game (they averaged more than 32 points last season), and has converted only one of seven red-zone opportunities for a touchdown. The coaching staff appears hellbent on making Mark Ingram happen, and, at this point, he is not.        
Rob Ryan has clearly embraced New Orleans’s culture of excess, and his revamped defense — the same unit that gave up the most yards in N.F.L. history last season — deserves much of the credit for the team’s record.        
That said, Carson Palmer has been relatively successful in past matchups against Ryan-coached defenses, but he could be without his main threat if Larry Fitzgerald’s sore hamstring prevents him from dressing.        
Worth noting: This will be a homecoming for the New Orleans native Tyrann Mathieu, Arizona’s rookie cornerback/special teams ace. Look for him to make a play that proves pivotal to the game’s outcome. Pick: Cardinals        
Packers (1-1) at Bengals (1-1) 
1 p.m. Sunday Line: Packers by 2 ½ 
No undefeated teams are matched up in Week 3, making this perhaps the most intriguing matchup on the schedule, yet it is not even close to a must-watch game. If ever there was a time to score some points with your significant other by putting aside football, this is the weekend to do it. Maybe agree to having Sunday brunch, then seeing “Enough Said,” with James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Movie critics really liked it, so there’s that!        
Pick: Packers        
Texans (2-0) at Ravens (1-1) 
1 p.m. Sunday Line: Texans by 2 ½ 
The former Baltimore safety Ed Reed contended last week that it was not a big deal that injuries would keep him out of this game for Houston.        
“It’s nothing that urged me to play this week,” Reed said on Rich Eisen’s podcast. “You know, I didn’t circle this on the calendar.”        
Well, to that we say, balderdash! If Reed did not circle this game on the calendar, he had a giant electronic countdown clock installed in his house to remind him down to the second how much time he had to recover and run through the tunnel and onto the field on Sunday, the day his longtime teammate Ray Lewis will be inducted into the Ravens’ Ring of Honor at halftime.        
The Texans have been unimpressive in their two wins, and the Ravens, who are 19-2 in their last 21 home games, are due to finally overcome the Super Bowl hangover that has slowed them. A frenzied, big-game home crowd should do the trick.        
Pick: Ravens        
Giants (0-2) at Panthers (0-2) 
1 p.m. Sunday Line: Panthers by 1 
Every year, it seems that one player whom the fantasy football experts tout as the next big thing ends up being a spectacular bust. Going into this season, the Giants’ David Wilson was the sleeper many picked to have a monster year. Well, so much for that.        
Signing Brandon Jacobs did not do much to improve their running game in Week 2 against Denver. The Giants rushed for 23 yards on 19 carries for a 1.2 average. They are ranked last in the league in rushing.        
What’s Tiki Barber up to these days?        
Pick: Giants        
Chargers (1-1) at Titans (1-1) 
1 p.m. Sunday Line: Titans by 3 
Two things that appear to have been resurrected this season: Philip Rivers’s arm, which at times last season was compared to an overcooked chicken wing, and the swagger of the Tennessee defense, perhaps because of Gregg Williams’s return to an N.F.L. sideline.        
Fun fact: the Titans have not beaten San Diego since they were the Houston Oilers, George H. W. Bush was in the White House and Boyz II Men’s “End of the Road” topped the Billboard charts (Sept. 27, 1992, to be exact). With Malcom Floyd out indefinitely with a neck injury after being taken off the field on a stretcher in Week 2, that streak ends Sunday.        
Pick: Titans        
Browns (0-2) at Vikings (0-2) 
1 p.m. Sunday Line: Vikings by 6 ½ 
Cleveland traded running back Trent Richardson, its best offensive player and the third player taken in the 2012 draft, to Indianapolis for a first-round draft pick. That means the Browns will have a total of 10 picks — seven in the first four rounds — in the 2014 draft.        
Is Cleveland “Drowning for (Jadeveon) Clowney,” perhaps?        
Pick: Vikings        
Buccaneers (0-2) at Patriots (2-0) 
1 p.m. Sunday Line: Patriots by 7 
Two games into the season, Tampa Bay is said to have called a players-only meeting, the starting quarterback Josh Freeman is reportedly asking to be traded, and the star cornerback Darrelle Revis is clashing with Coach Greg Schiano. If that were not enough, New England Coach Bill Belichick has had 10 days to prepare his Patriots to play the rapidly imploding Buccaneers.        
Pick: Patriots        
Rams (1-1) at Cowboys (1-1) 
         
1 p.m. Sunday Line: Cowboys by 4 
Run-challenged St. Louis travels to Jerry Jones’s stadium version of an Affliction shirt to take on equally run-challenged Dallas. So look for Sam Bradford, who let it fly 55 times in a road loss to Atlanta last week, and Tony Romo to air it out in this one. Worth noting: DeMarco Murray rushed for 253 yards, a single-game Cowboys record, the last time these teams played.

1913 American Wins Golf Title 
BROOKLINE, Mass. — The most sensational thing that ever happened in the history of golf anywhere, or that was possible to happen, marked the end of to-day’s [Sept. 20] playoff of the tie between Vardon, Ray and Ouimet for the Open Golf Championship. Francis Ouimet, the American, outplayed the Britishers in a most astounding manner, making 72, a new course record for an amateur, while Vardon made 77 and Ray 78. The course was as soft as a sponge throughout its 6,425 yards. Despite the rain, three thousand persons followed the players from the start at 10 o’clock. They rounded every hole until the gallery of enthusiasts had grown to six thousand. So brilliant was Ouimet’s golf, he actually would have beaten his opponents in best ball match play by one up.        
 
1938 Hankow Readies for Battle 
HANKOW — With heated battles surging back and forth on the arched front through the Yangtse Valley, east of here, Hankow itself today [Sept. 20] rushed work on fortifications within the city area. Barbed wire and sandbags were strung through all sections, and stronger defenses are appearing in more vital spots. Both Chinese and Japanese claimed successes at various points along the front. The Chinese launched a savage counter-attack in the north-bank Hwangmei and Kwangtsi sectors and halted the Japanese advance there, but the invaders said they moved ahead, though slowly, in their drives on Sinyang, Hwangmei and Tehan and also asserted they had completed their conquest of Wusueh, which they entered yesterday. Japanese themselves admitted that a terrific Chinese attack, launched despite torrential downpours, had cost them dearly in the Hwangmei and Kwangtsi sectors.        
 
1963 Mansfield Warns of Disaster  
WASHINGTON — Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield demanded today that all United States agencies in South Vietnam unite behind Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge. Unless they do, he said, “we are face to face with a disaster” there. The Montana Democrat, an expert on foreign policy, did not accuse any particular American agency or individuals of causing dissension in Saigon. However, observers interpreted his unusually forceful speech as being directed against the Central Intelligence Agency and some elements in the American Military Mission to South Vietnam.

Perhaps the only point on which gun enthusiasts and gun control advocates agree is that firearms should be kept out of the hands of criminals and the insane.         
Supplying a gun to someone who subsequently uses it in committing a crime facilitates and abets that crime. It follows that anyone who supplies a gun to another that is then used to commit a crime is an accessory to that crime. “Supplying” can mean selling the gun, giving it, lending it or merely leaving it out where it can be taken rather than safely locked away, and includes allowing it to be stolen by a housebreaker, the source of many guns used by criminals.        
It might be argued that gun owners should not be blamed for the use someone else makes of their weapons, but gun rights supporters often emphasize responsible gun ownership. What does such responsibility mean if not keeping guns out of dangerous hands? Just as someone who provides financial services or who sells or rents houses is exhorted to “know your customer,” is it not the responsibility of gun owners and those who sell guns to take precautions against letting criminals or maniacs get hold of them?        
I propose that federal legislation be enacted that would treat anyone who supplies a firearm to another person who later uses it in committing a criminal act as an accessory to that act, punishable as a principal. In the case of guns that have passed through several hands, as is often the case, the last identifiable owner should be held responsible.

Julia Wurz was the media executive for the Formula One team that was Benetton and then became Renault, from 1998 to 2001. She is married to the former Formula One driver Alexander Wurz and runs her own public relations agency based in Monaco. She spoke with Brad Spurgeon of the International Herald Tribune about “SuperEgo,” her first novel.  
Q. How did you get the idea of writing the novel? 
A. It was actually after reading “The Devil Wears Prada.” I liked the book and I thought, “But I know people more extreme than this!” And I thought it was an angle to come in on, that I could do something so similar, and yet that it was an angle that had never been done about Formula One.        
Q. How big was the challenge to make Vincent Dupont, the main character, and the plot believable? 
A. That was exactly my goal. Vincent’s behavior is extreme, but not that extreme that anyone who works in Formula One would think is totally unrealistic. I wanted you to totally believe that that guy would be here, would do that, to think, “I can see him, I know the guy.” My benchmark was that I wanted Formula One people to say, “I could believe that could happen.”        
Q. How important was it to have Formula One, very much a man’s world, seen through a woman’s eyes? 
A. I felt it had to be a girl’s view to get that one step removed. Because I think it is such a man’s world that otherwise you can’t quite take that step back to see when certain situations have gotten to a certain ridiculousness or an irony. It is very easy to get lost in it. A girl can never totally penetrate this world. So it gave it a chance to just have a step back and look. Which I felt was important because Kate is a fan, but it was also giving that extra, slight distance.        
Q. Did you aim to interest non-F1 fans? 
A. I read books in industries that I know nothing about, and if the story is good I also like to learn about something totally different, or life in a different country. So I hope the book functions on the two levels, one for people who like Formula One, but also for people who like a good story and an intrigue that works.

It might seem that there could be no bigger contrast than that between riding a unicycle and driving the fastest racing cars in the world. The former is one of the slowest forms of wheel transportation, while the latter is the fastest.        


Yet as a lifetime fan of Formula One and a longtime rider of unicycles, I came to suspect that there was in fact a bigger connection between the two than meets the eye. Over the years, I have repeatedly discovered Formula One drivers past and present who had ridden unicycles before graduating to the bigger, four-wheel machines.        
The first I learned of it was when I saw Mika Hakkinen riding a unicycle as he celebrated his world drivers’ title in 1998, when he drove for McLaren Mercedes. I later met an Irish former Formula One driver, David Kennedy, who had ridden a unicycle in the 1970s.        
More recently, I discovered that Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, who were childhood friends, racing rivals and as of this year teammates at the Mercedes team, had also ridden unicycles as teenagers. And last year I saw a short video clip of Jean-Éric Vergne, a driver at the Toro Rosso team, riding a unicycle when he visited the Cirque du Soleil in Montreal.        
In a related vein, I also knew that Alexander Wurz, who raced for several Formula One teams from 1997 to 2007, had won the world championship of BMX cycling at the age of 13.        
So I began to wonder if there was some connection between cycling balance and auto racing, and I decided to investigate by bringing my unicycle to the Belgian Grand Prix last month. There, I watched as both Vergne and Rosberg gave it a spin around the paddock. Despite their claims to have not really ridden a unicycle for years, both drivers were able to jump on it and ride around without a single fall — to my great relief — on their first attempt.        
I asked Wurz, who at 39 still competes in the top level of sports-car racing and also teaches race-driving courses to young drivers at the International Automobile Federation, the governing body of auto sport, if he thought there was a cycling/racing connection.        
“If we talk of the talent of a racing driver, part of whatever talent is defined will be balance skill, quite a large part,” Wurz said. “All of the drivers turn out to have very good balance and they can use their balance skills to learn very quickly. So you would maybe see that most of the drivers, even if they haven’t touched a unicycle, very quickly get it.”        
He was right: My recollection of learning the unicycle at about 15 was that it took me at least two weeks to get it. But Hamilton, according to Rosberg, learned to ride his unicycle in a couple of hours.        
The fiercely competitive Hamilton was extra-motivated by the fact that Rosberg had his unicycle first. Rosberg’s father, Keke Rosberg, a former Formula One driver, had managed Hakkinen’s career, and knew that the Finnish driver had gone to circus school and used to ride his unicycle to high school through the snow. Hakkinen was also known as something of an acrobatic Formula One driver, and his skill was linked to the unicycle.        
Rosberg said that he received his unicycle as a present for Christmas.        
“And when I get such a challenge, I always make it happen,” he said.        
What he did not count on was that when Hamilton, his teammate in go-karting at the time, saw Rosberg riding the unicycle in the paddock, he had to do it, too.        
“He was the one with a unicycle and being as competitive as I am, I wanted to be able to do it as well,” said Hamilton, who, like Rosberg, is 28. “He was really good at it and then I got it and practiced and practiced and practiced,” adding, “I had to be better than him. Eventually I could do it backwards and everything, and eventually he gave up.”        
Vergne’s discovery of the unicycle also had a go-karting link. He learned how to ride the unicycle at his parent’s go-karting track business outside Paris, aiming to improve his balance so that he would be a better racing car driver.        
“I started at 14, 15 years old on my parent’s karting track,” said Vergne, 23. “My dad told me that it was always important to have a good sense of balance in auto racing, and we thought that it was a good idea for me to learn how to do that, so I learned how to do it.”        
He said that although he could not feel a direct link between unicycling and auto racing, he said it was clear that balance was important.        
“Balancing is important to feel the car better, especially in changing conditions of the track,” he said. “And being a little bit of an acrobat, and knowing when the car is going to slide is important.”        
Wurz said it was the same with BMX.        
“It’s all about balance in BMX,” he said. “It is very much about balance and feeling, the grip you have on the gravel in corners, how much speed you can carry, the jumps, the starting gate. Cycling is all to do with using balance and a sense of gravity to your advantage.”        
“To feel the limit of the car you need to understand how much your car is rolling, what your tire is doing, when the tire is gripping — and that is a balance skill,” he added.        
Still, while I have not the slightest doubt that if I tried driving a Formula One car I would reach speeds only roughly half those of these great drivers, I was pleased to learn that Vergne and I did actually share the same technique for learning the unicycle : “By falling down a lot,” as he said.

The Marina Bay temporary street circuit on which the Singapore Grand Prix runs this weekend is the second-slowest track of the season, after Monaco, with an average speed of 172 kilometers per hour, and an average cornering speed of 105 k.p.h.        


With its 23 corners, extreme heat and humidity, and night running, Singapore’s 106.8-mile race is one of the season’s hardest on the cars, brakes, tires and drivers, leaving no part of the setup unpunished.        
It’s a bumpy track, and because it is used just once a year, for the Grand Prix, the grip changes throughout the weekend as it collects rubber from both the elite competitors’ cars and those of the support races. That means that the teams must spend the entire weekend trying to deal with the continually moving target of the best car setup.        
Ten of the corners are in the final sector of the track; drivers change gears more than 5,000 times during the race; and, at more than 100 seconds, the lap time is the longest of the year. In fact, with its 61 laps, the race has either reached the official two-hour limit, as it did last year, or gone to within five minutes of the limit every year since the first Singapore Grand Prix in 2008.        
Approximately 46 percent of the lap is taken at full throttle, compared with more than 75 percent at the previous race, at the high-speed, low-downforce track in Monza, Italy. Singapore’s twisty layout is hard on brakes and, with all the gear changes, on the gearboxes.        
“The Marina Bay circuit has a low average speed due to the high amount of corners,” said Rémi Taffin, the head of the Renault engine provider’s track operations.        
“So the emphasis is on giving the drivers driveability through the lower rev ranges — between 8,000 r.p.m. and 13,000 r.p.m. — and a responsive engine on the short links between the right-angle turns,” he said. “Engine maps need to give good traction, so this is a race we’ll work particularly closely with the chassis engineers to get a neutral set up.”        
Pirelli will provide the teams its medium and supersoft tires. The tight and twisty corners make the supersoft version — not used since the Canadian Grand Prix in June — the right tire to generate traction and grip, while the medium tire contributes extra durability.        
“The second half of the season started off with two of the fastest and most demanding races for tires of the year, in Belgium and Italy,” said Paul Hembery, the director of the Pirelli tire motor-sport program.        
“Singapore is a completely different challenge: the final street race of the season, which is ideal territory for the supersoft tires,” he added. “As always, our selections have concentrated on providing the best opportunities for strategy as well as the most effective race tires.”        
Because it is a long race, the cars carry one of the heaviest fuel loads of the year. That puts a lot more energy into the tires at the start of the race, requiring particular attention to managing the first stint.        
One of the biggest causes of tire wear, however, is wheel-spin. So the rear suspension must be set up to give maximum longitudinal grip.        
Unusual for a street race, Singapore is hot and humid, with high speeds, heavy braking areas and so many corners. The tires have to perform well under traction and braking. The only relief for the tires is that because it is a night race, the track temperature drops from a high of around 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in the day to around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) during the race.        
But that still makes for a hot and humid race, one of the toughest of the season. Twenty percent of the lap is done on braking and 45 percent at full throttle. Drivers undergo 2.5G’s for three seconds at Turn 22.        
“All the corners are generally taken in second or third gear, so you’re trying to find the best setup compromise,” said Jenson Button, a driver at the McLaren Mercedes team, “particularly as you need good end-of-straight speed for overtaking into Turn 7.”        
Because it is a bumpy circuit, the setup must favor the mechanical over the aerodynamic. But its slow, twisty nature also requires maximum downforce on both the front and rear wings.        
The many high curbs require good suspension compliance, and the frequent braking requires the car to be set up soft.        
Brake cooling, like engine cooling, is difficult not so much because of hard braking but because of frequent braking throughout the whole lap. The wear and tear is on all parts of the brakes: discs, pads and calipers. To help cool the engine, the car’s bodywork must often be opened in various places.

Formula One has always been an innovative force in technology for road cars, as the sport’s teams seek quick, reliable solutions to create better, faster cars in an environment that is more competitive and evolves faster than that of the consumer car industry.        


In recent years, however, as the series has moved away from purely mechanical to electronic systems in the racing car, in the pit-lane garages and the whole team environment of a race, innovations from the series have expanded far beyond the realm of the automobile.        
They now extend into many other aspects of daily life, from training the military and hospital operating-room staff using pit-stop tactics to designing watches and luggage with Formula One car materials and techniques.        
One of the most advanced extensions of the lessons learned through the harsh, competitive environment of a Formula One race is now helping to create a future that will touch on just about every aspect of life.        
Known as the internet of things, it has to do with the electronic connectivity of our everyday lives and the vast network that has already begun to connect everything from our cars to the roads to our home and hospitals and even agriculture, with the “smart cows,” with biometric monitoring and analysis, watching grazing rotations and milk solids data analysis.        
The McLaren Formula One team has even connected sick babies with their telemetry system in a hospital in Britain to provide early warning of ailments, like a heart attack.        
In fact, no other team of the sport’s elite racing teams is as deeply involved in the study of improving the internet of things as is the McLaren team, through its sister company, McLaren Electronic Systems.        
The company, which is based in Britain, provides the engine control unit, or ECU, to all of the other Formula One teams and, since last year, to the Nascar teams in the U.S.-based auto racing series.        
An ECU is the electronic brain of a racing car that controls the engine to ensure optimal performance. It also sends data back to the team garage and the team factory, and that is one of the links to the internet of things.        
The internet of things consists of the billions of connections, a kind of universal global neural network in the computing cloud, that is expected to make almost every aspect of our lives “connected” in the future.        
McLaren’s racing environment is branching out into the larger world via its work with the Freescale Semiconductor company of Austin, Texas, which considers itself the internet of things company.        
Freescale provides the computer chips that are the brains and channels of this electronic equipment.        
In a report on the internet of things by Kaivan Karimi, a director of Freescale Semiconductor, and Gary Atkinson, a director at ARM, a British semiconductor and software company, the authors use one of the most common examples to illustrate the functioning of the Internet of Things: a toaster.        
“Your old toaster that mechanically controlled the color of your toast now has an MCU (a micro-controller) in it, and the MCU controls the color of your toast,” the authors wrote. “The toaster completes its task more consistently and reliably, and because it is now a smart toaster, it has the ability to communicate with you electronically using its touchpad or switches.”        
“After a device becomes smart through the integration of embedded processing, the next logical step is remote communication with the smart device to help make life easier,” they added. “For example, if I am running late at the office, can I turn on my house lights for security reasons using my laptop or mobile phone?”        
That is precisely where the connection to Formula One and the ECU and other electronic sensors and telemetry of a Formula One car come into play. Freescale uses Formula One, something of a microcosm of the wider world of the Internet of Things, as a laboratory for developing its chips. »        
“A Formula One event is increasingly one in which everything is connected, just like the internet of things,” said Peter van Manen, the managing director of McLaren Electronic Systems.

LOS ANGELES — On Friday, Joseph Gordon-Levitt enters the ranks of first-time feature directors with “Don Jon,” an edgy romantic comedy he stars in and also wrote. But in a way, it’s the culmination of a directing education that stretches back to his appearance in Robert Redford’s 1992 big-screen adaptation of the fly-fishing-brothers-in-Montana tale, “A River Runs Through It.” 


“The cinematographer came up to me and said, ‘You have to hit your mark exactly,’ ” Mr. Gordon-Levitt said, recalling how, at 10, such an admonition would have had him fixating on the colored tape on the floor he was meant to stand on, thoughts of dialogue and motivation out the window. Then Mr. Redford approached him: “Bob said, ‘I never hit my mark.’ ”        
Mr. Gordon-Levitt, whose professional acting career had begun four years earlier and included more than a dozen appearances on commercials and television, would later realize that Mr. Redford was showing him how a director helps a child actor give his best performance.        
“He was putting the priorities back in line for me,” Mr. Gordon-Levitt said. “It was like, ‘Yeah, it’s important to try and be in the right place, but let them worry about making the shot technically look right. Your job is to focus on the acting.’ “        
Since then, Mr. Gordon-Levitt has absorbed directing tips from all manner of gifted filmmakers. Steven Spielberg, who directed him in “Lincoln,” taught him that a relentlessly upbeat attitude will spread to a cast and crew.        
“You’d think: ‘Oh. Steven Spielberg. He must be a little blasé about it by now,’ ” Mr. Gordon-Levitt said. “But he has so much fun, all day, every day.”        
The director Gregg Araki showed him that with a labor-of-love project, like the haunting 2005 drama “Mysterious Skin,” meticulous preparation is crucial. Christopher Nolan, who directed him in “The Dark Knight Rises” and “Inception,” shared important technical know-how, like never ever use a tow rig for scenes in cars because the images will end up looking distractingly phony. Mr. Nolan also had another lesson to impart: a little encouragement goes a long way. On the London set of “The Dark Knight Rises,” Mr. Gordon-Levitt told Mr. Nolan he’d just finished the first draft of a script he planned to direct as well as star in.        
“He didn’t laugh at me,” Mr. Gordon-Levitt said. “He just said, ‘Great,’ and then started asking me very detailed questions like, ‘What are you going to shoot it on?’ ”        
Recalling this exchange, Mr. Nolan said, “Joe’s smart, the kind of guy to wear a lot of hats,” then remembered paying a visit to Mr. Gordon-Levitt at Warner Brothers when he was shooting a cafe scene. “There he was, with his trailers and his crew; he seemed at home,” Mr. Nolan said, adding with a laugh: “It turned out he’d gotten a better deal than we were ever offered. I was amazed by this.”        
Back in March, when Mr. Gordon-Levitt, dressed in bluejeans and a striped hoodie, showed up at a coffee shop here in the San Fernando Valley, he didn’t come off as a crafty negotiator. But he did seem as if he were being pulled in a million directions. Midway through ordering, he turned his gaze across the street to his car and he realized he’d forgotten to feed his meter. “I already got a ticket,” he said, sounding downcast but only for a second.        
Given the promising notices that “Don Jon“ received at the Sundance Film Festival in January (when the title was “Don Jon’s Addiction”), it would take more than a parking citation to dampen his great mood. Not only was the movie included in many “best of” Sundance lists, but critics hailed Mr. Gordon-Levitt’s ability to transform his lead character — the brash New Jersey gym rat Jon Martello, who loves scoring babes, bragging about his conquests and stoking his Internet pornography habit — into the warm center of what unexpectedly evolves into a funny-sad coming-of-age tale. “Self-assured“ is how Variety’s Peter Debruge characterized the actor’s filmmaking abilities.        
“One of the things you get from him as a director is a very clear vision,” said Tony Danza, who plays Jon’s oafish father in the film, adding that Mr. Gordon-Levitt’s clarity of focus as a youngster was best explained with an anecdote from 20 years ago. At the time they were both appearing in an update of the 1951 classic “Angels in the Outfield.” One day, Mr. Danza asked Mr. Gordon-Levitt to join him on one of their regular inline-skating excursions around the Oakland Coliseum, and “He told me, ‘No, today I’m going to follow the director around and try and figure out what lens he’s going to use.’ Even as a 12-year-old, he was a serious kid.”        
Now 32, he is no less driven. So he wouldn’t have to cede creative control to a stable of outside financial backers, he carefully conceived the “Don Jon” script to match a spare budget. “I wrote it to not have any explosions or scenes in outer space,” he said.        
He also knew that in-demand talent sometimes forgoes big paychecks in return for the promise of fun or a challenging role. To play his gum-chewing dream girl, Barbara Sugarman, Mr. Gordon-Levitt landed the actress he wrote the part for, Scarlett Johansson, and corralled friends like Anne Hathaway, Channing Tatum and Cuba Gooding Jr. into making self-deprecating cameos.        
The only near hiccup in casting had to do with Julianne Moore, whose turn as an older woman Jon meets at night school becomes the beating heart of the movie. Her agent presented the script as a movie about pornography, but Mr. Gordon-Levitt said that Ms. Moore, who had appeared in “Boogie Nights,” wasn’t interested in another movie on the subject. “Then she read it on a plane,” he continued, “and her husband was sitting next to her and she turned to him and said: ‘This isn’t about porn at all. This is about intimacy and people connecting with each other and relationships.’ ”        
Since 2009, he’s been on a winning streak, appearing in more than a dozen features (“50/50,” “Looper” and “Premium Rush,” to name a few). He’s hosted “Saturday Night Live” twice. At this year’s Academy Awards, he made a pair of high-profile appearances: delivering a nimble soft-shoe with the host, Seth MacFarlane, and Daniel Radcliffe, and photobombing two red-carpet reporters so expertly that it made him an Internet darling.        
Yet wind back about 10 years and you’d find Mr. Gordon-Levitt at a different stage of popularity. In the final season of “3rd Rock From the Sun,” the NBC sci-fi comedy that put him on the map, he asked to be let out of his contract so he could enroll at Columbia University. He enjoyed his book-toting civilian status until, as a 21st birthday present to himself, he bought a copy of the editing software Final Cut Pro. He promptly fell in love.        
“It was like, ‘I could be writing this essay, or cutting this little video I’m starting to make,’ ” said Mr. Gordon-Levitt, who dropped out of Columbia and returned to his native Southern California to start acting again. Though he’d been gone only two years, he was treated like a has-been at auditions.        
“It was a very weird part of his career — people didn’t see him in that movie-star way they see him now,” said Mr. Araki, who was shrewd enough to notice that not only were Mr. Gordon-Levitt’s acting skills intact but that in enlisting him to play a gay rent boy in “Mysterious Skin” he’d also be giving this still-youthful veteran a chance to turn his image on its ear.        
“Normally he was the sidekick or the funny kid,” Mr. Araki said. “This was one of the first times he was cast as the sexy one.”        
What it means to be desirable is just one of the many themes Mr. Gordon-Levitt explores in “Don Jon.” Another is grief, and Mr. Gordon-Levitt admitted that he drew a character’s roiling, unpredictable emotions from what he went through after the 2010 death of his older brother, Daniel. (“It was drug-related, but it was not a drug overdose, as has been falsely reported elsewhere in the press,” Mr. Gordon-Levitt said.) Always close, the two founded HitRECord, a Web site that invites artists from many disciplines — writing, animation, direction, editing — to collaborate on projects.        
Indeed, Mr. Gordon-Levitt’s project after “Don Jon” is “HitRECord on TV,” a variety series starting in January on the cable channel Pivot. In part, it will spotlight live-action and animated shorts produced through the site. Mr. Gordon-Levitt will host. Will it also follow a traditional variety show format? Will there will sketches, cameo appearances, a bit of dance?        
“We’re going to have all those things,” Mr. Gordon-Levitt promised, then offered up “The Muppet Show,” of all things, as a template. “It’s like a variety show, but it’s not a traditional variety show because they’re all Muppets. This will be a variety show, but the difference isn’t Muppets but that it’s all collaboratively made.”        
Somewhere down the line, though, he also plans to make a documentary about Daniel, a professional fire-spinner known as Burning Dan, using the videos, taped conversations and photos that his brother stockpiled on HitRECord. One of Daniel’s favorite things, said Mr. Gordon-Levitt, was to turn on a small digital recorder and just let it run “for hours and hours and hours” as he talked to people.        
“To make all sorts of stuff out of this material,” said Mr. Gordon-Levitt in a low, earnest voice. “It will be a lifelong project for me.”

Loren and Laurel Appleman of Johnstown, Neb. (population 50), were married in 1974, when she was a high school junior. He raises beef cattle, corn and soybeans on their 3,000-acre farm while she runs a quilt shop. They have seven adult children. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.        
How did you meet? 
Laurel: My family moved to Johnstown when I was about 12. My father took me to get some milk at the Applemans’ dairy farm, which is where I met Loren and his sisters.        
Loren: I was 15. We saw each other a lot in church.        
When did the relationship begin to evolve? 
Laurel: By the time I was 14 I was in class with one of his sisters, so we would spend time and he would be there and before long I was spending more time with him than with her.        
Loren: The first time I noticed her I guess was when I went to visit her family’s home for a meal. She was about 14. Within months we started talking about marriage, but it was a year before I asked her folks for their permission to marry.        
You were so young. 
Laurel: On my 16th birthday he asked. My dad said, “Well, you’ll need a house,” thinking that might slow us down. That was in August. By October we had a house and on Nov. 7, 1974, we were married.        
Loren: She had a long weekend break from high school and went back after our honeymoon in Wyoming on Tuesday or Wednesday. The school said she needed an admission slip to get back in class. She wondered who she was supposed to get it from — her husband or her folks.        
Laurel: I wasn’t the only girl in high school who was married, but I was the only one who wasn’t pregnant.        
How did you pay for these things? 
Loren: The wife made her dress and made my sport coat, too. I had gotten a small inheritance from my grandfather than I used to buy the trailer we lived in.        
Laurel: Actually, my mother made my dress, but I did make his jacket. It was this ugly burgundy and cream plaid, but he actually wore it.        
Where did you live? 
Loren: When I was a junior in high school I bought shares of a farm that my grandfather had with two other partners, so I took that responsibility on pretty early. We purchased the trailer and moved it onto the farm. Two years later we moved into a house on the farm, and it’s where we are today.        
Laurel, did you stay in school? 
Laurel: When we decided to get married I doubled up on my classes so I could graduate early.        
And children? 
Loren: By the time she graduated we had our first. Her name was Susan, but she died of crib death. Here was Laurel, just 17 and we already had buried a baby.        
Laurel: We woke up on Father’s Day and she was dead of sudden infant death syndrome. I don’t remember a whole lot, but we were there for each other. We were busy. Loren was still dairying with his dad; that still had to be done twice a day.        
Did you look for a support group? 
Loren: Her sisters and a group of breastfeeding mothers, and we attended church every Sunday.        
Laurel: I worked a bit after Susan passed. I needed a change so I got a part-time job as a cashier in a farm store.        
Did you try again right away? 
Laurel: By New Year’s Day I was in the hospital and had a miscarriage. I told the nurse I didn’t think I would ever have children, but Bryan was born a year and a month later.        
You have seven children. Did you always agree on child rearing? 
Loren: We disagreed some on discipline. I was a little bit more physical with them, which upset her, but we worked through that. I came to realize that a little thump on the head wasn’t necessary.        
Laurel: I don’t have any problem with a swat on the hiney, but his swats were harder. I think he could see that it upset me and he bowed to my request. He was a little hardened. I was an easy sell, so I think we gave them a good balance. We home-schooled them, but in the beginning we didn’t agree on that.        
Why? 
Loren: I thought there was still a stigma to home schooling. There was the idea that the kids wouldn’t get along with other kids or adults and that they wouldn’t know how to interact in a social setting. But it worked. I’ve seen kids from the schools and they don’t know how to interact with anybody, and our kids can talk with people from any generation.

 Bernie Ecclestone, 82, is president and chief executive of Formula One Management and Formula One Administration, which own and operate the Formula One racing series. He also owns a minority stake in the company. After being involved in Formula One on and off during the 1950s and 1960s, Ecclestone has worked full time in the series since the early 1970s, first as owner of the Brabham team and then as the series promoter. Since the 1980s, he has become the sole promoter of the business of Formula One, selling television and other promotional rights and negotiating races around the world with circuit owners. He has also been involved in several sales of the series, culminating in the sale in 2005 to CVC Capital Partners, a private equity firm. Ecclestone spoke recently in the motor home that he uses as a headquarters at Grands Prix races with John F. Burns of The New York Times and Brad Spurgeon of the International Herald Tribune. 


Q. There has been quite a lot of nervousness about the state of some of the Formula One teams, and whether they are financially viable.  
A. How long have I been, really, in Formula One running the teams? 1970? Myself, when I had money invested — nothing’s changed — Frank Williams [owner of the Williams team] used to come and borrow money from me to pay for his engine bills.        
Nothing’s changed. You go back to the Brabham days, when I really got involved in things. Dear old Frank used to come and borrow money, and he paid it back right on the dot. That’s how it was. There have been very rich teams, and teams that are struggling. Nothing’s changed. Just the amounts have gone up. The principles have all been the same. Formula One team owners always spend more than they’ve got. And they have to find the money.        
Q. Would it be accurate to say that there was more turnover of teams in the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s than there has been in the past 20 years? 
A. Yes. I was looking the other day, and I think since 1950 when the championship started, I think there have been 54 teams in Formula One. We’re 10 now. Ferrari have been around, Frank’s been with us, McLaren’s been with us — the others have come and gone.        
Q. The critics say there are not enough teams, that half of the teams are in a very parlous financial state. And then there are more complicated questions about CVC (the venture capital company that owns a controlling stake in Formula One) and the division of revenues between CVC and the teams.   
A. Of which they get 62 percent. The difference is, we control what we spend, and they can’t. Because if you look at it, very few of them are business people. If you look at their history and what they’ve done, it’s pretty clear. They spend too much, it’s as simple as that. All of the teams in Formula One, including the ones at the back of the grid, could and should be making a very good profit. I can’t help them. If you give all of them 25 percent more next year, you’d be sitting here with me at the end of next year with the same stories.        
Q. I’m not aware of any other sport, or indeed of any other enterprise, where the control of the commercial rights has been tied up in a contract lasting for a century or more, as it was in your 1999 agreement with the International Automobile Federation for the rights to Formula One. And some people say there should never have been a 100-year contract, that too much power is invested in you.  
A. Everybody is entitled to their opinion. There’s not much I can do about it. It’s because we’ve got a 100-year agreement that people can count on benefiting from what we receive now. If we didn’t have any agreements, it would be back to the old days when I pulled things together, when they wouldn’t know what they were going to get race by race. I used to go and collect the start money for Vanwall [team], and negotiate the start money, which they didn’t know they were going to get.        
Q. You are referred to as the tsar, the dictator and so forth. Do you see yourself as a dictator? 
A. No, I regard myself as being very lucky. I’m 83 years old — I am not 83, I hope I will be 83 years old — and I’m still alive and well, and hopefully can still manage our companies.        
Q. Does it worry you that people look at you and see you as being the tsar, the single dominant figure who controls the finances, who heavily influences every aspect of the sport? There can’t be too many people who have ever held a position in a sport such as you have now. 
A. I don’t know. I’m sure there has been. I’ve never thought about it like that. I’m doing a job, and I do the best job I can do. If you tried to run this whole business democratically, it wouldn’t work. Half of the people don’t agree with each other anyway. To get something done it would take two months where we need an answer in two days.        
Q. Stirling Moss was quoted recently as saying that you are the man he most admires, for what you’ve achieved in Formula One. Who is the person whom you most admire? 
A. Oh, in our business, I had a lot of respect for, obviously because he helped me a lot, (Enzo) Ferrari, Colin Chapman, people who go back a long way with me and were very supportive and very helpful, so I have a lot of admiration for them.        
Q. You are renowned as being a man who doesn’t have many foibles of the tabloid press kind; you are not seen squiring around young  women, you don’t seem to have a taste for superfast cars, and this is the most modest motor home in the Formula One paddock.  
A. I like to think that I’m very practical. This [motor home] does exactly what we need. I’ve always got too many things to do. So many things I want to finish, they keep piling up, and never get finished.        
Q. What do you want to do? What do you want to do with Formula One? 
A. There’s lot’s of different things. Don’t forget that our business is a business that really is very technical. The cars are technical. I’m not too excited about the current regulations.        
Q. The new ones?  
A. Yes, the new ones.        
Q. So why did you allow that to happen?  
A. Because I’m not a dictator. The one that could have stopped it, really, was Ferrari. Ferrari had a veto over a lot of these changes when they were made, and they didn’t veto it. If they had, I’d have completely supported it. But as they didn’t …        
Q.  If you were a correspondent interviewing the tsar of all motor racing, what would you ask him? 
A. I’d say, “Can I leave?”

Few of the races in the Formula One global expansion in the last 15 years have garnered as much respect and generated as much anticipation as the Singapore Grand Prix, which runs its sixth edition this weekend.        


That’s not surprising, given that there is really no other race like it, from the stunning location of the street circuit through the city’s skyscrapers and monuments to the competition being the only night Grand Prix on the calendar to a track that many consider the season’s most gruelling, or at least most unrelenting. The heat and humidity are matched only by that of the race in neighboring Malaysia.        
“Singapore is an incredible race,” said Christian Horner, the director of the Red Bull team, whose driver Sebastian Vettel won the event last year. “It’s a great challenge for the drivers, it’s the most physical and the most mechanically demanding race on the calendar now, and always lasting two hours in duration.”        
“It has established itself as one of the highlights on the calendar, and we’re always delighted to be going back there,” he added.        
The Singapore Prix has also been the scene of several controversies, scandals and major changes for the series. At the inaugural race in the city-state, in September 2008, the series faced the news of the global financial crisis. The next year, the paddock was abuzz with the revelation that during that first edition a team had staged an accident by one of its drivers, which led to victory by the team’s other driver.        
While the world title has never been decided in Singapore, the race has frequently been pivotal in establishing the order at the top heading into the season’s final races.        
Many Ferrari supporters, for instance, pointed to that infamous 2008 race, won by Fernando Alonso after his teammate intentionally crashed, as a crucial moment that cost Ferrari’s Felipe Massa the title in the last race of the year, which he won in Brazil but lost the title to Lewis Hamilton by a single point.        
Last year, it turned out to be the turning point in Vettel’s season. His victory in Singapore was only his second of the season, but he went on to win the next three races, wiping out what had seemed to be Alonso’s seemingly insurmountable lead and winning his third drivers’ title in a row.        
It was Vettel himself who best summed up the gruelling challenge last year after he won the race.        
“It’s one of the toughest races of the year, to be honest,” Vettel said. “It’s very long, the full two hours. There’s no space for mistakes and the race just seems to go on forever.”        
The list of unique challenges on the track is long: It is a street circuit, like in Monaco, but in Singapore it is possible to overtake other cars; there are extremely high temperatures and strong humidity; the race is run at night, and it is far from the European home base of Formula One.        
The doctor who works with the drivers at the Red Bull team, Riccardo Ceccarelli, said that the Singapore race is probably the most demanding race physically and mentally.        
“It’s like Monaco for the concentration, it’s like Malaysia for the heat and humidity, and then it’s at night, so it is even more difficult,” Ceccarelli said.        
It is also the first of the season’s remaining seven races, which are all held far from Europe, within a two-month period. The season ends in São Paulo on Nov. 24, having stopped on the way in South Korea, Japan, India, Abu Dhabi and the United States.        
In terms of the pure spectacle of the event, Singapore beats all the new races, although partly by drawing on the age-old formula. With its race designed as the Monaco Grand Prix of Asia, Singapore is a high-flying business center with a few classic colonial vestiges dotting the landscape: St. Andrew’s Cathedral, City Hall, the Supreme Court and the Esplanade Bridge. And the landmark Raffles Hotel is, of course, not far off.        
Running the race at night proved to be such a success that other circuits have either imitated it or said they will. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix runs partly in daylight and partly after nightfall; the Malaysian Grand Prix opted for a later afternoon start but without artificial lighting; and the promoters in Bahrain announced this month that they intend to run their race at night next year, after installing a lighting system.

Saudi Arabia appears resolute: It wants Bashar al-Assad out of Damascus. The Saudis view the fighting in Syria with the same intensity that they did the civil war in Yemen that raged in the 1960s — as a conflict with wide and serious repercussions that will shape the political trajectory of the Middle East for years to come.        


The Syrian war presents the Saudis with a chance to hit three birds with one stone: Iran, its rival for regional dominance, Tehran’s ally Assad, and his Hezbollah supporters. But Riyadh’s policy makers are wary. They know that once fully committed, it will be difficult to disengage. And so they are taking to heart the lessons of another regional war that flared on their border 50 years ago.        
The war in Yemen that broke out in 1962 when military leaders ousted the centuries-old monarchy and declared a republic quickly turned into a quagmire that sucked in foreign powers. The Soviet Union provided the new regime with air support. British airstrikes aided the royalists and the United States offered warplanes in a symbolic show of force.        
More than anything else though, the conflict became a proxy war between Saudi Arabia, which backed the deposed imam and his royalist supporters, and Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser, who supported the new republic. Nasser’s vision of a united Arab “nation” free of Western domination and sterile monarchies resonated across the Arab world. The Saudi monarchy, wary of this republican fever on its border, decided it was not going to stand on the sidelines. The kingdom used all available means to try to check Nasser’s ambitions — but it did not send troops.        
By some estimates, Egypt sent as many as 55,000 troops to Yemen, some of whom became involved in fighting well inside Saudi territory, while others were accused of using chemical weapons supplied by the Soviet Union. Saudi Arabia provided money and weapons to the royalists. Yet neither side achieved its goals. Egypt’s war with Israel in 1967 led Nasser to withdraw his forces, but the Saudis were unable to turn the tide. Riyadh was eventually forced to recognize Yemen’s republican government.        
Now as then, Riyadh sees the struggle in Syria as a defining moment. As the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, it perceives an opportunity to check what it sees as Iranian plans to encircle the kingdom with hostile Shiite-dominated regimes. As the war has taken on a more sectarian character, the usually reserved foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, has described Assad’s onslaught against his own people as “genocide” and Syrian lands as being “under occupation” — a clear reference to the presence of Iranian and Hezbollah forces.        
It is no secret that the Saudis are supplying elements of the Syrian opposition with weapons. They all but admitted as much when the prince said a few weeks ago that “if the international community is not willing to do anything, then they must allow Syrians to defend themselves.”        
The Saudis will use all tools available to oust Assad, while taking measures to ensure that the weapons they’re supplying to the rebels do not fall into the hands of extremists. Nevertheless, following the chemical attack on civilians near Damascus last month, the Saudi foreign minister spoke candidly about the inability of the Arab nations to put a stop to Assad’s campaign through force of arms, adding that any military effort to do so would likely involve actors outside the region. Recent suggestions that the Arab League should assemble a military force to check Assad’s aggression do not seem viable. Disagreements among the league’s member nations have prevented it from agreeing to even endorse a potential U.S. strike.        
But on Monday, the Saudi Council of Ministers issued a strong statement making clear that it considered preventing another chemical attack by Assad to be only a short-term goal. In the long-term, he must be ousted.        
Saudi Arabia will intensify its efforts to arm the rebels and to use its media outlets and diplomatic clout to rally support for a military strike. Although the kingdom is known for using its troops sparingly, it has done so judiciously in the past. Riyadh did, for example, send troops to Bahrain to show its support for the Sunni regime in the face of extended mass protests. Of course, Syria is not Bahrain, but neither is Saudi Arabia the same country that it was in the 1960s, when it failed to achieve its goals in Yemen.        
The oil-rich kingdom of today wields far greater influence than it did half a century ago. There is no question that it will wield that influence forcefully, supporting the rebels with guns and diplomacy as it struggles to outmaneuver Iran, outflank Hezbollah and oust Assad.

WASHINGTON — The extraordinary zeal of the Tea Party has been a signature development during Barack Obama’s presidency — with dangers for both Republicans and Democrats.        


Its white-hot opposition to Mr. Obama, seen first in lawmakers’ town hall meetings and then in the 2010 midterm election campaign, helped cost Democrats control of the House. It could yet help Republicans hold their majority in 2014.        
The downside for Republican leaders occurs when that political energy propels the party to places that make it harder to win general elections and to govern. Just as Mitt Romney struggled to avoid getting dragged too far right in the 2012 presidential race, Speaker John A. Boehner struggled this week to steer his caucus away from what could be an economically and politically catastrophic government shutdown.        
But some Republican politicians display an ability to absorb the heat and reflect it back in more politically promising directions. That’s why 2016 presidential hopefuls and House leaders could learn from recent town meetings conducted by Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma.        
Mr. Cole, a House deputy whip and a former chief of staff for the Republican National Committee, represents a district that voted two-to-one Republican in the last three presidential elections. Since first winning his southwest Oklahoma seat in 2002, he has never drawn less than 60 percent of the vote.        
What dominated his sessions with constituents was, as one man in Midwest City described it, “a sense of outrage about our government.” Mr. Cole embraced the ideological touchstones of his constituents: He said he was “violently opposed” to the new health care law, extolled his National Rifle Association membership and noted that “I’ve never voted for Planned Parenthood in my life.”        
Yet Mr. Cole also challenged unhappy constituents on tactics, tone and spirit. If replicated effectively on Capitol Hill and the 2016 presidential campaign trail, those three guideposts could be a path toward expanding the party’s appeal:        
■ Realism. Some Congressional colleagues indulge the illusions of the party’s most fervent activists, producing legislative demands that Mr. Boehner simply cannot meet. Mr. Cole did not.        
For constituents urging a government shutdown over the health care law, he warned that it would doubly backfire by hurting local residents like the workers at nearby Tinker Air Force Base, and by heaping blame on Republicans. A party controlling neither the White House nor the Senate, he said, lacks the power to reverse a White House incumbent’s foremost domestic achievement, no matter how often the House votes to do so.        
“It’s awfully hard to repeal Obamacare when a guy named Obama is president of the United States,” he said. “We’re in a position to stop a lot of what he wants to do. We’re not in a position to undo.”        
On the nation’s long-term budget woes, he encouraged constituents to refocus their concerns away from emotion-charged but comparatively tiny accounts like foreign aid and toward the vast entitlement programs benefiting them and their friends and neighbors.        
At a meeting in Moore, one elderly man complained about the idea of reining in Social Security by applying the “chained Consumer Price Index” to benefit calculations. Instead, the man asked, “Why don’t you put that chain on the spending?”        
That, of course, is exactly what the chained-C.P.I. proposal would do. “Those things are going to be on the table,” Mr. Cole told him, noting that popular programs like Social Security and Medicare make up 60 percent of the budget.        
“It’s pretty easy to tell people what they want to hear,” Mr. Cole said in Midwest City, adding a barb for some of his colleagues: “There’s a certain amount of that going on in the Republican Party right now, at a very high level.”        
■ Respect. A recurrent theme on the Republican right is the illegitimacy of opponents. Some accuse Democrats of profiting from vote fraud. Others, like Mr. Romney in his famous “47 percent” remarks, insist that large numbers of Democrats have grown enfeebled by reliance on government programs.        
Mr. Cole sounded different notes. Instead of deriding political adversaries, he acknowledged their strength and grit.

SANA, Yemen — At least 21 government soldiers were killed on Friday in what appeared to be coordinated attacks by people suspected of being Qaeda militants on two military targets in the south of Yemen, government officials said. Earlier in the day, witnesses and local security officials gave a higher death toll, saying at least 33 soldiers were killed.        


In an official statement issued Friday afternoon, the government said that in the first attack, gunmen opened fire at security headquarters in the town of Mayfaa. That was followed by the explosion of two car bombs at a military camp in Al Nashama, the statement said. Both attacks left a total of 21 soldiers dead and 15 injured, the government said.        
But security officials on the scene and residents who said they had seen the bodies disputed that number, saying at least 25 soldiers had been killed in the car bomb explosions and at least 8 in the shootings.        
All of those killed had been assigned to guard the oil and gas fields in southern Shabwa Province, a volatile area and stronghold of Al Qaeda, where there have been frequent skirmishes between security forces and Islamist militants.        
The officials said they believed that members of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Qaeda affiliate active in Yemen, were responsible for the attacks. The United States and other Western countries view the group as one of the most dangerous affiliates of the global terrorism network. In recent years, the group has tried to carry out several high-profile attacks, some meant to blow up international airliners, and its militants have assassinated dozens of Yemeni security and military officers.        
The Associated Press, quoting Maj. Raed Mohammed Nasser, said eight militants had died.        
Residents who said they had witnessed the attack in Mayfaa reported that the militants had surprised the troops in their barracks at dawn in dense fog.        
Witnesses in the area near Al Nashama, which is about 40 miles from Mayfaa, said that after the bombs had detonated, a drone had targeted the two Qaeda cars, hitting one and missing the other. They said no bodies had been discovered in the cars. Before the attack, the witnesses said, Qaeda militants were seen driving through the surrounding area, armed with machine guns.        
A campaign of American drone strikes and a Yemeni Army offensive have intensified pressure against the Qaeda affiliate over the past 18 months, as militants have been pushed out of territory that had been under their control and back into hiding. But despite that pressure, the group has been at the center of a recent intensification in threat levels. 
Last month, the Obama administration closed nearly two dozen diplomatic missions and issued a worldwide travel alert after the United States intercepted electronic communications in which the head of Al Qaeda ordered the leader of the Yemen affiliate to carry out an attack, American officials have said.

Nielsen, playing catch-up, has a plan to start incorporating some viewership of television shows on phones and tablets into its industry-standard TV ratings system in the fall of 2014.         
The company’s plan, previewed in news reports on Thursday, will be formally announced next week at the Advertising Week conference in New York. It is a response to the requests — and sometimes outright pleas — from networks for a more complete accounting of viewership.        
While most TV consumption still happens through traditional TV sets, more and more people are watching on other screens, like smartphones. Networks have been pressuring Nielsen to include those people in the ratings reports that calibrate advertising rates and influence the perceptions of success and failure.        
So Nielsen will, but not until this time next year. The company said that was a reflection of the extensive behind-the-scenes work that is required.        
By revealing the timeline now, at the start of the fall season, Nielsen may be trying to calm the nerves of clients.        
Nielsen executives were not available for interviews on Thursday afternoon. But in a previously-scheduled interview with Variety, the company’s senior vice president for global audience measurement, Eric Solomon, acknowledged that networks “are starving for a number they can publish that really represents their audience not just on TV but across all platforms.”        
Once some mobile viewing is included in the ratings totals, Mr. Solomon said: “I think it will start changing the narrative that people are not watching TV shows. It’s that they’re watching on different platforms.”        
Because Nielsen ratings exist mainly for the buying and selling of TV advertising time, the expansion plan does not include ad-free streaming services like Netflix, which mainly carries previous seasons of shows. Nor does the plan initially include Hulu, the streaming service jointly owned by the parent companies of ABC, Fox and NBC, because the ads that are streamed on Hulu differ from the ads on TV.        
But Nielsen will measure online streams of shows that have exactly the same ads in the same order as the TV broadcasts of those shows. For example, people who watch “Scandal” via ABC’s streaming app or Time Warner Cable’s app would be newly counted in Nielsen’s TV ratings. People who watch “Scandal” via Netflix or Hulu would not.        
Will Somers, the head of research at Fox, was encouraged by Nielsen’s plan. But like his counterparts at other networks, he hinted at a little impatience: he said Fox hoped Nielsen “can bring comprehensive and scalable multiplatform measurement services to market as quickly as possible.”

JAKARTA — Indonesia and India, the two emerging markets hardest hit in recent weeks by falling currencies and other financial troubles, took opposite tracks on Friday as both countries struggled to balance growth with the threat of inflation.        


In an interview here, the vice president of Indonesia characterized higher interest rates and a weakened currency as the “new normal.” Boediono, the country’s vice president, who uses only one name, said that Indonesia would face a tougher international financial environment in the coming months and should give greater emphasis to a stable currency, stable prices and a stable trade balance and not just pursue economic growth.        
“We have been addicted, so to speak, with an easy-money environment for four years,” said Mr. Boediono, the main architect of Indonesian economic policy since the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998. “We know that we have to make some adjustments, and maybe by next year, we have to really, fully adjust to a new normal, so to speak, where easy money is no longer” available.        
But in Mumbai, the new governor of the Reserve Bank of India suggested that India faced less of an international threat after the Federal Reserve decided on Wednesday to continue its economic stimulus, at least temporarily. The governor, Raghuram Rajan, lowered a key interest rate on Friday by three-quarters of a percent, although he raised another less important rate by a quarter of a percent.        
India pushed interest rates up sharply over the summer to make financial investments there more attractive and slow the fall of the rupee. Reversing part of that increase now “will provide a boost to growth, reduce the financing distortions that are emerging in the market, and reduce the strain on corporate and bank balance sheets,” Raghuram Rajan, the new governor, said Friday at his first news conference on monetary policy.        
In monetary terms, India is zigging while Indonesia is zagging, despite the many common challenges that have pummeled their currencies and stock markets in recent weeks. Both must balance a need to preserve economic growth for large, heavily poor populations, while at the same time preventing a buildup of inflation that might discourage longer-term investments — a tricky balancing act that has bedeviled policy makers in the United States and other affluent countries over the years.        
India, with a population of about 1.2 billion, and Indonesia, population 250 million, are both struggling to modernize their infrastructure while stuck with complex land ownership laws that make it hard to redevelop cities rapidly. Both are wrestling with costly but politically popular fuel subsidies that are driving up government budget deficits, and both have indignant publics demanding an end to endemic corruption.        
Economically, both have sizable current-account deficits compared to their economic output, together with nearly double-digit inflation in consumer prices.        
Perhaps most important, both face national elections next year that limit their ability to make politically unappetizing economic decisions: India will elect a new Parliament by the end of May, while Indonesia will elect a new legislature in April and a new president in July.        
The different policies outlined on Friday in Jakarta and Mumbai reflect differences in the seriousness of their predicaments, however, with India appearing to be in considerably worse shape.        
While Indonesia’s ports and highways still have shortcomings, as does the country’s bureaucracy, they are good enough that the country has emerged as one destination for the many companies shifting operations away from China in response to surging blue-collar wages there. India’s bureaucracy remains stifling, and the potholes and traffic on the country’s roads are so bad that vehicles scarcely move faster than walking speed in some areas; in other areas, sometime gruesome crashes are a regular occurrence.

“You’re picking him up too much.”        


“Are you nursing the baby again? You’ll spoil her!”        
“Cloth diapers? The whole reason someone invented disposables was so we wouldn’t have to deal with those!”        
“Are you sure that soy formula is enough for him? He keeps crying.”        
There is nothing like the arrival of a baby to crystallize the child-rearing views of everyone around a new parent — especially the views of that parent’s own parents, or parents-in-law. Suddenly, everyone knows exactly how it should be done (whatever “it” is). At the very least, they certainly know how they did it — or how they remember doing it, which I’ve always suspected is a very different thing.        
In this installment of the “New Parent, Old Parent” partnership between the Booming and Motherlode blogs, I, the New Parent, am asking the question: What’s a new parent to do when the grandparents give too much advice about the baby?        
If a new mother nurses when her own mother used formula, or a new father carries a baby in a sling while the stroller was good enough for his dad, it’s not always a simple case of “different people do things differently.” When we new parents do things differently, our parents might feel judged — are we rejecting the way we were raised? Or they might have safety fears — is the sling safe? Is soy formula really as good as dairy? The results can range from mild discord to the kind of things some new parents would consider unforgivable, like slipping a breastfed baby a bottle of formula, or skipping the car seat for “just a short ride” (there are still some grandparents out there who consider their arms safer than the Britax).        
But from the grandparents’ point of view, why not share the lessons learned in the many years of parenting that led to this moment: their child, holding their grandchild? There is nothing more frustrating than watching your sleepless son or daughter reinvent the wheel when you’re certain you could help get that baby sleeping more soundly, or at least more often. In fact, isn’t that the point of “New Parent, Old Parent” — to share that cross-generational wisdom? It is, but we note that it’s far, far easier to take advice when those giving the advice didn’t bring years of family baggage along and settle down in the guest room.        
As when we asked what you did when your child wouldn’t go to school, we’re asking boomer parents who have seen this through to exchange ideas with Motherlode parents who are in the thick of it.        
If you’ve survived the generational disputes that are so often part of the territory for new parents and grandparents, please tell us how you smiled, nodded and went your own way — or managed to tell your mother to take her formula stash back to the store. And if you’ve been on the grandparent end, and emerged with your relationships with your children and their spouses intact, what was the secret to raising your children through their own entry into parenthood?        
Please share your thoughts in the comments section, and I’ll round up some of the most intriguing responses (and maybe a few of the best stories) and post them on Motherlode next Friday. Then, the following week, I’ll pass the baton back to my Old Parent colleague, Michael Winerip.

WASHINGTON — As the Obama administration embarks on a highly visible diplomatic overture to Iran, White House officials are engaged in a quieter, behind-the-scenes effort to reassure Israel that they will not fall for the charms of Iran’s new president by prematurely easing pressure on his government to curb its nuclear program.        


In private conversations with Israeli officials and a few public statements, administration officials have emphasized that they remain skeptical of Iran’s intentions on the nuclear program, and that they will judge Iran by its actions, not by the conciliatory words of its newly elected president, Hassan Rouhani. In advance of his arrival in New York next week for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Rouhani has signaled a willingness to negotiate an agreement over the future of Iran’s nuclear program.        
But the White House’s reassurances did not prevent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel from issuing a harsh condemnation of Mr. Rouhani this week, presaging a potential showdown with President Obama over how to deal with Iran, after a period in which the two leaders appeared finally to be in sync.        
Amid news of an exchange of letters between Mr. Obama and Mr. Rouhani, and fresh discussion in Washington of negotiations that could lift sanctions against Iran, Mr. Netanyahu’s office dismissed as “media spin” a raft of statements by Mr. Rouhani about the peaceful goals of Iran’s nuclear program and his willingness to engage in diplomacy.        
“There is no need to be fooled by the words,” said a lengthy Israeli statement issued late Thursday in response to Mr. Rouhani’s NBC News interview. “The test is not in what Rouhani says, but in the deeds of the Iranian regime, which continues to advance its nuclear program with vigor while Rouhani is being interviewed.”        
Mr. Netanyahu, who has described Mr. Rouhani as a “wolf in sheep’s clothing,” has stepped up his longstanding campaign against Iranian nuclear development in recent days, and plans to make it the focus of a meeting with Mr. Obama in Washington on Sept. 30 and a speech to the General Assembly the next day.        
While American officials have repeatedly told their Israeli counterparts that they would be cautious in their dealings with the Iranian president, the White House has also made clear that it has an obligation to test whether Mr. Rouhani’s expressions of interest in diplomacy are genuine.        
“We certainly recognize and appreciate Israel’s significant concerns about Iran, given the threats that have been made against Israel and the outrageous comments that have come out of Iran for many years about Israel,” Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, told reporters on Friday, previewing the message that Mr. Obama will deliver to the United Nations next Tuesday, a week earlier than Mr. Netanyahu.        
“There’s not an open-ended window for diplomacy,” Mr. Rhodes said. “But we do believe there is time and space for diplomacy.”        
Washington and Jerusalem both want to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but have often disagreed on the timetable and strategy for doing so. Israel, which sees a nuclear Iran as a dire threat to its existence, has pressed for a more forceful military threat. The United States, while stressing that all options are on the table, has urged Israel to give diplomacy and sanctions more time.        
Mr. Rouhani’s election has clearly intrigued the White House. Senior officials said that unlike his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, he seemed to have the authority from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to negotiate on the nuclear issue. He also has a broad political mandate in Iran, officials said.        
“It’s certainly different perspectives looking at the same picture,” said Dore Gold, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and a former Netanyahu aide. “Israel is clearly focused on Iranian action, and the messages in Washington seem more hopeful about Iranian intentions.”        
Since Mr. Netanyahu’s United Nations speech last year laying out his red lines on Iran, and especially since Mr. Obama’s visit to Israel in March, the two countries have seemed in alignment. But many Israeli leaders and analysts saw Mr. Obama’s zigzag response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons as a bad omen for his resolve in stopping Iran.

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Friday announced that it was not backing down from a confrontation with the coal industry and that it would press ahead with enacting the first federal carbon limits on the nation’s power companies.        


The proposed regulations, announced at the National Press Club by Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, are an aggressive move by Mr. Obama to bypass Congress on climate change with executive actions he promised in his inaugural address this year. The regulations are certain to be denounced by House Republicans and the industry as part of what they call the president’s “war on coal.”        
In her speech, Ms. McCarthy unveiled the agency’s proposal to limit new gas-fired power plants to 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt-hour and new coal plants to 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide. Industry officials say the average advanced coal plant currently emits about 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour.        
“The president’s Climate Action Plan calls on federal agencies to take steady, sensible, and pragmatic steps to cut the harmful carbon pollution that fuels our changing climate, to prepare our communities for its unavoidable impacts, while continuing to provide affordable and reliable energy for all,” Ms. McCarthy said.        
Opponents of the new E.P.A. rule quickly vowed to take measures to stop it. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader who is from coal-dependent Kentucky, promised to use his legislative skills to prevent the measure.        
“The president’s decision today is an escalation of the war on coal and what that really means for Kentucky families is an escalation of his war on jobs and the Kentucky economy,” Mr. McConnell said. “I will file a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to ensure a vote to stop this devastating E.P.A. rule.”        
Ms. McCarthy also announced a yearlong schedule for an environmental listening tour — a series of meetings across the country with the public, the industry and environmental groups as the agency works to establish emissions limits on existing power plants — a far more costly and controversial step. Mr. Obama has told officials he wants to see greenhouse gas limits on existing and new power plants by the time he leaves office in 2017.        
“We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,” Mr. Obama said in January. But he acknowledged that “the path toward sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult.”        
On Friday, Ms. McCarthy said: “We have proven time after time that setting fair Clean Air Act standards to protect public health does not cause the sky to fall. The economy does not crumble.”        
She also said: “The overwhelming judgment of science tells us that climate change is real, human activities are fueling that change, and we must take action to avoid the most devastating consequences. We know this is not just about melting glaciers. Climate change — caused by carbon pollution — is one of the most significant public health threats of our time. That’s why E.P.A. has been called to action. And that’s why today’s action is so important for us to talk about.”        
The limits unveiled on Friday are a slightly more relaxed standard for coal plants than the administration first proposed in April 2012. Officials said the new plan, which came after the E.P.A. received more than 2.5 million comments from the public and industry, will give coal plant operators more flexibility to meet the limits over several years.        
The rules on new power plants will soon face a 60-day public comment period, likely to be followed by intensive industry and environmental lobbying and possible court challenges. Officials said the rules could be finalized by the fall of 2014.        
Once the rules are in place, coal power plants will be required to limit their emissions, likely by installing technology called “carbon capture and sequestration,” which scrubs carbon dioxide from their emissions before they reach the plant smokestacks. The technology then pumps it into permanent storage underground.        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 20, 2013An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from the average advanced coal plant. It is 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour, not 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per hour.

Stocks fell on Friday as investors puzzled over the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain its stimulus measures as they heard opposing viewpoints from top Fed officials.         
Despite lower closes in the last two sessions, the major stock indexes ended higher for the week. The Dow rose 0.6 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 1.3 percent. The Nasdaq advanced 1.4 percent.        
On Wednesday, the Fed surprised economists and investors with its decision to delay scaling back its stimulus.        
James B. Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, who was interviewed on Bloomberg TV, said a reduction of the Fed’s $85 billion monthly bond purchase program beginning in October was possible. Mr. Bullard later said in New York that low inflation meant the Fed could be patient in deciding when to scale back the pace of asset purchases.        
But the president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, Esther L. George, sharply criticized her colleagues’ decision this week not to reduce the bond-buying program, warning that it sowed confusion and risked the central bank’s credibility given the markets’ conviction that the policy would be adjusted.        
“The market will view this as a bad move on their part,” said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management in San Francisco, referring to the Fed, “and we are already seeing that today.” He added, “It is also a reflection on what the Fed didn’t do and some disappointment with that.” During the Fed discussion, two companies made their first stock market appearances with stellar results. New offerings by the Internet security company FireEye opened 101.5 percent above the initial offer price at $40.30, and closed up 80 percent at $36. The ad technology company Rocket Fuel also soared, more than doubling at its opening and ending the session up 93.4 percent at $56.10.        
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 185.46 points, or 1.19 percent, to 15,451.09, the S.& P. 500 lost 12.42 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,709.91 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 14.66 points, or 0.39 percent, to 3,774.73.        
Caterpillar was one of the biggest drags on the Dow, down 3.4 percent, to $84.75. The company, a maker of heavy machinery, reported disappointing sales for the three-month rolling period ending in August.        
Shares of BlackBerry listed in the United States plunged 17.1 percent to $8.73 after the struggling smartphone maker said it would cut 4,500 jobs and that it would badly miss Wall Street’s second-quarter expectations.        
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32, to 97 31/32, with the yield at 2.74 percent, down from 2.75 percent on Thursday.

The energy that characterizes New York City finds artistic release in dance. Other cities around the world have important dance scenes, but for diversity and vitality this one has no match. Here ballet and modern mingle with tap and jazz. Here ethnic and experimental mixed media works find devoted audiences. Here it’s natural to find the formal colliding with the forward-looking. And during the main season, from September to June, it’s not unusual to find a dozen dance productions opening in a week.        


In that spirit, we present 10 professionals who, working offstage or on, embody this range — from tap to ballet, flamenco to postmodern. Each, in a different way, makes New York’s dance scene singular.        
Sara Mearns, a stage animal of rare vibrancy, is changing our idea of how a ballerina looks and projects. Judy Hussie-Taylor, executive director at the Danspace Project at St. Mark’s, is reshaping the course of modern dance. Alexei Ratmansky, formerly artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow, choreographs around the globe, but it’s here that his most adventurous pieces have had their premieres. An important part of New York culture is the way it keeps drawing — and inspiring — dance artists from abroad.        
Everyone on this list has become integral to this city’s dance life — and between now and year’s end, the work of each one can be seen in New York. Perhaps only a few, like the Alvin Ailey dancer Matthew Rushing, have reached full maturity. The others — even Ms. Mearns and Mr. Ratmansky — are still evolving. It’s exciting to think that yet finer work lies ahead.        Andrea Mohin/The New York TimesAlexei Ratmansky "

LONDON — Three of the biggest British department store chains were accused Friday of colluding on prices with a maker of sports bras.         
The Office of Fair Trading, a British competition regulator, alleged that the chains — John Lewis, Debenhams and House of Fraser — were involved in price-fixing with a bra manufacturer, DB Apparel, in violation of competition law.        
DB Apparel, a private company based in France, entered into several agreements with the stores to set a minimum resale price for its Shock Absorber brand of sports bras between 2008 and 2011, the O.F.T. alleged.        
“The O.F.T. takes allegations of price-fixing seriously,” Ann Pope, a senior director at the regulator, said in a statement. “Resale price maintenance limits competition between retailers and can lead to consumers paying higher prices.”        
DBA’s Shock Absorber sports bra range, which in 2000 featured the tennis player Anna Kournikova in an advertising campaign with the slogan “Only the ball should bounce,” was one of the top-selling brands in Britain, with a market share of 15 percent during the years in question, the O.F.T. said.        
The four companies have until November to reply to the accusations. The O.F.T. is then expected to reach a final decision next year and could impose fines of up to 10 percent of the companies’ worldwide revenue.        
The British underwear market grew 1.5 percent to about 2.7 billion pounds, or $4.3 billion, last year, according to the market research company Mintel. Growth continues to be subdued and competition high “as a result of the wide availability of low-priced” goods, Mintel said in a report in June.        
DB Apparel said it rejected any allegations by the O.F.T. “We have been transparent with U.K. authorities since the beginning of this process and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this investigation,” the company said.        
A statement from John Lewis said the company would cooperate fully in the investigation. Clotilde Gros, a spokeswoman for House of Fraser, said it was cooperating and was “confident that we have been operating within all laws and regulations.”        
Debenhams said it rejected the O.F.T. findings but would not comment further. “The matter is being dealt with by its external lawyers,” the company said.        
DB Apparel manufactures and distributes branded underwear mainly in Europe but also in Russia and Africa. Its other brands include Wonderbra, Fila and Unno.        
The department stores sell clothes, personal-care products and some furniture and electronics to Britain’s middle class. All three have multistory flagship stores on London’s Oxford Street, the capital’s main shopping avenue.        
Debenhams, which started as a haberdashery in London in 1778, now has 240 stores in 28 countries. It said earlier this week that year-over-year sales for the 12 months that ended on Aug. 31 rose 2 percent. The company is to report more detailed earnings next month. Its shares fell 1.4 percent by midday on Friday in London.        
House of Fraser has 61 stores in Britain and Ireland and annual sales of 1.2 billion pounds. The company, which is privately held, reported a loss for the 12 months that ended on Jan. 26.        
John Lewis is mainly owned by its employees through a partnership structure and is the smallest department store chain of the three by number of stores. The company, which was founded by John Spedan Lewis in 1864, also owns Waitrose, a relatively upmarket grocery store chain. The 39 John Lewis shops and 297 Waitrose stores had annual sales of more than 9.5 billion pounds last year.

The waning days of any political administration are typically given over, in large part, to a trumpeting of its successes, real and perceived, and so it has been in New York, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg prepares to depart with all the reluctance of a 6-year-old leaving Great Adventure.        


Last week, city officials invited reporters on a tour of more than 20 schools that ranked highly on state tests last spring to show that the Education Department has done a better job than many believe. Two days later, the mayor announced plans for a huge development on the Lower East Side,  to include affordable housing, unaffordable housing, a bowling alley and an Andy Warhol museum.        
For its part, the Taxi and Limousine Commission offered rides in the Taxi of Tomorrow, a model of which had just arrived at Kennedy Airport from a plant in Mexico. The cab, a Nissan NV 200 scheduled to be released next month, has been the subject of lawsuits, one from a group of fleet owners who argue that the city cannot mandate the use of a single model. Anyone who is tall would certainly wish to mandate this vehicle. As I experienced when I drove around with the city’s taxi commissioner, David S. Yassky, on Wednesday afternoon, the car has so much leg room that a person 6 feet 3 inches tall could sit comfortably on a trip from Midtown Manhattan to Jones Beach with two surfboards and a spaniel.        
The commission’s more significant legacy, though, is sure to be the introduction of its green cabs, approximately 200 of which have been visible in Upper Manhattan and in the other boroughs since last month. Painted the color of Granny Smith apples, the cabs are liveries that can be hailed. Previously this practice had been verboten. “I didn’t want to be giving the Arecibo guy a ticket for taking you home from BAM,” Mr. Yassky, referring to a Brooklyn car service, explained.        
The innovation of the green cabs, which have meters, was meant to help solve the problem of an unequal distribution of taxis in the city, with so many concentrated in Lower Manhattan and Midtown and so few available elsewhere. Its ancillary effect is a marginal disruption of the feudal system that brings enormous wealth to owners of yellow-taxi fleets, in possession of medallions that now cost more than $1 million apiece, as drivers themselves struggle to make any sort of reasonable living. The price of a permit for a green cab is $1,500 for three years, making it possible for drivers themselves to own them and ultimately profit from any appreciation.        
In July, Ebony Davila, who had been a livery driver in the Bronx for several years, received her permit for a green cab. She began driving it on Sept. 5 and within 10 days she had covered the cost of her permit and some additional fees, she told me. Increased passenger volume has meant that she has been making more money than she did in the past (she can still take flat-fee dispatch calls through a service), but her experience indicates how difficult the life of a driver in New York remains; the mother of a 9-year-old son, she clears about $840 a week after fees and leasing costs, putting in 10-hour days Mondays through Thursdays and working between 5 p.m. and 2 a.m. on the weekends.        
One morning last week, I accompanied Ms. Davila as she drove on East Fordham Road toward the Grand Concourse in the Bronx and through Washington Heights and other quadrants of Upper Manhattan. (On the West Side, green-cab drivers are limited to picking up passengers north of 110th Street, and on the East Side, to the area north of 96th Street.) Midmorning, activity was minimal. In the two hours I spent with Ms. Davila, she picked up one passenger, in Morningside Heights, who was going to East 72nd Street.        
Green cabs, in some sense, offer another lens into the vast differences between Manhattan and so much of the rest of the city. Doing business in the Bronx is particularly challenging, Ms. Davila told me, in part because so few customers have credit cards and because so many are accustomed to negotiating flat fees for livery service. This has left Ms. Davila to focus her efforts in Harlem, the area around Columbia University and Inwood, where she has done well.        
“In Manhattan, people love the meter,” Ms. Davila told me. “In the Bronx, they run from the meter.” A few days earlier, Ms. Davila had picked up a woman in Westchester Square in the Bronx who went to Burnside Avenue. The 12-minute ride cost $21.50 but the woman refused to pay more than $11 because that was the cost she had been used to. Other passengers have cried when they’ve heard their fares, Ms. Davila said.        
At one point when I was with her, a yellow-cab driver pulled up next to Ms. Davila and started to chat, expressing enthusiasm for the green-cab movement. Yellow-cab drivers talk to her all the time now, she said, often telling her that some day her medallion will be worth tens of thousand of dollars. She obviously hopes so. “I’m a single parent,” she said. “This is my future.”

DUBLIN — Ryanair, the budget airline based in Dublin, promised on Friday to transform its “abrupt culture” in a bid to win customers, acknowledging for the first time that a reputation for treating its passengers badly might have become a problem.        


The Irish airline said it would overhaul the way it communicates and be more lenient about fines for luggage sizes.        
“We should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily” irritate people, Michael O’Leary, Ryanair’s chief executive, said at the company’s annual meeting after several shareholders complained about the impact of customer service on sales.        
He said the airline would overhaul its Web site, set up a new team to respond to e-mail and stop fining customers whose carry-on baggage exceeded maximum sizes by a few millimeters.        
“A lot of those customer-services elements don’t cost a lot of money,” Mr. O’Leary said. “It’s something we are committed to addressing over the coming year.”        
While Ryanair’s focus on cost-cutting has helped it to grow — it flew more scheduled international passengers last year than any other airline — shareholders said the company’s reputation for poor customer service was limiting its room for growth.        
“I have seen people crying at boarding gates,” said Owen O’Reilly, a shareholder. “There is simply something wrong there that needs to be addressed.”        
Mr. O’Leary, who for years has played down such complaints, citing statistics about revenue growth and on-time departures, nodded as other shareholders told anecdotes about being verbally attacked at dinner parties.        
“I am very happy to take the blame or responsibility if we have a macho or abrupt culture,” he said. “Some of that may well be my own personal character deformities.”        
Mr. O’Leary said he was personally irritated that some Ryanair employees fined customers when their carry-on baggage was slightly above the maximum size. He said management would be more lenient.“If it’s a millimeter over size, get on with it,” he said. “We are not trying to penalize people for the sake of a millimeter.”

LONDON — P.G. Wodehouse, writing in his light-hearted mood, would have enjoyed telling the story of Sir Albert Richardson, whose possessions were sold this week at Christie’s. The collector’s pursuit of 18th- and 19th-century decorative art that once graced the aristocratic residences of Britain is recounted in a preface to Christie’s catalog by his grandson Simon Houfe.        


Richardson, who died in 1964, had belonged to a generation of stiff upper-lipped Britons uninclined to compromise. “Life at Avenue House was spartan, he would not allow electricity or modern conveniences in the house and only with great reluctance tolerated the telephone,” Mr. Houfe muses.        
Richardson was an extremist in traditionalism. To quote Mr. Houfe: “The family shivered in the winter and sweltered in the summer, making it extremely difficult to keep staff.” Bedfordshire, the county where Avenue House is located, in the small town of Ampthill, gets chilly in the winter.        
The architectural practice that Richardson ran at the back of his house presumably accounts for his love of well-structured furniture. Columns are a recurring feature in the pieces that the collector sought out, whether in a pair of demi-lune consoles made around 1800 that brought £9,375, or about $15,000, or in the pediment of an octagonal table designed by the famous George Bullock, which rose to £73,875.        
But what truly roused Richardson was reading the history of the past by tracing its objects to those who made them or commissioned them.        
A pair of George III “perfume burners” in the shape of white marble urns with ormolu (gilt bronze) fittings must have overjoyed the collector. The perfume burners are so close to a sketch in Matthew Boulton’s “Pattern Book” that they can be safely recognized as the work of “the pre-eminent English manufacturer of objets de luxe in the 18th century,” in the words of Adrian Hume-Sayer, one of the authors of the catalog.        
Orlando Rock, the international head of decorative art at Christie’s, pointed out in an interview by telephone that when Richardson acquired the perfume burners in 1933 little attention was given to Boulton’s work. Its true significance only came to light when Sir Nicholas Goodison published his book “Matthew Boulton” in 2002. Speaking before the sale, Mr. Rock placed the perfume burners among the top lots.        
Yet on Tuesday, the pair fetched £91,875, not even half of what another pair of Boulton’s perfume burners cost last December. True, this pair, which made £157,250 at Christie’s London, came from the collection of “The Princess Mary, the sister of George VI, Princess Royal, Countess of Harewood.”        
The French Louis XVI style that inspired Boulton has been gradually falling out of favor in the last two decades, and the price difference largely reflects the premium paid nowadays for a glitzy provenance.        
In a striking contrast, a George III dining room pedestal, cautiously “attributed to Thomas Chippendale,” more than tripled the high estimate when it went up to £112,275. The design is in the same Neoclassical vein as the Louis XVI style perfume burners credited to Boulton. But the pedestal has a lot more going for it.        
The figural motifs are the work of a supremely accomplished, albeit anonymous sculptor. Better, the laughing ram’s heads projecting from the corners and the frowning masks carved halfway up the sides have an expressiveness that give the piece of furniture a Surrealist twist attuned to current tastes. What’s more, the inside metallic fittings, which have been preserved instead of making room for shelves to transform the pedestal into a pier cabinet, make it a museum piece.        
Sadly, few among the items amassed by Richardson benefited from such advantages, and the sale had its ups and downs.        
A set of six Georgian armchairs from the 1780s closely following French Louis XVI models cost £20,000, missing the low estimate by a wide margin.

W Is for Woo-Woo: “Meet a new private eye — Kinsey Millhone.” That’s how the Book Review’s former crime columnist, Newgate Callendar, greeted readers on May 23, 1982, introducing Sue Grafton’s resourceful, virtuous, unlucky-in-love sleuth, who made her debut that spring in “A Is for Alibi” and has since gone on to star in 22 more alphabet novels. (The latest, “W Is for Wasted,” enters this week’s hardcover fiction list at No. 1, providing an emphatic answer to Callendar’s question, “Will the series take hold?”)        


Grafton, who is 73, didn’t start out as a crime writer. She published two mainstream literary novels in the 1960s and spent more than a decade working in Hollywood before a bitter divorce finally led her to mysteries: “I used to lie in bed at night just thinking of ways to do him in,” she has said of her ex-husband, “but I knew I was going to get caught. . . . So I thought, why don’t I put this plot between the covers of a book and get paid for it?” Now, with the series drawing to a close, readers tend to ask Grafton two questions: What will happen to Kinsey, and what in the world will she come up with for “X”? “Almost has to be Xenophobe or Xenophobia,” she told a Minneapolis reporter earlier this month. “I’ve checked the penal codes in most states and xylophone isn’t a crime, so I’m stuck.” As for Kinsey’s fate, “she’ll live,” Grafton told The Times Union of Albany, although “I don’t think you’ll see her turn 40. . . . We’re not gonna watch her go through menopause. You know, why is that good fiction?” As you can probably tell, Grafton gives good interviews — a Jungian with a sense of humor, she comes off as at once daffy and humble. “My rule is, I don’t tell the book. The book tells me,” she told The Times Union, explaining how she invents her stories. “I have to sit here, and I have to be an open channel. Pardon the woo-woo talk.”        
Grouchy Old Man: Billy Crystal’s wry look at aging, “Still Foolin’ ’Em” (it’s subtitled “Where I’ve Been, Where I’m Going, and Where the Hell Are My Keys?”), is the highest-ranking newcomer to the hardcover nonfiction list, where it slides in at No. 2. Crystal recently told The New York Times that as he gets older he’s bracing himself for roles like Mickey Rooney’s cantankerous horse trainer from “The Black Stallion” — but in the book, the Rooney he sometimes seems to be channeling instead is Andy, especially in a chapter in which he proclaims, “I don’t want to be the grouchy old man” but goes on to rail against “the little everyday things that annoy me.” These include fat people (“They crowd me on airplanes”), Internet trolls (“If your parents knew you did that, they would ask you to move out of their basement”) and athletes who use steroids (“You would think that with a size 15 head, there would be a brain in there”). This kind of humor generally leaves me cold — speaking of everyday annoyances — but Crystal is still capable of landing a punch, as when he complains about Congress: “If you want to get paid for doing nothing and blocking progress, become a movie studio executive.”

Marilyn Stasio has now been on the case for 25 years. In the Sept. 18, 1988, issue of the Book Review, Stasio took over the Crime column from her predecessor, Newgate Callendar (the pen name for Harold C. Schonberg, who covered classical music for The Times). She’s been grading detective work ever since.        


In a recent phone interview, she described her early nerves. “My preference at the time was for well-mannered, very smart detectives,” Stasio said. “I was afraid I was this big fraud, that I only liked one kind of writing and I would be found out. The first time I had to review a hard-boiled mystery, I would be dead. But instead I found that I really liked it. I love serial killers and mad dogs and all that stuff.” The biggest changes in the genre over the past quarter-century, according to Stasio, occurred when American women like Sara Paretsky, Sue Grafton and others entered the field and the convention of Heroic Man rescuing Helpless Maiden had to be overhauled. New victims had to be found. “Children were great; they were ideal,” Stasio said. “They were being kidnapped all over the place, left and right. One year, in three separate books, entire busloads of children were kidnapped.”        
Before coming to The Times, Stasio wrote Mystery Alley, a syndicated review column. During that period, she said, “editors were very glad to get the genre off their hands. I would read it all for them. They knew nothing, and didn’t care.” That, too, has changed. “It went from being a despised genre read by vulgarians like me to a very respected branch of literature.”        
Quotable 
“The respectability that came with the phrase ‘graphic novel’ is a thoroughgoing annoyance to me, because it leads to books that are made to be studied in academia, and that’s no less of a marketplace than making comics to appeal to 12-year-old boys whose prepubescent stirrings are beginning and they have to be titillated with action and sexualized images.” — Art Spiegelman, in NEA Arts Magazine        
Radical Fiction 
This week Pankaj Mishra and Jennifer Szalai appear for the first time in our new back-page feature, Bookends, where they take on the question: “How well does contemporary fiction address radical politics?” 
Mishra is the author of several books, including “The Romantics,” a novel, and “From the Ruins of Empire.” He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and contributes essays on politics and literature to The New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, The Guardian of London and The London Review of Books. Szalai was until 2010 a senior editor at Harper’s Magazine, where she oversaw the “Reviews” section. She has written for The New York Times Book Review, The Nation and The London Review of Books, among others.

WASHINGTON — House Republicans muscled through a stopgap bill Friday that would fund the government only if all spending for President Obama’s health care law is eliminated. Senate Democrats and President Obama quickly made it clear they had no intention of going along, putting the government on a course toward a shutdown unless one side relents.        


The 230-to-189 party-line vote in a bitterly divided House set in motion a fiscal confrontation with significant implications — politically and economically — but with an uncertain ending. Without a resolution, large parts of the government could shut down Oct. 1, and a first-ever default on federal debt could follow weeks later.        
Each side predicted that the other would be held responsible, but determined House Republicans knew they were taking a risk even as leaders of the party’s establishment warned about the threat of destructive political consequences.        
Mr. Obama called House Speaker John A. Boehner on Friday evening but only to reiterate that he would not negotiate with him on raising the federal debt limit and said it was Congress’s constitutional obligation to pay the nation’s bills. Both sides described the call as brief and fruitless.        
Senate Democratic leaders prepared to answer the House’s move with a vote in the coming days — possibly on the eve of government funding expiring — to strip the health care provision from the spending bill and send it back to the House with little time for Republicans to change it. Mr. Boehner would then face a decision on how to respond.        
After the House vote, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, called out by name Democratic senators running for re-election in Republican states, daring them to stand by the health care law.        
“We’re in this fight and we want the Senate to join us,” Mr. Cantor said at a Republican rally celebrating passage of the spending bill.        
Visiting Missouri, Mr. Obama struck back at Republicans a few hours after the vote.        
“They’re focused on politics,” Mr. Obama told autoworkers at a Ford plant in Liberty. “They’re focused on trying to mess with me; they’re not focused on you.”        
In a searing criticism of those threatening to refuse to raise the debt ceiling next month, causing the United States to default on its debts, Mr. Obama called the potential action “profoundly destructive.” If it happens, he said, “America becomes a deadbeat.”        
The events left Washington staring at the first government shutdown since 1996. Lawmakers brushed up on the lessons of the five days of November 1995, when 800,000 federal workers were sent home, and the 21-day partial shutdown from that December to January, when half the government closed.        
Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the White House budget director, told executive branch officials to begin preparing by updating their contingency plans and determining what would go offline.        
The relevant laws have provisions to ensure a shutdown is “orderly,” and to protect “the safety of human life or the protection of property,” she wrote to agencies. But otherwise, much of the government that is paid for through the Congressional appropriations process would close shop. Soldiers would report for duty, but would not be paid. National parks and monuments would shut down, with any tourists told to vacate within 48 hours. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers would go on unpaid furloughs.        
That said, many government functions would continue because of how they are paid for or because they are deemed vital. Air traffic controllers, border security officials and other public safety officers would remain at work. Social Security checks would continue to go out. Medicare would keep paying doctors and hospitals, though its claims processing systems might be disrupted. The self-financed Postal Service would remain operating as well.          
Officials from both parties involved in past shutdowns warned that House Republicans stand to come out on the losing end.

The events left Washington staring at the first government shutdown since 1996. Lawmakers brushed up on the lessons of the five days of November 1995, when 800,000 federal workers were sent home, and the 21-day partial shutdown from that December to January, when half the government closed.        
Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the White House budget director, told executive branch officials to begin preparing by updating their contingency plans and determining what would go offline.        
The relevant laws have provisions to ensure a shutdown is “orderly,” and to protect “the safety of human life or the protection of property,” she wrote to agencies. But otherwise, much of the government that is paid for through the Congressional appropriations process would close shop. Soldiers would report for duty, but would not be paid. National parks and monuments would shut down, with any tourists told to vacate within 48 hours. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers would go on unpaid furloughs.        
That said, many government functions would continue because of how they are paid for or because they are deemed vital. Air traffic controllers, border security officials and other public safety officers would remain at work. Social Security checks would continue to go out. Medicare would keep paying doctors and hospitals, though its claims processing systems might be disrupted. The self-financed Postal Service would remain operating as well.          
Officials from both parties involved in past shutdowns warned that House Republicans stand to come out on the losing end.

Editors' Note Appended 

Nine days before Easter in 2012, the Rev. Teresa MacBain sent a letter to the congregants she had pastored for three years at a Methodist church in Tallahassee, Fla. For much of that time, she had preached the Gospel every Sunday, only to slip each Monday into tormented doubt.        


Finally, she realized her faith crisis was over. She no longer believed in God. The daughter of a minister, the product of a divinity school, the enthusiastic evangelist doing the Lord’s will, she told her followers that she was resigning her pulpit.        
Her first public comments, a few days before she stepped down as minister, sounded brash, as she told a convention of atheists that she would gladly burn in hell with them. Deeper inside, however, she felt more sorrow than triumph, more exile than liberation.        
“After I stepped away from my ministry, I literally stepped off the cliff,” Ms. MacBain, 45, recalled in a recent interview. “I didn’t know what life would be like without a church. I was depressed. I was out there in limbo all at once. There is no community. There is no social network. The majority of friendships are gone. There is no place I can go every week where I know people and they know me.”        
Now, 18 months into a new life, Ms. MacBain is bringing much of her old one to the task of building congregations of nonbelievers. She has been hired as the director of the Humanist Community Project at Harvard  with the mandate to travel the country helping atomized groups of atheists, agnostics, humanists and freethinkers replicate the communal structure and support that organized religion provides to its faithful.        
This line of work draws directly on Ms. MacBain’s experience of seeing her father create and build congregations throughout the small-town South and of her own track record of ministering in churches, prisons, nursing homes and drug-rehab centers. Were she not helping to develop communities of nonbelievers, she would be called, in Christian parlance, a church-planter.        
In her insistence on recognizing the social value of religion, rather than merely disparaging it as superstition for saps, Ms. MacBain operates very much in sync with her boss, Greg M. Epstein, the humanist chaplain at Harvard. In his 2009 book, “Good Without God,” and in a subsequent 50-city speaking tour, Mr. Epstein espoused the creation of secular communities. By hiring Ms. MacBain, he has put nonbelieving boots on the ground.        
“The purpose of these communities,” Mr. Epstein wrote in an e-mail, “is to help us connect with one another more deeply, to spur us to act in the interest of the common good, and to change the way we think about values and purpose in a world where traditional religion is no longer vital for us. We’re not trying to build antireligious groups — the intention is more to answer questions about alienation, isolation, economic justice, and political and environmental sustainability, fighting back against religious privilege only when necessary.”        
Everything in her life prepared Ms. MacBain for such a role. She grew up a “PK” — a preacher’s kid — and savored the role. She tagged along with her father on hospital visits. She went with him to classes at Bible college. She sang in the youth choir and taught Sunday school.        
She also strained to accept the theology of her father’s Baptist faith, which reserved the ministry for men.        
“For me, the lesson was that doubting is sinful and wrong,” she said. “If you have these things come up, you suppress them, you ignore them, you pray them away. This natural inquisitiveness and questioning is just wrong. And if I did them, I was displeasing God. For me, life was about being the person who loved God and wanted to be everything God wanted me to be. That just carried me on through decades.”        
Growing into adulthood, however, Ms. MacBain ran aground on what seemed like irreconcilable messages in Scripture. In First Corinthians alone, for example, Verse 14:34 instructed women to be silent in church, while Verse 11:5 referred to women praying and prophesying. If text is divinely inerrant, as Ms. MacBain had been taught, how could both statements be true?        
She tried to solve her dilemma — and answer God’s call — by becoming a pastor in the more theologically liberal Methodist church in the early 2000s.        
Yet despite her sense of purpose in aiding the needy, despite her professional pride in a well-prepared sermon, her doubts never subsided. They ultimately led her to write that letter just before Easter 2012.        
An atheist would never believe in providence, so let’s just say that by very welcome coincidence Ms. MacBain found herself speaking at the American Humanist Association convention one month later, with Mr. Epstein in the audience. After she finished her address — using the characters in “The Wizard of Oz” as examples of how to build community — he approached her.        
“I can’t believe you just said those things,” she recalls his having told her. “I’ve been working on them for 10 years.”        
Then he described the Humanist Community at Harvard, which was previously unknown to her. He was in the process of raising its annual budget to $500,000 from $28,000. And his immediate goal was to hire a point person to assist nascent congregations of nonbelievers.        
Seven weeks ago, moving from Tallahassee to Cambridge, Ms. MacBain became that person.        
“Without knowing it at first,” she said of herself and Mr. Epstein, “we were on the same page, seeing the desire of people — atheists, humanists, nonbelievers — who want to connect into a community and don’t know how. Within the free-thought world, the secular world, it’s desired, but the resources to build it haven’t been there.”

Editors' Note: September 27, 2013The On Religion column on Saturday examined the crisis of faith of a minister, Teresa MacBain, who resigned her pulpit after concluding that she no longer believed in God. After the article was published, questions were raised about her educational background. Although her résumé says she earned a masters of divinity degree from Duke University, she now acknowledges that she received no degree from Duke.
The column also misstated the timing of her first public comments about her atheism. Ms. MacBain spoke to a convention of atheists a few days before — not after — she stepped down as minister of a Methodist church in Tallahassee, Fla.

Metro,"










In the restaurants, where he managed to thread his way through the well-fueled crowds at the bar, no one wondered why he did not order a drink. In the hotel, where he acted the same as any other guest, no one wondered why he never went upstairs to his room.        


No one realized, as he pivoted around and rolled out, that he had taken more than a look at the crowds. But the police say that he snatched handbags from women preoccupied with their $23 bigeye tuna tataki or their $34 rum punch — or with checking in for the night.        
He was an unconventional bandit, the man in the wheelchair.        
The police said on Friday that he had struck three times in the last month — at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square; at Nobu 57, an expensive Japanese restaurant on West 57th Street; and at Havana Central on West 46th Street, a Cuban-themed restaurant where posters behind the bar promise “the best rum punch in New York.” The three victims were not identified.        
After one of his capers, a police spokesman said, the thief paid for a cab ride to New Jersey with a credit card from the purse he had just stolen. He also used a stolen credit card to buy pizza.        
The police, after releasing photographs of the suspect on Thursday, said on Friday that they had not taken anyone into custody. He was wearing dark, long-sleeved shirts in all of the photos, which were taken by video cameras in the restaurants and in the hotel. In one image, he appeared to be wearing glasses.        
The police said it was not clear whether he was actually disabled or whether the wheelchair was, in effect, merely a disguise.        
Either way, it apparently let him reach for a purse that had been carefully stowed under the bar at Nobu 57. And on Friday, customers there and hotel guests at the Marriott Marquis were intrigued by what they considered his creative — and brazen — modus operandi.        
“How could he do that?” asked Miriam Ngom, an advertising manager from Paris who was looking at e-mails as she sat on a bench in the lobby of the Marriott Marquis, with its glass-walled elevators and atriumlike layout. “You never know who you can trust.” She had stashed her own tan Gucci purse out of sight, beneath the sleevelike purple carrying case for her laptop computer.        
The first theft was on the eighth floor of the hotel, where guests check in after an elevator ride from the street. The police said that at 8:45 p.m. on Aug. 19, the man stole a bag from a 42-year-old tourist from Virginia. The woman’s bag was missing soon after she checked in, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Brendan Ryan.        
The woman “had set the items down on the floor,” said Kathleen Duffy, a hotel spokeswoman.        
“She did not see this happening, I’m assuming,” Ms. Duffy said. “According to the video cameras, there was a person in a wheelchair seen approaching where she was standing, and then he left. We have an image of him coming near the person in question and we have an image of him leaving the hotel.”        
Sergeant Ryan said the bandit rode off with the woman’s wallet and about $300 in cash, along with her iPad, a necklace and a pair of sunglasses.        
He grabbed a bag that was lying on an empty chair at Havana Central around 9:45 p.m. on Sept. 3. The bag belonged to a 40-year-old woman from Illinois who was dancing.        
The theft at Nobu, shortly before midnight on Aug. 30, yielded credit cards, keys and cosmetics, said Sergeant Ryan, adding that the 34-year-old victim had not realized that her bag was missing until she reached for it later on.        
The man had rolled in close to ask a question at the long onyx-and-walnut bar, said the restaurateur Drew Nieporent, who operates Nobu.        
“I guess that’s when he made the move,” he said. “The woman didn’t have the purse on the back of the chair — that’s problematic, we warn people about that — but in front, down under the bar.”        
Mr. Nieporent said the man did not order anything. “I think it was quick,” he said. “He sizes up the place, sees what he needs and gets out of there.”        
Still, when a reporter struck up a conversation on Friday about the thefts, one woman at the bar lifted her purse off the empty bar stool next to her and placed it in her lap. Another woman marveled at how the suspect must have maneuvered on his way in and out.        
“If somebody comes near me in a wheelchair, the first thing I do is grab my purse so it wouldn’t get run over,” said a woman at the bar at Nobu 57 on Friday afternoon between calls and text messages on her two cellphones. “But late at night, everyone’s drunk. They won’t notice. It’s not like at noon, when everyone’s sober.”

STRATFORD-UPON-AVON, ENGLAND — Visitors to Shakespeare County Raceway during the annual Yanks Weekend could be forgiven for thinking they had stumbled into a regular Sunday meet at a typical American dragstrip — were it not for the British accents and license plates, that is, and the track name’s incongruous association with the playwright, born a few miles down the road.        


Among the racecars present last spring were some hallmarks of Americana, including a ’71 Chevrolet Camaro called the Bootlegger and a ’57 Bel Air with “Honky Tonkin’ ” lettered on its doors. A Show ’n’ Shine event featured dozens more Detroit products, restored to original condition and parked amid tents and campers on the grassy grounds of a former Royal Air Force base in Warwickshire.        
Even in this setting, which emphatically favored speed over style, Norman Dawood’s 1949 Cadillac Series 62 Club Coupe drew a crowd of admirers.        
“I have other classic cars,” said Mr. Dawood, who owns such quintessentially British automobiles as a 1966 Aston Martin DB6 and a 1963 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III. “But no other car gets anything like the looks that this one gets.”        
When Mr. Dawood, a Londoner who runs a translating and subtitling business, saw the black fastback on eBay, listed by a seller in New Jersey, he bought it without hesitation. With characteristic understatement, Mr. Dawood admitted that the car was “a bit of an impulse purchase.”        
Like many fans of the big American cars that British enthusiasts call Yank Tanks, Mr. Dawood was particularly drawn to Cadillacs from 1949, which was the second model year to feature the auto industry’s pioneering foray into tailfins. Discreet compared with the towering appendages that arrived a decade later, the fins had been inspired by a clandestine look at the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, a fighter plane with twin tails, given to General Motors’ designers working on the ’48 models.        
It was the ’49s, however, that were first to be fitted with a new 331-cubic-inch overhead-valve V-8, which became a standard-bearer for G.M. The engine’s considerable power can still be felt on the highway, where Mr. Dawood’s car easily keeps up with the flow of modern traffic.        
Mr. Dawood’s Club Coupe, also known as a Sedanette, lacks power steering but has several options, including a Hydra-Matic transmission — which added $174 to the 1949 sticker price of $2,966 — as well as power windows and seats. Befitting a Cadillac, it is fitted with the modern conveniences of its day, including a cigar lighter, multiple ashtrays and enough headroom for a driver to wear his fedora.        
It is impractical to keep a behemoth ’49 Cadillac in London, where compact cars ply narrow roads, so Mr. Dawood stores it here, about 100 miles to the northwest. That it was a sunny day, so uncharacteristic of a British spring, when he drove it to the Yanks Weekend, was fortunate, as the driver’s window was stuck open, its power lift mechanism having given out.        
The window malfunction is emblematic of a series of small problems, some potentially incapacitating, that plague Mr. Dawood’s Cadillac, and indeed many of the American classics increasingly bought on the Internet by British collectors.        
“The American car scene in the U.K. is just growing and growing because of the Internet,” said John Pryor, president of the National Association of Street Clubs, a co-sponsor of Yanks Weekend.        
“More people are buying classic American cars now because they can fix them more easily, and we’re now seeing dedicated shops opening up here,” said Mr. Pryor, who recently traded in his 1959 Vauxhall Victor for a ’56 Chevy.        
While the Cadillac was en route from the United States, Mr. Dawood found a copy of a British magazine, Classic American.        
“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” he said. “On the cover was a car identical to the one I’d just bought, belonging to some Scottish earl. The article was about a guy who specialized in restoring American cars, and I thought, ‘This is brilliant. How lucky I am to find someone who already knows all about this exact one?’ ”

Cherry Jones is one of the greatest stage actresses of her generation. Though she is probably best known for her Emmy-winning portrayal of President Allison Taylor on “24,” watching her on television is nothing like watching her in the theater, her sweep unconstrained by a camera.        


Jones won her first Tony Award for her role in the 1995 revival of “The Heiress,” based on the Henry James novel “Washington Square.” Her transformation from the diminished daughter of a cruel father to an expert in cruelty herself was a master class in voice and movement. Her second Tony came a decade later for John Patrick Shanley’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “Doubt.” Her Sister Aloysius, the nun who suspects a priest of sexually molesting a boy, was as terrifying as you’d expect; it was her humanity that surprised.        
Now Jones is back on Broadway as Amanda Wingfield, a frantic single mother whose husband abandoned the family years earlier, in Tennessee Williams’s “Glass Menagerie.” Zachary Quinto plays her alienated son, Tom; Celia Keenan-Bolger is Laura, his disabled, pathologically shy sister; and Brian J. Smith is Jim, Laura’s gentleman caller. Both Jones and the production, directed by John Tiffany, received raves earlier this year at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. It will open at the Booth Theater on Sept. 26.        
Last month, I talked with Jones, a Tennessee native, in her Greenwich Village apartment before the company reassembled for rehearsals. It was a Sunday afternoon, and she wore jeans and no makeup. For serious actresses, there is no greater challenge than mastering Amanda’s complexities: her desperation over her daughter’s future, her frustration with her son’s disaffection, her obsessive reveries of the past. It seemed the perfect place to begin.        
Alex Witchel: Was Amanda Wingfield a character familiar to you?        
Cherry Jones: She was nothing like the Southern ladies I grew up with. I found her almost freakish compared to the Southern women I knew.        
A.W.: How so?        
C.J.: I grew up with a creative, practical, English-teaching mother, and I found Amanda to be kind of abhorrent, to tell you the truth. And the play was so depressing. This is where it gets embarrassing, because clearly I lacked the depth and experience to appreciate the play for the masterpiece it is, and the woman for who she is, because now I have nothing but respect for Amanda Wingfield. John Tiffany talked me into doing a reading of it, and afterward, I just — as we say in Paris, Tenn. — squealed like a pig under a gate. I realized what an extraordinary gift it would be to get to play her.        
A.W.: You’d seen the play before.        
C.J.: I’ve seen “Glass” more times than I think I’ve seen any play, and of course the reason is not because I wanted to but because all my friends, or actresses I greatly admired, were playing Amanda. My not wanting to play her had more to do with the fact that I just didn’t think I was capable of it. I don’t think in Cambridge I came close. I gained over the course of the last three years, since my parents died, a good deal of weight. So when I found myself about to begin “Glass Menagerie,” I once again attempted to quit smoking, and I gained even more weight. I feel because of the extra weight I made her almost too aunty-like. Oh, I shouldn’t be saying any of this.        
A.W.: Why not?        
C.J.: Well, because this is for me to work on the next few weeks and months and not to be talking about. I guess I’m trying to say it will be interesting now that I’ve shed a few stone to see how that affects my playing of Amanda. I think it will, and I shan’t say another word on that subject.        
A.W.: I read that as a leading lady, you also lead the company and that you do it well. You have been known to blast the soundtrack of “Patton” to get everyone motivated before a show.        
C.J.: I used to do that to get me going occasionally. I always think of myself as being part of the ensemble. But because I’m now usually the oldest and usually have the leading role, I guess that adds up to being the leading lady of the ensemble. This thing about age is so heavenly with these kids, because Celia, Zach, Brian and I are extremely close. We fell on one another like puppies in a box from the moment the four of us got together. As we know, “The Glass Menagerie” is one of the most intimate quartets in dramatic literature. They make me feel like a dear friend, but occasionally they’ll write to me and say, “Dear Mama,” and it’s been a treasure for me, as a childless lesbian, at this point in my career, to have this relationship with them.        
A.W.: Tell me your rituals, once performances start.

“Reply me its very imported,” the subject line demanded, bossy and impatient. Before I even opened the message, blinking over my morning coffee, I knew where this was going.        


For a couple of years now, I have received e-mails from complete strangers soliciting my opinion on deeply private matters. The content of these queries varies widely, but there are always telltale signs: they are almost always written by nonnative English speakers; they all claim, as this one attempted, to be important; and they always describe a conundrum, soliciting my direction on what to do.        
The first time I received such an e-mail, I assumed it was a mistake and ignored it. I ignored the next few e-mails as well, but I began to wonder if someone was playing a prank on me. The e-mails kept coming, sporadically, and without any hint of a setup or any sign of a punch line. Eventually I discovered the explanation.        
My surname, Mufti, is an Arabic word meaning “one who gives a fatwa.” In Islam, the prescribed path to salvation, the Shariah, is really known only to God. Muftis are scholars tasked with deciphering God’s will on a given matter, from the ancient and profound to the modern and rather mundane — which insurance plan to choose, what financial investments to make. About 500 years ago, I am told, some of my ancestors were employed as muftis in the courts of a Muslim emperor in South Asia. Though I was born in the American Midwest, and mostly attended American schools, my name remains a vestigial marker of my ancestors’ profession.        
I Googled “mufti” one day and scrolled through the results: a Wikipedia entry, a few dictionary definitions and a Web site with a parade of men in tight pants and flashy sunglasses from a kitschy Indian designer. The link to my personal Web site sits at the top of the second page of results. I am the first flesh-and-blood mufti — if only in name — you encounter if you are desperate enough to be looking for one on the Internet.        
This e-mail with the pushy subject line was unlike any other I had received. “My friend, who lives in Sweden, wants to get married to a Swedish woman,” it began in Latinized Urdu. “But this marriage will be a fake marriage.” Tahir, the sender, explained that his friend was already married to a woman in Pakistan but wanted to marry a Swedish woman to obtain Swedish citizenship. Tahir’s friend wanted him to deliver fake Pakistani divorce papers by forging both his and his wife’s signatures. Oblivious to the forgery, the Swedes would allow Tahir’s friend to marry, putting the secret bigamist on a path to Swedish citizenship and all that it offered. I doubted that either of the women were privy to the elaborate scheme.        
It was Tahir’s heedlessly narrow question at the end that surprised me the most: “If I forge the signatures on the divorce papers, will that really mean my friend will be divorced from his wife?” It was this small, rather arcane detail about God’s view of the marital bond that nagged his conscience — not the various international and domestic laws and criminal codes that he would break. “Would you do me a favor and resolve this problem?”        
The fates of several men and women scattered across the world were thrust into my hands. The only thing I knew for certain was that this would not be a victimless crime. So for the first time ever, I began typing out a response to such an e-mail — my first fatwa. I listed the laws that Tahir would break and the people he would hurt if he went through with his friend’s scheme. “Don’t do it,” I wrote. But then I deleted it all. This wasn’t a fatwa. Tahir’s question was specific, as it should be in a fatwa request. Straying from this would just expose me as an impostor, a novice mufti — a hack.        
So I tried again. “Yes,” I wrote out in Latinized Urdu. “If you sign all these papers and send them to your friend in Sweden, this will actually lead to a divorce in the eyes of Allah. Allah does not differentiate between real and forged divorce papers.”        
I felt my heart pound, terrified at the ease of my lies and their power to steer the course of others’ lives. As my finger hovered over the send button, I felt something tighten around me, and like Tahir, I was paralyzed by the decision in front of me. I saved the message in my drafts folder, where it sits today. I wished there were someone out there, anybody, who could tell me what I should do. For the first time ever, I felt the need for a fatwa.

Is it ethical to buy something at a yard sale or a flea market at the seller’s asking price if you know the value of the item to be significantly higher than what is being asked? Let’s say, for example, someone is selling an old comic book worth thousands of dollars but asks for only a quarter because he or she does not know the true value. Is it incumbent on the seller to do his or her research? If the seller does not, is it fair game? RYAN ATLAS, BOSTON        


The operative word in your question is “true” directly placed before the word “value.” You suggest the “true value” of a specific comic book is a few thousand dollars — but all that means is someone might be willing to pay that much for it, based on extrinsic qualities (rarity, for example). To the person running the flea market, the “true value” of the comic book is virtually nothing. There is no “true value” for any object: it’s always a construct, provisionally defined by a capricious market and the locality of the transaction. Things cost what they are being sold for, and they’re worth whatever the seller can get. It’s unethical for a seller to knowingly take advantage of someone’s practical desperation in a crisis (say, selling D batteries for $75 a pack during a citywide blackout), but it’s not unethical for a buyer to accept whatever arbitrary value a seller places on his or her goods.        
Look at it like this: Let’s say the person at the flea market was selling that same rare comic for $2,000. You, however, would be willing to pay far more than that; because of its sentimental value and the status it will bring among your comic-book-collecting peers, you’d gladly fork over $5,000. Would you feel the need to inform the seller, “You know, I’d actually pay you $3,000 more than what you’re asking”? I don’t think you would, and no one would expect you to.        
Now, this does not mean it’s ethical to take advantage of people simply because they’re uninformed about the arcane details of modern commerce. If you’re visiting an elderly neighbor and notice he’s using a 1909 Honus Wagner baseball card as a bookmark for his Bible, you can’t casually offer to buy the card for $1 in the hope that he won’t know any better. You can’t proactively look for ways to swindle people. But things change when somebody decides to put a nonessential item on the market: the person looks at an object, creates an imaginary value for what it is worth and asks for the equivalent of that fabricated value in currency. If the number is too high, no one will buy it; if the number is too low, the seller leaves money on the table. But people don’t inherently deserve the maximum potential price for whatever they’re trying to move. If that’s what they desire, they have to get it for themselves.

In 1904, the Cooper Underwear Company ran a magazine ad announcing a new product for bachelors. In the “before” photo, a man averts his eyes from the camera as if embarrassed; he has lost all the buttons on his undershirt and has safety-pinned its flaps together. In the “after” photo, a virile gentleman sports a handlebar mustache, smokes a cigar and wears a “bachelor undershirt” stretchy enough to be pulled over the head. “No safety pins — no buttons — no needle — no thread,” ran the slogan aimed at men with no wives and no sewing skills. Someone in the U.S. Navy must have seen the logic in this, because the following year, the quartermaster’s office specified that sailors should wear undershirts with no buttons under their uniforms; soon thousands of men became acquainted with the comfort of the cotton pullover.        


Though the Cooper Underwear Company popularized the crew-neck shirt, they did not invent the style. The shirts evolved out of the long johns that men wore in the 19th century, when a number of garment makers experimented with methods that would allow the fabric to stretch over the head and then snap back into shape.        
In the 1890s, the cotton pullover still looked like underwear to most people and wearing it in public was considered scandalous. Lawmakers in Havana went so far as to ban the public display of any underwearlike top, and so laborers had to toil in the heat wearing long-sleeve shirts with buttons.        
But gradually, the crew-neck caught on. In 1920, the garment was reborn under another name, thanks partly to F. Scott Fitzgerald. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the author was the first to use the word “T-shirt” in print; it appears in the novel “This Side of Paradise,” in a list of accouterments that a character carries with him to boarding school. Fitzgerald seems to have assumed that the idea of a “T-shirt” (so named, presumably, because of the shirt’s shape) would be familiar to readers and that they would associate it with the “white-flannelled, bareheaded youths” of New England prep schools.        
By the 1940s, T-shirts had become ubiquitous in high schools. A newspaper columnist named Nancy Pepper wrote that teenagers owned closets full of T-shirts and customized them with sew-on patches and fringe. She reported that some high-school boys even used their T-shirts to advertise that they were available for make-out sessions; around the necklines of their shirts, the boys inscribed the words, “Neck here.”

Jacques Van Gool is the owner of Backstage Auctions, an online auction house that specializes in rock memorabilia. 
Do you sell a lot of T-shirts? Yes, T-shirts have become legitimate collectors’ items. I’ll never forget when Jennifer Aniston put on an MC5 shirt.        
Did you suddenly see a jump in sales or auction prices when that happened? Absolutely. Keep in mind, it’s not unusual to see a 1970s shirt for as little as $25. But you also find them for $1,000. Some of the most desirable shirts to collect are shirts that were exclusively made by the promoter for the staff that was working a specific concert. Let’s say the Academy of Music in New York in 1974 had a show with Alice Cooper and the promoter printed up 30 shirts just for the staff. Obviously that shirt is valuable.        
What is the most you’ve ever got for a T-shirt? Around $1,500. That was an original Fillmore West shirt that was worn by a band member of Frank Zappa. And it came with unquestionable provenance because he’s wearing the shirt on one of Frank Zappa’s albums.        
I assume you collect a few of your own. I have a ZZ Top 1975 crew shirt that I love.        
Is it valuable to you because of the memories? That shirt specifically? No. I bought it as part of a collection. As for the shirts with memories for me, I have old Kiss T-shirts that I’m partial to, because Kiss was the band that got me into collecting back in the ’70s.        
Anything else we should know about T-shirt collecting? I am fascinated by how we have supersized our society. A large T-shirt in 1970 seems really small now. Everybody was skinny, and shirts were tight back then. The garment industry has changed the sizes almost every 10 years. The shirts are wider and longer now. When we do our auctions, we always make sure that we specify the dimensions. You measure a shirt from pit to pit and from the top of the collar to the bottom. And we have to let our customers know the true size, because they could buy a large and end up with something tiny.

Dip into the comments, the American text genre of the moment, and you can sense the currents that move American life. “The comments are where the real America is,” someone once wrote in a comment thread. Comments also may be the most obnoxious development of the Web, the wild back alleys where people sound their acid yawps. Their tenor is now so bad that last November a game designer, Shane Liesegang, set up a Twitter feed, @avoidcomments, where he tweets things like “I once showed a comments section to a man in Reno, just to watch him cry.” He now has 27,000 followers.        


When we complain about comments, I’ve noticed, we do so as if we’re dealing with some emanation of human nature or the lusty democratic energies of the American soul. But when I went digging into the history of the Web to find out where online comments really came from, it’s clear that they’re the consequences of what was technically feasible at a certain point and how that feasibility was subsequently implemented. We tend to think that comments represent the culture, but in fact the distinct culture of commenting grew out of digital constraints. Given what Web users had to work with, comments were bound to get weedy.        
Comments as we know them — lines of text stacked atop one another in chronological order — are direct descendants of bulletin-board systems, or B.B.S., which date to the 1970s; users could dial in with a modem and contribute to discussion forums. The computer code that determined the order in which text appears on a B.B.S. also provides the basic architecture of the comment thread. That code, or script, became the basis for an early commenting function called the “guest book”: a place for simple text entry in which any visitor could type a note. Guest books were attached to the Web site as a whole, not to any specific content on it. This created confusion about the sort of opportunity that the guest book presented. Was it the soapbox of the online world? Or was it a bathroom wall?        
Fray.com, a popular Web site started in 1996, which used freeware guest-book script, was among the first to harness the potential of the guest book. A question would be posed, and answers contributed by readers would be published in real time. The Web site was essentially a collection of guest books, each one with a prompt, and the replies were all stand-alone contributions, adrift in a sea of other people who were speaking to themselves.        
It’s difficult to give credit for the invention of comments as we now understand them to one specific person or site. An interactive book, “Travels With Samantha,” which allowed readers to submit comments via a form (much as modern comments are), won a Best of the Web award for document design in 1994, which was the same year that a consortium of World Wide Web developers created W3 Interactive Talk to discuss technical matters — on which discussion points were submitted by a form that made them part of a topic page.        
There are competing claims about the first blog to offer comments. One pioneer is Bruce Ableson, who created Open Diary in 1998, an Internet journaling project that allowed diarists to respond to one another’s entries. Around the same time, the software developer Dave Winer created a discussion board with a commenting feature. The first comment there arrived on Oct. 5, 1998: “Too bad coders can’t be like rock stars and get their money for nothing and their chicks for free.”        
As the Web evolved, the simple top-to-bottom arrangement of autonomous lines of text had a huge influence on the culture of commenting — and it now feels as natural as having sidewalks on two sides of the street. But the typical Web page presents a hierarchy. At the top is the article, post, video or image, while the comments dangle underneath like suckerfish from an indifferent shark.        
“Having the comments at the bottom of the page — people feel that; they feel they’re not as legitimate a voice as the original post,” says Travis Nichols, who moderated a Poetry Foundation blog for several years and drew on this experience to write a novel, “The More You Ignore Me,” whose belligerent narrator takes over a cooking Web site with a venomous lament. Commenters show up with an immediate grudge, Nichols observed — they know they’ve been relegated to the steerage class of the public discourse.        
As a result, commenters became territorial. “When we had to be more aggressive in deleting comments that violated our commenting policy,” says Bill Adee, The Chicago Tribune’s vice president of digital operations, “I got far more complaints about deleting comments than I did about the level of discourse.”

WHAT WAS, IS AND WILL BE POPULAR 

In the mid-’60s, I owned a Top 40 AM radio station in Cleveland (WIXY 1260 — it rhymes!). Our very livelihood depended on playing the “most popular” songs of the day. Early on, we decided that as data sets, lists of songs in Billboard were unreliable and listener requests were unwieldy. We concentrated instead on actual record sales and sustained our popularity with listeners for many years. It was a simpler time. As Adam Sternbergh points out, thanks to today’s ubiquitous media choices, rather than sharing our experiences, we are all relegated to “our own individual cocoon.” NORMAN WAIN, Lyndhurst, Ohio The Times can’t believe that a show about rural America and hunting (“Duck Dynasty”) can be more popular than one about sophisticated Manhattanites (“Mad Men”)? Your biases are amazing, to the point that you have to toss “Mad Men” a crumb: “Yet by a different definition — the extent to which, say, a show saturates the cultural conversation.” O.K. “Cultural conversation” that occurs in . . . Manhattan. I think that you folks need to get out more. MICHAEL JAMES COBB, Myakka City, Fla., posted on nytimes.com This is not a new phenomenon — not every artist, author or musician through the ages was wildly popular in their day. Van Gogh would have been highly tweeted — think of that ear — but he was not a financial success until after his death. DAVID SABLE, Global C.E.O., Y&R, posted on huffingtonpost.com THE GLOBAL ELITE’S FAVORITE STRONGMAN Jeffrey Gettleman describes Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, as “authoritarian” and “repressive.” But as someone who has studied collective trauma in Rwanda, I believe that Kagame’s policies are a psychologically valid response to the challenge of rebuilding the social fabric of Rwanda post-genocide. It is a basic principle of trauma psychology that for people to deal with past events, they must feel safe in the present. Kagame’s social policies have created a sense of security that will make it possible for Rwanda to move forward. CARL AUERBACH, Professor, Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology at Yeshiva University, New York For those of us who live in Rwanda, it is puzzling to see others call Kagame a dictator. How does an oppressive regime lift more than one million people out of poverty in less than five years? How does Kagame ensure universal health insurance and primary education, make the country one of the safest and cleanest in the world, create one of the most business-friendly environments on the continent and enable an average G.D.P. growth of 8 percent for the past five years? PAUL KAYOBOKE, Kigali, Rwanda, posted on nytimes.com In Rwanda, I asked my guide what he thought of the fact that there is no freedom of speech in the country, according to some journalists, and he said: “People assume because conversations don’t happen in English, they are not happening. Listen to radio in Kinyarwanda, and you know we are having tough discussions. Bazungu” — white people — “make a lot of assumptions.” LEXA D. NGIRA, Toronto, posted on nytimes.com Despite a few caveats, this was quite a paean to a sociopath commanding an army that invaded neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo in 1996, starting years of war and conflict in which millions of people died. Western leaders talk about stopping the next Rwanda in Syria, but what about stopping the Rwanda in Congo? It’s difficult for Kagame to credibly negotiate for territory within the boundaries of Congo. Hence his army’s cooperation with the rebel group M23, which, as Gettleman writes, “has murdered civilians and gang-raped women, wreaking destruction on a swath of the eastern part of that country.” ANN GARRISON, Oakland, posted on nytimes.com THE STEELY, HEADLESS KING OF TEXAS HOLD ’EM I can’t get over the feeling that the poker-playing machine deals cards and every once in a while peeks and cheats. As a programmer, I know how easy it would be to bury that code in its system. DOUG DINGLE, Los Angeles, posted on nytimes.com          
A man writes an angry e-mail to his wife, regrets it and deletes the e-mail when he happens to find her in-box open on their shared computer. The Ethicist, Chuck Klosterman, wrote that this was unethical.

54% — It’s O.K. to delete an angry e-mail if you have the means to.        
26% — It’s not O.K. since he violated her privacy.        
6% — It’s O.K., but he should tell her what he did.        
14% — He should ask her to delete it.

As a criminal-defense lawyer, you’ve represented a notorious roster of clients. You’ll take pretty much anyone except for mobsters.  I wouldn’t say I’d take any client. If I had a client I believed were guilty of pedophilia, for instance, it’s just not the right case for me. It doesn’t mean that person is not entitled to representation. That being said, I don’t take organized-crime cases. My parents were Italian immigrants, and my dad’s parents had run-ins with organized crime in Red Hook.        


Wasn’t your first legal job transcribing the Gotti trial?  Yes, I worked for lawyers involved in the Gotti trial, and I got hired to do the transcription of these tapes. That was my first foray into the criminal arena.        
Now you represent Alex Rodriguez in his dispute with Major League Baseball over his suspected use of performance-enhancing drugs. As a Yankees fan, what did you think of him before you represented him?  Just reading the papers, it was pretty easy to get a pretty unfavorable impression.        
What do you think of him now?  He’s very easy to talk to, very intelligent and also very — I don’t know if the right word is “humble,” but maybe “humble” is the right word. My first impression was: My god, this guy’s getting such a bum rap.        
But you’re obviously going to say Rodriguez is a good guy.  If I didn’t think so, I would skirt that question skillfully. I can tap dance pretty well.        
You were a Yankees fan growing up.  The first time my dad took me out to Yankee Stadium was the George Brett pine-tar-incident game.        
Is it possible to be a die-hard Yankees fan and call the Yankees’ G.M. Brian Cashman and the Yankees’ president Randy Levine thugs?  I didn’t characterize them as thugs. I said it was a thuglike culture. I’m not rooting for the front office. I’m rooting for the pinstripes.        
During a “Today” show interview, Matt Lauer produced a release letter from Major League Baseball that would’ve allowed you to make Rodriguez’s medical records public. On air, you refused to sign it.  A little surprising because it was the “Today” show. Had I agreed to go on Jerry Springer, I would have said, “O.K., fair.” Two high-ranking members of the “Today” show staff called me after to say they were very surprised and disappointed by that.        
Were they apologetic?  Very much so. It was a cheap P.R. stunt by Major League Baseball.        
I read an article in The New York Post that said you might be the most hated lawyer in New York City. The headline was “The Devils’ Advocate.”  When you reach a certain level of either success or notoriety, people take shots at you. It was actually a flattering article. It came out after I won the rape-cops case — it was about how I win cases that people say I can’t win.        
You have a T-shirt suggesting that David Ortiz used performance-enhancing drugs.  Instead of saying “Big Papi,” it says, “Big PEDi.”        
You grew up in Sheepshead Bay, and yet you went to Yeshiva of Flatbush for elementary school.  My mother and father quickly determined that the best education I was going to get as a young child was at Yeshiva, instead of getting beat up at P.S. 12. I still have my yarmulke.        
You played hockey at Skidmore College and had 355 penalty minutes in one year — not what you would expect from a Yeshiva guy.  I hold that record, but I was not just an enforcer. Our team was so small, so I took the role of a protector — sort of what I do now, right?        
Were most of those penalty minutes fight-related?I didn’t get a lot of two-minute tripping penalties.        
When was the last time you actually were in a real fight?  I’m going to decline to answer that.        
You’ve said that you’re still very much a street kid from Sheepshead Bay, but you live in Connecticut now and own a 49-foot yacht.It’s a boat, it’s not a yacht.

FANGIRLBy Rainbow Rowell St. Martin’s Griffin, $18.99. 


In her first semester at the University of Nebraska, nearly everything that once made Cath feel happy and safe comes undone. Her father’s manic episodes are getting worse. Her mother, who walked out on the family 10 years ago, suddenly wants to be friends. And her identical twin sister — the socially adept and stylish one — is living in another dorm and partying hard.        
But for thousands of online readers, Cath is more than an unhappy freshman, eating protein bars in her room to avoid the cafeteria. She’s “Magicath,” the prolific author of fan fiction that remixes the hugely popular Simon Snow novels. (They bear a tongue-in-cheek resemblance to the Harry Potter series.) But Cath’s ease plotting the lives of young wizards doesn’t translate to how she manages her own.        
Rowell, whose last young adult novel was “Eleanor & Park,” specializes in young misfits charting their way in the world. She doesn’t disappoint here. Though the theme of a young writer finding her voice may be familiar, Rowell brings to it fresh humor, heart and more than a few surprises. Cath’s relationships, tender and untidy, ring true. Excerpts from Simon Snow novels and Magicath’s fan fiction appear between chapters, offering echoes of Cath’s struggle.        
IF YOU COULD BE MINEBy Sara Farizan Algonquin, $16.95. 
“I’ll find a way for us to be together,” Sahar, 17, tells her secret girlfriend. She’s been in love with Nasrin since they were 6 years old and dreams of marrying her. But they live in Tehran, where same-sex relationships are illegal and brutally punished. Sahar’s quest leads her deep into Iran’s underground LGBT scene. There she meets Parveen, a transwoman, whose circumstances reveal a surprising fact: Iranian law upholds transsexuals’ rights. The state even subsidizes gender-­reassignment surgery. Sahar starts to wonder: Could she become a man, sacrificing her identity to openly marry Nasrin? She devises a scheme that — even for a teenager drenched in the heady hormones of first love — feels staggeringly naïve. (Never mind that she fails to mention this plan to Nasrin, a fairly flat character, whose idea of devotion is amassing a prodigious collection of shoes.)        
Farizan’s prose is frank, funny and bittersweet, enjoyable even when Sahar’s rashness strains belief. And her secondary story lines ring out memorably, especially the speakeasy-style gatherings of Iran’s gay subculture and Sahar’s relationship with her father, a listless widower.        
ROSE UNDER FIREBy Elizabeth Wein Hyperion, $17.99. 
Shuttling Spitfires between British factories and air bases is the closest Rose, 18, a transport pilot and fledgling poet from Pennsylvania, is supposed to get to the Allied war effort. But on a rare flight over France, Rose pursues a self-piloted bomb and knocks it off course. Exultation turns to terror when Nazi fighter jets ground her plane in Germany and she is sent to Ravensbrück, the notorious women’s concentration camp.        
Presumed dead by her parents, Rose joins a ragtag prison family of French spies, Red Army servicewomen and Polish “rabbits,” the survivors of grotesque Nazi medical experiments. Their acts of solidarity help keep her alive. Her poetry also provides sustenance: an inmate offers bread in exchange for original verses and Rose recites a counting rhyme to survive a vicious beating.        
Wein’s second World War II adventure novel — the first, “Code Name Verity,” was highly praised last year — captures poignantly the fragility of hope and the balm forgiveness offers. Rose frames it best in a poem beseeching soldiers to fight “not to destroy all the world’s wrong, but to renew its good.”        
THE WAKING DARKBy Robin Wasserman Knopf, $17.99. 
Oleander, Kan., is dying: foreclosures are up and jobs are few. The townsfolk are a cast of meth cookers, doomsday preachers, sneering jocks, absentee parents, alienated kids and raging drunks. And then things get worse. A single day leaves a trail of gore: a mass shooting in a drugstore, a stabbing between lovers, a crucifixion, a gruesome vehicular homicide, the smothering of an infant. Things get so bad that the town is quarantined. Tanks and razor wire fences prevent escape. No one knows why. Is it connected to the secretive corporation leasing the town’s old power plant? A recent tornado? The Christmas Day fire in 1899 that wiped out the town’s founding citizens? Five teenage misfits struggle to help Oleander, or at least save themselves.        
Wasserman’s previous novel, “The Book of Blood and Shadow,” followed a single heroine driven by a murder to solve an ancient mystery; in “The Waking Dark,” life and death feel cheaper. She describes relentless killings with the kind of sensory fascination usually reserved for food criticism. There’s little promise of redemption, only the dream of escape and a sinister Hobbesian suggestion: What if we’re all barely repressing the evil within us?        
THE GOLDEN DAYBy Ursula Dubosarsky Candlewick, $15.99. 
This unsettling and atmospheric novel unfolds in 1967 at a girls’ school in Sydney. Once or twice a week, Miss Renshaw, a teacher with the charisma of Miss Jean Brodie, leads 11 of her students on a field trip to the Ena Thompson Memorial Gardens. While they write verses, Miss Renshaw flirts with the grounds­keeper; she says he is a poet and a conscientious objector. But one morning, the two adults lead the girls into a seaside cave to see Aboriginal paintings. Spooked, the girls leave first and wait outside, but the tide is coming in, “so without making a particular decision,” they “step back along the rocky edge of the world” and leave Miss Renshaw behind. She never returns. When they encounter her — or is it her ghost? — eight years later, her explanation of her disappearance is at once credible and at odds with the facts the girls have come to believe. Dubosarsky’s spare prose explores the space between innocence and adulthood. Shaped by the girls’ growing awareness of the world, her scenes are uneasy dreamscapes. Questions about responsibility, violence, sex, fear and death bloom beneath their placid surface. Unanswerable, they linger past the end of this slender but powerful volume.

"
Sports,"










If Hall of Fame starters are supposed to be durable, dominant winners, then Andy Pettitte just misses the cut. But he pitched a long time and won a lot, and that made him an indelible Yankee great.        


“I’ve had the success that I’ve had because of so many great players that have been around me,” Pettitte said Friday in announcing that this would be his final season.        
“Do I feel like I’ve dominated this sport as a pitcher? No, I don’t. Every outing for me, I feel like, has been an absolute grind, to tell you the truth. When I look at lineups and teams that I’m facing, it seems like every hitter’s hitting .300 off of me, you know?”        
It was vintage Pettitte, the moment in his news conference when you smiled and laughed a little, because you knew the sincerity behind the self-deprecation. It was mostly true, too. Not only did Pettitte never pitch a no-hitter, but he also never pitched a one- or a two-hitter. Opponents batted .270 off him. The league average over his career: .264.        
Pettitte had easy days, like all good pitchers, but not many. His self-evaluation was accurate. What separated Pettitte was the way he kept pushing himself to find a way out of trouble, pulling that cap down and fighting. He knew that the worst punishment he could give himself would be to disappoint his teammates, an unpardonable sin.        
“We laugh at him, because he’s always yelling at himself and talking to himself on the mound,” Derek Jeter said Friday. “It’s fun watching him beat himself up, because he expects to be perfect. Nobody’s perfect, but he has those expectations, and that’s the reason why he’s had so much success.”        
It is fitting that Pettitte’s most impressive statistic is his winning percentage — .627, at 103 games over .500. Wins and losses are often out of a pitcher’s control, as more and more young pitchers recognize. If they work seven innings, allow two runs and lose, they understand they have still done a good job.        
Pettitte never believed that. It was comical, indeed, to listen to him berate himself after such games, knowing that, had the offense scored a few more runs, his outlook would have been so different. Pettitte accepted all the responsibility, as he did in 2008 for his use of human growth hormone, the blot on an otherwise sterling reputation.        
“I know my heart, and I’ll tell you, I’ve never tried to cheat this game,” Pettitte said Friday.        
Pettitte retired once before, for the 2011 season. He said Friday that he would have stayed retired had General Manager Brian Cashman not called him the next spring. He intended to pitch only in 2012, but when he lost most of that season to a broken leg, he came back.        
All along, he said, he has known this would be it. He let another retiring Yankee, Mariano Rivera, have the spotlight all season, in every city, and said he planned to retire with a simple announcement the day after the season. Over lunch with Rivera in Toronto this week, Pettitte decided to make the announcement now.        
“It’s great,” Rivera said. “It’s giving him a chance to say thanks to the fans.”        
Barring a miracle playoff berth, Pettitte will pitch his final home game as a Yankee on Sunday, when the team honors Rivera. Jorge Posada last played in 2011, choking up by his locker after the playoff finale. Only Jeter will remain from the title teams of more than a decade ago, assuming he picks up his player option, as he has said he intends to do.        
“It’s been a long, hard year,” said Pettitte, 41, who is 10-10 with a 3.93 earned run average. “I can’t be happier with my decision. I’ve been retired and I know what it’s going to be like. It’s awesome, and I love it.”        
Jeter, who turns 40 in June, has never seemed tempted by retirement. He came up in 1995, like Pettitte, Rivera and Posada, but unlike them, he has no wife or children. Baseball may not be his entire life, but it is all he lets the public see, and he has made no concession to age.        
If Jeter’s ankle bothers him this winter, as he prepares for the season, you have to wonder if he would put himself through another year like this, which he has described as a nightmare. It is not in Jeter’s nature to want a gauzy farewell tour, and it’s no fun for him to be a figure of sympathy.        
Jeter rightly said that it was unrealistic to ever expect another foursome of long-term, mostly one-team stars to reach the majors together. “You always need to have an influx of young players come in and help organizations,” he said. “That’s how we were able to be successful, and I think that’s how any organization can continue or maintain success throughout the years.”        
The Yankees, however, do not appear to have any stars on the immediate horizon. If they did, those players would have been among the 56 to suit up for the team this season. Compounding the problem is the team’s goal to reduce its bloated payroll.        
Rivera and Pettitte clear salary by leaving, and in some ways that helps. But mostly they leave an organization at a point of deep uncertainty, content with their decisions and secure in their legacy.        
“It just feels right,” Pettitte said. “I just feel like my time here is done. My run’s over.”

MOSCOW — Russia’s Federal Security Service announced on Friday that it had seized a Greenpeace International ship and its crew after a series of protests at an offshore oil rig in the Arctic Ocean and that it would tow the ship to port in Murmansk to conduct an investigation.        


The seizure of the ship on Thursday night, which was carried out by armed border guards dropped by helicopter, threatened to escalate into a diplomatic confrontation, since the crew includes citizens of several countries, including one American. Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already issued a protest to the Dutch ambassador, because the ship, the Arctic Sunrise, is registered in the Netherlands and Greenpeace International is based there.        
The Federal Security Service, which oversees Russia’s border guards, said in a statement that the ship had been seized under laws governing Russia’s exclusive economic zone and that its activities would be reported to the country’s Investigative Committee for possible criminal charges. The committee’s regional branch, in a separate statement, said it was considering charges of piracy.        
The ship was seized in international waters near the Prirazlomnaya platform in the Pechora Sea, not far from the island of Novaya Zemlya. The platform, owned by the state-controlled energy giant Gazprom, is the first offshore oil rig in the Arctic. It was completed last year and is expected to begin pumping oil next spring. Greenpeace had sent its ship to the area last month to protest what it considers to be the risks of drilling for oil in such an environmentally fragile and largely unspoiled region.        
On Wednesday, two of the ship’s activists managed to scale the rig and were detained, prompting the initial Russian diplomatic protests. The border troops had also fired several warning shots during protests, but no one was injured during the storming of the ship on Thursday night, according to the security service and Greenpeace. Even so, the head of the organization’s Arctic oil campaign, Ben Ayliffe, said the seizure was unprecedented.        
“We have no idea why they’re being held,” he said of the ship’s crew. “Are they being charged? Why were they detaining our ship in international waters?”        
The security service said 27 people were on board, including 4 Russians. Greenpeace said the crew totaled 30. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear.        
Greenpeace officials in Moscow, who have monitored the ship’s activities from a “war room” in the organization’s office, said there had been no contact with the crew since Thursday night and no official response from the authorities beyond the security service’s statement on Friday, confirming the seizure. According to Greenpeace, at its current speed under tow, the ship will arrive in Murmansk on Monday.        
Before communications were severed, the activists had reported that the troops who boarded the ship “behaved quite correctly, but bureaucratically, the Soviet way,” said Vladimir Chuprov, a leader of Greenpeace Russia.        
In its statement, the security service, known by the initials F.S.B., said a search of the ship had uncovered “a large collection” of photographic and video equipment and small boats, suggesting unauthorized activity against Russia’s national security, though it did not explain the significance of the discovery.        
“What the F.S.B. is doing now is not to protect the national interest,” Mr. Chuprov said in an interview in the organization’s Moscow office. Instead, he added, referring to major energy companies now exploring the possibility of an energy boom in the Arctic, “the threat to the national interest is in the offices of Gazprom, Rosneft, Shell, BP or whatever.”

For the past 12 years, since his lauded “Esther Stories,” Peter Orner has been engaged in a strange, quiet and wonderful experiment. He has written four works of fiction — two novels and two story collections — all composed of canny snippets that build with subtle accumulative power to create books autobiographical in feel, if not necessarily in fact. In all but his first novel, “The Second Coming of Mavala Shikongo,” the books return to the same characters from startling vantage points; Orner is writing in spirals, moving restlessly out to embody imagined characters, but always returning to the Chicago and Fall River, Mass., family of his most frequent first-person narrator, a young man who is roughly his age. In each of his books, Orner’s crystalline sentences and his ability to pay close and sustained attention to small moments transform the ordinary elements of each story into an even more astonishing whole.        


“Last Car Over the Sagamore Bridge,” Orner’s new collection, is composed of 52 stories, most no longer than a few pages. There are many strands running through the weave of this book: one is a series featuring the above-mentioned family, another is a group of italicized first-person stories, another imagines people outside of the central character/narrator’s experience, like a woman who sells television antennas in a Mexico City plaza and a Serbian woman sitting in a coffee shop. Yet another strand observes famous people: Mary Todd Lincoln, Richard J. Daley, Ted Kennedy, Geraldo Rivera and Isaac Babel, one of many writers with whom Orner is in conversation. (Chekhov is another clear influence, as is the Evan S. Connell of “Mr. Bridge” and “Mrs. Bridge,” novels written in the same episodic manner Orner favors.)        
At his strongest, Orner can nail interior monologue in a way that recalls Grace Paley. Just listen to the voice of Walt Kaplan, a character who also appears in “Esther Stories” and in the novel “Love and Shame and Love”:        
“Would my head were a head of lettuce. I drove the last car over the Sagamore Bridge before the state police closed it off. The Cape Cod Canal all atempest beneath. No cars coming, no cars going. The bridge cables flapping like rubber bands. You think in certain circumstances a few thousand feet of bridge isn’t a thousand miles?”        
A writer who keeps returning to the same subjects runs a big risk. The reader can feel like an invisible observer in a room walled with mirrors, watching the author fascinated by the endless reflections of himself. Just when you think he’s finished examining this interesting feature, here it is again from a different angle. When Orner returns too often to the same beat or idea, he can almost reverse the effects of his truest gift, which is the ability to take elements we’ve seen before — the historical characters, the suburbs, the tight-knit Jewish families, Chicago — and, by the force of his fascination, make them thrillingly strange. This talent never fails Orner; yet when he looks too often at the same loss or character or mood, he teeters on the verge of returning the strange back to the familiar.        
Where would we be, though, without writers who take great risks? They are the interesting ones to follow from book to book. Sometimes the risky writer stumbles in his funambulist guise, and you wonder if he’s about to dive into the drink. In “Last Car Over the Sagamore Bridge,” Orner is especially daring with structure. Though the collection is organized into four loose sections based on what I interpret as loss, murder, longing and what remains after loss, it’s difficult to understand why these stories had to appear in the same book. The leaps from historical character to internal narrative to apparent transcription make a reader a little dizzy. Most great story collections — “Jesus’ Son,” by Denis Johnson; “Twilight of the Superheroes,” by Deborah Eisenberg; “Varieties of Disturbance,” by Lydia Davis — contain stories that feel as if they must be together, through character, thematic refraction or just a barely detectable urgency. They develop subtle arguments from beginning to end. Though every story in “Last Car Over the Sagamore Bridge” is excellent, incisive, moving, the collection as a whole never quite coheres: there are 52 passionate arguments being made in the 52 stories, but a person coming to Orner for the first time might feel that each story is mostly arguing with itself.        
Luckily, there are other ways of reading story collections than in a single linear sweep. A reader could dip into this book anywhere, go for a walk, and come back later to be moved differently. Or a reader could — and perhaps should — also read the collection as an integral part of a much greater whole, one still expanding and contracting and coiling inward, a living and breathing project that is evolving in a way that uncannily mimics memory, or life itself.

“Like most writers, I have one particular thing I can’t stop thinking about, wondering about, and in my case it’s the animating spirit of a thing, what we also call the soul.”        


Kathryn Davis, “Versailles,” reading group guide 
The story begins on a suburban street with sycamore trees planted at regular intervals, down which a slim, attractive schoolteacher named Miss Vicks, who is about 50, takes her dachshund on a walk. You read, “She was a real woman; you could tell by the way she didn’t have to move her head from side to side to take in sound.”        
And so you add “regal bearing” to the picture you see of Miss Vicks, and, loosely, an era — the late ’50s? the ’60s? early ’70s? — time and place forming as you read along, and then comes a phrase that makes the forming stutter. It’s after dinner, “when the blue-green lights of the scows, those slow-moving heralds of melancholy, would begin to appear in the night sky.”        
Scow? Isn’t that a type of boat, a barge of some sort? Scows in the sky? But now the dog is sniffing around one of the trees the way dogs do, so you think to yourself, maybe “scow” is another word for blimp, like the Goodyear blimp that passed over your street in the early 1960s, and you feel the melancholy you experienced as a 10-year-old girl sitting on your front porch on a summer night, reading messages the blimp flashed along its side that had nothing and everything to do with you. And Miss Vicks feels her childhood too, feels “all the Miss Vickses that had ever been” layered inside her “like tree rings around heartwood.” The chapter is called “Body-­without-Soul,” the book is called “Duplex,” and you’ve lived in a duplex so you think, “Oh, I know what this book is about.”        
There are parents who drink highballs and play canasta as darkness wells up and the fireflies come out. There are kids named Eddie, Mary, Carol, Roy, who wear T-shirts and plaid shorts, trade cards and stickers they keep in cigar boxes, play ball in the street; and when a car comes speeding toward them with headlights blazing, the kids yell “Heads up!” and scatter. Now the year is fixed in your head. It’s 1966 for sure. The only difference is the kids on your street yelled “Car!”        
And then you read this: “The car was expensive and silver-gray and driven by the sorcerer Body-without-Soul.” And you find out not only does Miss Vicks know him, they are romantically involved, and he can make things vanish or “vibrate at unprecedented frequencies,” including her privates, he can sow fear inside anything, and then you read that he can fit his entire hand inside her. Time stutters. What? His entire hand what?        
You read the phrase four times, trying to catch up, the way you tried to catch up when you were a kid and Henry, the teenager from next door, told a bunch of you a story about his finger and a girl. Finger? Girl? What? Then a flood of understanding horrified you, shamed and excited you, trailed you back into the house to the kitchen where dinner was ready, where your chicken potpie was waiting to be pierced with your fork and you stared at it.        
Oh. A scow is not a blimp. “Real woman” means something else entirely. And though he drives a car, and his name turns out to be Walter, the sorcerer is not a real man. He looks at the street but he doesn’t see the kids, he sees it “crawling with souls like the earth with worms. It was no secret that even the lowliest of the unruly, uncontainable beings living there could partake of love’s mystery, and his envious rage knew no bounds.”        
The real and the unreal are laminated so tightly in “Duplex” you find yourself suddenly lost; you don’t know where or when this book takes place, you don’t know what this book is about at all. And that is how it takes you in.        
When I finished “Duplex” I had the unshakable feeling that I’d only read half of the book, and the other half was still in there and if I wanted to finish it, I’d need to read it again. I wasn’t wrong. By then I’d fallen in love with Davis’s writing, what it did to me, that combination of horror and excitement that spilled out of the book, into my past, into the now, into everything around me. The novel is packed with ordinary things (tuna casserole, skinned knees, hot water heaters, red barrettes) and extraordinary things (robots the size of needles, “dactilo ports” in restrooms, those flying scows), and then there are things that fall somewhere in between: the word “aquanaut,” a purse-shaped thing called a “Mary bean” that can drift across the ocean to other continents, a convent named after a girl who was roasted on a brazier.

In the national consciousness, Harlem has usually been defined by two eras: the artistic and cultural explosion of the 1920s, known as the Harlem Renaissance, and the drug-fueled devastation that began in the 1950s and peaked in the late ’80s. The Harlem Renaissance has been well documented by its poets, novelists and essayists, as well as by a legion of scholars in the decades since. The long, depressing ghetto years were recounted most eloquently by James Baldwin, and by lesser mortals like sociologists, memoirists, politicians, Hollywood screenwriters and rappers. Today’s whiter Harlem of multimillion-­dollar brownstones and flashy eateries is already the subject of books, blogs and innumerable magazine travel articles.        


In her book “Harlem Nocturne: Women Artists and Progressive Politics During World War II,” Farah Jasmine Griffin, a professor at Columbia University, delves into a largely underexplored aspect of Harlem’s rich history: the years just before, during and immediately after World War II, a period of optimism, creativity and turmoil. Moreover, Griffin uses the lives of three female artists — the choreographer and dancer Pearl Primus, the writer Ann Petry and the composer and pianist Mary Lou Williams — as signposts through an era, in a work that paints the “greatest generation” in a much less flattering light than do the usual jingoistic accounts.        
Griffin’s narrative encompasses the war and the second great migration of blacks to the North from the South. She also highlights two movements that will be less familiar to contemporary readers: the Double V, or Double Victory, campaign, in which “black Americans fought . . . overseas for their country but also to be recognized as citizens at home”; and the Popular Front initiative, conceived by the Communist Party in response to “the economic crisis of the Great Depression and the rise of fascism.”        
“For black people,” Griffin writes of Double V, “the war provided an opportunity to accelerate their demands for equality. . . . Black Americans highlighted the distance between this ideal of America and the reality of ongoing racial inequality, often through the black press and civil rights organizations.”        
The Popular Front, meanwhile, “focused on culture as an especially important forum for educating and mobilizing audiences in support of an antifascist agenda.” Although by 1939 its official end had come, the idea of it “would continue throughout the war years. Without Popular Front venues like Café Society, or publications such as PM, a leftist newspaper, it is doubtful that Petry, Primus and Williams could have met with such success.”        
Griffin argues that her three main subjects “consistently confronted the darkness of our nation’s soul. They were critical of white supremacy and the excess of American capitalism. Yet, their art and their activism also denoted a firm belief in the transformative nature of social change.”        
None of these women were native New Yorkers. Primus was born in Trinidad and, as a child, relocated with her family to the city, where she was exposed to Afro-Caribbean dance, the innovations of Martha Graham and the sweaty swing style popular at the Savoy Ballroom.        
As an adult, Primus fused these movements with her own impressive physicality. Her ability to leap majestically high made her popular, and John Martin, the New York Times dance critic, praised her “tremendous inward power,” “fine dramatic sense” and “superb technique.” Of the three women in Griffin’s narrative, Primus was the most progressive politically, joining the Communist Party when it was still one of the few organized white movements to challenge Jim Crow and the violence that fed it. The F.B.I. opened a file on her in 1944.        
Petry was never a Communist but was published in Popular Front periodicals and served as “women’s editor,” columnist and features editor at the Harlem newspaper The People’s Voice, a left-leaning enterprise published by Adam Clayton Powell, the pastor and New York City councilman. Born and raised in Connecticut by an established middle-class New England family, the bookish Petry moved to Harlem with her husband, George, in 1938. With George inducted into the Army in 1943, Petry spent most of the war years on her own, writing, organizing, walking through Harlem and contemplating the constrained world of working-class black women. This reflection resulted in the 1946 novel “The Street,” about a single woman’s struggle to raise her son in Harlem. It sold more than 1.5 million copies, a first for a black woman. (Petry went on to publish two additional novels.)

Time hasn’t been kind to the white women who participated in the Harlem Renaissance. As philanthropists and activists, authors and patrons, they sought a place for themselves in that remarkable outpouring of African-American art during the 1920s and ’30s. Some, constrained by social expectations, effaced the records of their work. Others made it difficult for historians to treat them with much seriousness. What, after all, can we do with someone like Nancy Cunard, a British steamship heiress raised on a remote English estate, who felt no shame in proclaiming “I speak as if I were a Negro myself”?        


“Miss Anne” — the dismissive collective name given to white women — makes bit appearances in the literature of the era as a dilettante or imperious patron; later, she’s depicted as a thrill-seeking “slummer.” Always, she lurks in the shadows of her male counterparts in scholarly studies of the movement. But she was there, encouraging writers, underwriting cultural institutions, supporting progressive political causes. And many leading Harlem Renaissance figures — including Langston Hughes, Alain Locke and Nella Larsen — had reason to be grateful to her. At least for a while. Like everything else about Miss Anne, those relationships got complicated.        
In this remarkable work of historical recovery, Carla Kaplan, author of “Zora Neale Hurston: A Life in Letters,” does well by a group of women who got so much wrong. She resurrects Miss Anne as a cultural figure and explores the messy contradictions of her life, moving her from the periphery of a story about white patronage and boundary-testing interracial liaisons to the center. With a focus on six of the roughly 60 white women active in the Harlem Renaissance, Kaplan delineates Miss Anne as a counterpart to the better known flapper or “new woman” of the Roaring Twenties. But this is really a collection of individual stories, a group biography that lets the idiosyncrasies of the individual women shine through. “Negrotarians,” as the writer and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston called Harlem’s white patrons, were a diverse crew, full of good intentions, startling blind spots and astonishing self-confidence.        
“Miss Anne in Harlem” gives just passing attention to the era’s quieter patrons, like Mary White Ovington, a founder of the N.A.A.C.P., or the philanthropist Amy ­Spingarn. Kaplan’s eye is on the women who raised more complicated questions about racial self-identity. So we meet Cunard, a self-appointed expert on African-­American life, who organized and self-published a massive 855-page anthology, “Negro,” an “entirely documentary” record of the race, even though she’d made only brief trips to America and had never been to Africa. And we encounter Charlotte Osgood Mason, an imperious anti-Semite and collector of African art, who demanded that her Harlem protégés call her “Godmother.” It would be easy to dismiss such women as high-handed interlopers. But Kaplan urges us to take them seriously and to use their sometimes overwrought, even outrageous, expressions of cross-racial solidarity as a way to understand a broader set of questions about racial identity.        
The book is full of fresh discoveries. ­Kaplan learns that Lillian Wood, author of the radical 1920s anti-lynching novel “Let My People Go,” was actually white, not black, as other scholars have imagined. She reveals that Josephine Cogdell Schuyler, the white daughter of a Klan member and the wife of the African-American journalist George Schuyler, collaborated anonymously on much of her husband’s work and used several pseudonyms to write for his journal, conveying the false impression of a community of white women who shared her anti-racist views.        
But the focus of the book remains squarely on the larger issues of racial identity raised by Miss Anne’s deep personal identification with African-American life. Miss Anne wanted to suggest that race was a constructed ideal, yet she stumbled over the internal contradictions of her impulses. She fought against racial essentialism and the perverse logic of America’s one-drop rule, which proclaimed that even a trace of African heritage made one black, but she also celebrated the seeming vitality and distinctiveness of black culture. Josephine Cogdell Schuyler wrote in her diary the night before her wedding: “To my mind, the white race, the Anglo-Saxon especially, is spiritually depleted. America must mate with the Negro to save herself.” In a similar expression of romantic racialism, the philanthropist Charlotte Osgood Mason lauded “the creative impulse throbbing in the African race.” As Kaplan suggests, white men could sometimes get away with ideas like this; a dose of black culture offered a useful inoculation against the debilitating sterility of the industrial world. But white women who sought an intimate connection with African-­American life were seen as traitors to the race, even sexual deviants.

Like most serious American novels about war, “The Woman Who Lost Her Soul” wants to explain the country in its entirety. Of course, that’s a tall order, but Bob Shacochis doesn’t lack for ambition — his novel is about not one but two contemporary wars, both of them endless: the war on terror and the war on drugs. It’s a novel about the United States that takes place largely outside the United States, if you discount the many scenes set on various world-renowned American golf courses. Although the book strives to paint a full portrait of its panoply of complicated characters — both in warrior mode and on the home front — the problem with endless war in a narrative is that the writer ends up not with “War and Peace” but with war and . . . more war. One follows from battle to battle, from firefight to firefight, from political assassination to terror attack to revenge-taking, without resolution, because the endless war can conceive of no resolution: resolution, which makes a narrative complete, is not part of this story.        


“The Woman Who Lost Her Soul” opens in the chaotic, corrupt landscape of Haiti in the 1990s, an unpredictable place more or less run (as it still is, in part) by U.N. peacekeepers. This is a country Shacochis knows well; he covered America’s 1994 intervention and occupation and wrote about it in his intelligent nonfiction book “The Immaculate Invasion,” which showed real sensitivity and sympathy to soldiers, as well as an understanding of how Haiti works and doesn’t work. Those qualities serve him again in “The Woman Who Lost Her Soul.”        
As usual in Western novels set there, Haiti provides Shacochis with a torrid, primitive, dangerous backdrop for the shenanigans of white people. Many arrangements in the book are made on the terrace of the Hotel Oloffson, Port-au-Prince’s infamous ramshackle expat enclave. Love affairs begin in upscale restaurants. Other things happen (including sex between outsiders) at nighttime Vodou ceremonies.        
The human-rights lawyer Tom Harrington seems to be the book’s hero during the first section. At a swank restaurant uptown, hanging out with an American movie director who wants to interview the rebels to the north, Harrington meets the woman of the title, who could be the identical twin of the “pixie-ish Hollywood actress who starred in romantic comedies . . . one of Harrington’s favorites, the standard-bearer for every Sally-next-door heartthrob fantasy the studios could confect.” This glamorous, soulless beauty turns out to be Jackie Scott. Jackie is “a remote angel” with “golden” hair and blue eyes, in her mid-20s, and ostensibly a photographer with a degree in ethnobotany. As the novel progresses, the golden-haired Jackie, under one of her many aliases, is often naked or topless, wears boyfriend boxers that sit low on her slender hips, and looks great even when wounded, even when vomiting or drunk, even when in withdrawal from drugs. It turns out she’s not just an ethnobotanist. She is also the daughter of the man who, for all intents and purposes, runs the world.        
This woman who lost her soul is a male fantasy, an object of male regard, and, unlike the novel’s big male characters, she is seen from within only while she’s a teenager and on a few other discrete occasions. You’d imagine the novel could not help foundering on the shoals of this gilded, pornographic creature — yet the world Shacochis presents is believable enough and important enough to allow the book to sail on over the annoyance of the fantastical siren at its heart. I cannot reveal the strange contortions Jackie goes through or the levels of being and nothingness she experiences without spoiling some of the book’s many denouements. But suffice it to say that as you become more enmeshed in this paranoid and persuasive presentation of the world we live in, Jackie (or Dottie, or Renee) becomes slowly more human, less a goddess, in spite of her almost mythic travails.        
In fact it’s a man’s world Shacochis delineates, and it’s probably fair that he turns his heroine into a man’s fantasy of what constitutes female power. The world the book creates is one of secret Delta Force missions, of Pakistani peacekeeper/drug dealers, of mesmerizing Vodou priests, of Croatian revenge seekers, of spies and “gooks” and “wogs” (Shacochis’s characters’ vocabulary), and — at its heart, often at Jackie’s side — Eville Burnette, a handsome, straight-shooting American soldier with perfect pecs and glutes who comes out of the West from a horse-­wrangling mom and hunter dad, a fighter who is willing to do what he’s assigned even if it doesn’t square with the America he has for so long felt in his veins, especially when he polishes his dad’s old guns or when he fishes or when he ventures into what’s left of our pristine wilderness.

Instead of dreading the day Sue Grafton reaches the end of the alphabet, her faithful readers should be concerned about her plans for a new decade. It’s still the materialistic 1980s in W IS FOR WASTED (Marian Wood/Putnam, $28.95), so Kinsey Millhone, the well-nigh immortal sleuth in this enduring series, still has time to play her rebel role simply by living a spartan existence in a world of greedy narcissists. How sweet it is to see the California private eye back in her garage apartment, hanging out with her 88-year-old landlord, wearing jeans and boots and pulling out a single dress to get her through formal occasions. It’s also fun to watch her at work, taking notes on index cards, typing reports on a Smith-Corona and — here’s what really matters — communicating with people face to face.        


More than her casual style, it’s really Kinsey’s code of ethics that’s out of sync with the values of the period. “I’m a person of order and regulation, discipline and routine,” she says, explaining why “the anarchy of the disenfranchised is worrisome.” But when a homeless man is found dead on the beach, a scrap of paper bearing her name in his pocket, she joins three of his friends, also homeless, in an effort to find out why he needed a private eye.        
Once it’s revealed that the dead man left a legacy of almost $600,000 to a total stranger — namely Kinsey — the focus shifts from a group of people without any worldly possessions to three grown children, disinherited by the father they despised but fighting tooth and nail for his money. Expanding this theme of rampant greed is another narrative that also begins with a dead man, a “morally shabby” but appealingly human P.I. who tried to blackmail a shady scientist desperate to hold on to his lucrative grant.        
A painstaking plot wrangler, Grafton carefully merges both narratives in a sad but satisfying conclusion. The problems arise from her efforts to work Kinsey’s personal history into the story. Although orphaned as a child, Kinsey has acquired quite a few relatives over the years and picks up more here. But while this supports her never-ending quest for “what I longed for most — stability, closeness, belonging,” it’s an awkward plot stretch. Kinsey will probably do better bonding with Ed, the Japanese bobtail cat who’s come into her life.        
John Lawton’s stylish spy thriller THEN WE TAKE BERLIN (Atlantic Monthly, $26) is a splendid introduction to John Wilfrid (Wilderness) Holderness, born a Cockney guttersnipe, trained in various criminal enterprises by his grandfather and transformed into a British intelligence operative during World War II. Wilderness is a free agent (“What you would probably call a gumshoe”) in 1963 when he’s summoned to New York by Frank Spoleto, an ex-C.I.A. agent who was his accomplice in the black-market trade back in Berlin — and who now asks him to pull off one last smuggling job, this time involving human merchandise.        
Nell Burkhardt, a Berliner who’s an aide to Willy Brandt in 1963 but was Wilderness’s lover during the war, is also drawn into the plot. This adds a certain frisson, as does President Kennedy’s scheduled speech at the Berlin Wall. But that narrative pales beside the enthralling story of Wilderness’s adventures in espionage (“It was just a game, a game of manners and illusions and deceptions . . . a game he could play”) and Lawton’s harrowing descriptions of life in the battered nations of Europe in 1945, when the war was officially over but never seemed to end.        
New York must have been a helluva town in 1846, just after the newly established Police Department sent out its first “copper stars” to impose law and order. Timothy Wilde, who rescued child prostitutes in Lyndsay Faye’s rip-roaring novel “The Gods of Gotham,” returns in SEVEN FOR A SECRET (Amy Einhorn/Putnam, $26.95) as the protector of lovely Lucy Adams, who lost her family to slave catchers. Although kidnapping free people of color and selling them into slavery is a crime, capturing runaway slaves and returning them to their Southern masters is both legal and profitable. So a staunch abolitionist like Timothy may have to flout the law he has sworn to protect, a matter of conscience that eludes his brother, a ward boss whose personal life is devoted to “narcotics, alcohol, bribery, violence, whoring, gambling, theft, cheating, extortion, sodomy, spying and forgery.” Clearly, a man for his unruly times.        
Nordic authors aren’t usually a barrel of laughs, but the Icelandic crime novelist Arnaldur Indridason seems to be having a quiet joke in BLACK SKIES (Thomas Dunne/Minotaur, $25.99). The topic raised here — the venality of leaders of industry and their cynical bankers — is a serious political matter to a nation recovering from an economic meltdown. And the conclusion reached — that most of us, given half a chance, would sell our souls for a buck — is properly depressing. But because the lead detective in this series, the reliably dour Inspector Erlendur Sveinsson, seems to be off contemplating the flawed nature of humanity, the case goes to Sigurdur Oli, a less introspective and, frankly, rather thick colleague. Indridason seems to find something touching in Oli’s blunt manner and crude tastes, but he’s as decent a detective as they come. And in the end, let’s hand it to him, he does catch his man.

Samantha Geimer says she really wants you to leave her alone. Really. She’s a 50-year-old woman now, dividing her time between Hawaii and Nevada with her husband and three sons. But 36 years ago in Hollywood, when she was only 13, she was plied with Champagne and a quaa­lude, photographed topless, and raped by the 43-year-old Roman Polanski. And ever since, her privacy has been busted. Any time Polanski is in the news, Geimer is once again thrown back into reliving her invaded girlhood, an unwilling principal player in a story never satisfactorily concluded. And Polanski is in the news often, since the artistically impressive, Oscar-winning, Polish-French director who made “Chinatown,” “Rosemary’s Baby” and “The Pianist” fled the United States in 1978 before final sentencing. The wrath of American justice, affronted as much by his defiance as by his crime, awaits him if he ever returns. It’s a story that has become grimy with symbolism about Hollywood privilege, 1970s California indulgence, imperfect parenting, judicial pandering and inconsistency, tortured creative temperament, and the rights of rape victims.        


Enough already, Geimer says. She’s forgiven Polanski, so now move along, please. Although I’m sure she understands perfectly well that the trade-off for having her say (and enjoying any ka-ching that comes of it) by publishing “The Girl: A Life in the Shadow of Roman Polanski” is embracing the opposite of being left alone, at least in the publicity-­generating short run. Written with the journalist Judith Newman and with input from Geimer’s lawyer, Lawrence Silver, “The Girl” is a feisty, almost jaunty you’re-not-the-boss-of-me account of a really awful thing and its long aftermath. It’s also an exercise that uses autobiography as a feminist tactic for Geimer to own her sexuality, acknowledge her crummy but eventually better lifestyle choices in the years after the rape, and cash in on her right to tell the story her way. (Polanski cashed in on his in 1984 with his autobiography, “Roman.”) The credit goes to Newman, I’m guessing, for establishing the lively, pugnacious narrative voice, one that manages to sound simultaneously like a provocative kid (Geimer’s first impression of Polanski: “Ew, there’s this guy who’s like my size and sort of looks like a ferret”) and a wised-up adult (“There comes a time when you need to let it go — unless you don’t want to. And then, in a sense, it’s your problem”).        
Geimer would also like you to lay off her mother, for Pete’s sake. True, Mom (she’s always Mom here), a divorced, ambitious, aspiring actress in the ultimate movie town, was blithely pleased to send her adolescent daughter off, unaccompanied, for a vaguely explained “photo shoot” with a famous and powerful man. But, the narrator takes convoluted pains to explain, that doesn’t make Mom an opportunist — let alone, even worse, a pimp. Mom was just . . . you know, freewheeling Mom in a permissive culture, who taught Samantha and her older sister, Kim, that sex was a healthy and natural thing. If you want to get mad, Geimer says, take it out on Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, now deceased, whose preening self-regard compromised his integrity in presiding over Polanski’s case. (Marina Zenovich’s strong 2008 documentary, “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,” digs deeper into the court’s own culpability in the matter.)        
Nothing in “The Girl” is likely to change the strong opinions of anyone who already has strong opinions about the balance of sexual power between men and women, the connection between the morals of an artist and the value of his art, or the responsibilities of justice and punishment. But maybe it’ll get you — yes, you, you gawker — to leave Samantha Geimer alone. As she puts it, “How I’ve wished, over the years, I’d never told anyone about that poke in the butt.” And wasn’t that what second-wave feminists fought for: our butts, ourselves?

Julian Barnes has disregarded the conventional boundaries between literary genres for as long as he’s been publishing books. So it should come as no surprise that “Levels of Life,” a putative grief memoir about the loss of his wife, the literary agent Pat Kavanagh, is part history, part meditative essay and part fictionalized biography. The pieces combine to form a fascinating discourse on love and sorrow.        


Each of the three essays — “The Sin of Height,” “On the Level” and “The Loss of Depth” — begins with the same concept: that of putting together “two things that have not been put together before.” In the first essay, the 19th-century photographer and inventor Gaspard-Félix Tournachon, later known simply as Nadar, combines photography and aeronautics as the first aerial photographer. In the second essay, Barnes narrates an imaginary affair between the actress Sarah Bernhardt and Fred Burnaby, an English traveler and adventurer. In the third essay, love unites Barnes and his wife — and persists even after Kavanagh’s death. A series of coincidences links the three essays: Burnaby and Bernhardt also rode in balloons; Nadar photographed Bernhardt several times; Nadar was a devoted husband despite his many affairs, and he nursed his wife in her last illness, as Barnes nursed his.        
Elements from the book’s first two sections reappear as metaphors in the third: “You feel absurd, like one of those dressed mannequins, surrounded by skulls, that Nadar photographed in the Catacombs. Or like that boa constrictor,” belonging to Bernhardt, “which took to swallowing sofa cushions and had to be shot dead.” But the facts of Barnes’s life without Kavanagh don’t need metaphors. “I look at my key ring (which used to be hers): it holds only two keys, one to the front door of the house and one to the back gate of the cemetery,” he writes. “I used to rub oil into her back because her skin dried easily; now I rub oil into the drying oak of her grave marker.”        
Kavanagh doesn’t appear until the last of the three essays. She casts a shadow over the playful and digressive preliminary chapters, and in this new, lower light they seem a defense against grief’s identity-warping madness — as if Barnes worried that writing about the death of the beloved might kill her all over again, this time in prose. The third essay, bracingly precise, is the emotional center of the book.        
Barnes here is simultaneously wise, funny and devastating: “When you change your make of car, you suddenly notice how many other cars of the same sort there are on the road. They register in a way they never did before. When you are widowed, you suddenly notice all the widows and widowers coming towards you.” When he sees his Congolese postman, moved to a new route, for the first time after Kavanagh’s death and must explain that she is gone, he observes, “I was thinking, even as I was speaking: now I’m having to do it all again in French.” During a late-night cab ride home, Barnes’s driver asks: “ ‘Your wife, be asleep, will she?’ After a silent choke, I gave the only reply I could find. ‘I hope so.’ ”        
Memoir is often accused of being the most indulgent literary genre, and the first two essays, intellectually and imaginatively rigorous, provide a kind of apology for the third. But despite all expectations, those two are the ones that occasionally wax sentimental; the dialogue between Burnaby and Bernhardt can blush somewhat purple. In the third essay, Barnes refers to the dangerous lure of grief’s “self-pity, isolationism, world-scorn, an egotistical exceptionalism: all aspects of vanity.” His articulation of his anguish is well served by his leeriness, as the book’s last section is one of the least indulgent accounts of mourning I have ever read. I almost wish “Levels of Life” consisted only of its 56 shattering pages.

Ben Dolnick’s first two novels, “Zoology” and “You Know Who You Are,” were intelligent, amiable books, about the coming-of-age of middle-class male protagonists. They were warmhearted and strikingly perceptive about their heroes’ feelings, the petty as well as the generous. But their painstaking rendering of childhood and adolescent struggles felt at moments overly wide-eyed, almost twee.        


His third, “At the Bottom of Everything,” is far more sophisticated. Dolnick has retained his strengths — his sensitive gauge for emotional states and his empathy — but his writing is more taut, more piquant, not only observant but wry in its depiction of human fallibility. The result is a lively, often funny book about being young and smart and confused, fumbling through life in a middle-class American sort of way. There is tragedy here, too, but it is dressed in such ordinary clothes that it feels less like tragedy as we are used to it in art and more like the heartbreak we know from experience, the kind that comes from having the misfortune to care about other people.        
At the heart of the story is Adam Sanecki, an appealing yet somewhat callow Ivy League graduate a few years out of school, living in his hometown, Washington. He has spent years trying not to think about his former best friend, Thomas Pell. Adam’s current antipathy extends to Thomas’s parents: he recalls with a wince that he had even, “one especially, unproud morning, turned and speed-walked out of Safeway because I’d seen Thomas’s dad, or someone who looked like Thomas’s dad, rooting around in the bin of red peppers.”        
Adam isn’t so lucky the next time, when he spots Thomas’s mom at a drugstore on Wisconsin Avenue: Mrs. Pell sees him before he can slink off. Chatting with her, Adam silently laments: “Childhood friends, given a decade or two, turn into strangers. Their parents don’t.” Only now Mrs. Pell looks “pale and defeated.” She implores Adam to write to Thomas, who is apparently in India. Adam says he will. (He won’t.)        
The encounter dredges up memories. We learn that Adam and Thomas became friends in middle school, where Thomas had been universally acknowledged as the smartest kid in their class. Adam was the more socially adept. Thomas turned to him for advice about girls, and for several years, they were a good pair. Adam also came to love Mr. and Mrs. Pell, who were warm and sophisticated, more intellectual than his mother and stepfather. Mr. Pell read his English papers; Mrs. Pell listened to Adam more attentively than any adult ever had. (Dolnick is particularly skilled at rendering the texture of these relationships, which are at once ordinary and vitally important to the people involved.)        
Since then, Thomas’s life has taken a turn for the worse. He dropped out of college and spent the better part of the next few years lying on his parents’ couch before taking off for India. His e-mails to his parents are sporadic and increasingly unhinged.        
After their chance meeting at the drugstore, Mrs. Pell steps up her e-mails to Adam. She says Thomas is “drowning.” She writes: “I’m asking you to care. . . . He never had another friend like you. I think he might still say you’re his best friend, even now.”        
Adam ignores her.        
He is not a monster; he’s just a regular guy consumed by his own problems: a breakup that leads him to spend far too much time on Facebook, tortured by his ex’s chirpy status updates; his failure to launch a career. (At 26, he notes dryly, “no one wanted to know now what I wanted to be; they wanted to know what I did.”) What he does is work as a tutor — “which seemed, along with being a nanny, to be one of the loopholes people my age had discovered in the professional world.”        
In the context of his professional and romantic missteps, Adam starts to take on a blandly sympathetic everyman quality, but the book regains its footing once its focus returns to the Pells. It turns out Adam and Thomas share a secret, something they did that had horrific consequences for another person. “At the Bottom of Everything” is essentially a book about guilt, specifically the kind that results from a small mistake whose reverberations are disproportionately large. This secret proved after a while to be too much for Adam and Thomas’s friendship. Dolnick nails the casual brutality with which teenagers drop people they were once close to: this friendship’s end was sealed the moment Adam, whose popularity, unlike Thomas’s, was on the rise, “stopped saying hi to him in the halls,” leaving Thomas pretty much friendless.

Truly memorable experiences — whether they involve a lover, a pinot noir or a novel so good you have to keep putting it down just to savor the afterimage of a particular phrase — tend to generate a certain anticipatory tension. Will the follow-up repeat the magic? Or will the lover be distracted the next time around, the wine underwhelming?        


When it comes to Paul Harding’s second novel, “Enon,” the sin of harboring high expectations is both foreordained and forgivable; it’s the tax on talent. How good was Harding’s debut, “Tinkers”? One might have to go as far back as Marilynne Robinson’s “Housekeeping” to find a first novel that declared itself with such authority. Harding’s associative flights — his twisting, turning lyricism — were stunning, his ability to stress the physical world into extended metaphor downright Melvillean. This was prose that could lead 10,000 M.F.A. students to ruin.        
In “Enon,” Harding’s gifts are again everywhere on display. A forest path is “lined with wet, soggy leaves that felt like vellum . . . up from the pagelike, pulpy folds of which little white moths innocently spun into the wrong season with nearly every step.” The brass sphere representing the sun in the center of an orrery (a mechanical model of the solar system) is “so polished and reflective it not only threw the room’s light back out, as if generating the glow itself, but also seemed to possess depth, as if one might be able to plunge into its fish-eyed fathoms, into another brassy room.” This is beautiful work.        
So has lightning struck twice? Alas, no. The problem is that while the de­centered story in “Tinkers” (which follows George Washington Crosby’s thoughts as he lies dying) invited Harding’s irrepressible attention to wander, “Enon” demands a closer focus because of the terrible sun at its center: the accidental death of the 13-year-old daughter of George’s grandson Charlie Crosby. This should force certain adjustments; the gravity of grief makes anything that escapes its pull — metaphysical ponderings, whimsical asides, stunning prose — instantly suspect. A mother might notice a chip in the molding as she’s told of her son’s death (and we recognize this as the mind’s defense against the unacceptable), but if she continues to notice, or imagines in detail the life of the carpenter who built the house, something’s wrong. Grief militates against seeing.        
Charlie, however, sees everything. He speculates, digresses. Only hours after his daughter’s death, he considers the mortician’s “charcoal gray suit” and “close-cropped, receding hair,” and confesses he’s “embarrassed to call him Rick” because “the family had always referred to him as Ricky.” Picking out the T-shirt his daughter is to be cremated in, he thinks to check if it has an “inappropriate design,” then wonders: “What could be inappropriate, though? . . . What’s appropriate? Who at the funeral parlor’s going to undress and dress her? Rick? Some guy in a rubber smock and gloves? There might well be health codes or laws about what clothes people can be cremated in. . . . Who, I thought, is going to trundle my daughter into the fire?”        
If Charlie’s voice seems a bit too alert under the circumstances — what minute in a man’s life could match the somnambulistic horror of having to choose clothes for his daughter’s cremation? — it’s because, channeling his creator’s gifts, he’s unsuited to the task at hand. Speaking his pain, he misses the feeling of it. Embroidering on everything he sees, he undercuts our belief with every stitch. The grammar of silence is unfamiliar to him.        
The result, unfortunately, can be jarring. Invaded the night before the funeral by his Keilloresque in-laws, “gigantic Finns from Minnesota” who “skied and biked and hiked together,” Charlie gives us their relative heights to the inch, grouses about their “intimidatingly good physical and moral health,” then describes how the sisters, who look “like Olympic athletes,” trap his grieving wife between them and begin going through pictures of the dead child. “Look at this one, Susie. She’s so cute in this canoe. . . . Look at the face she’s making here. Jesus, she looked just like you.” Recounted with weird relish, the scene leaves a reader smiling queasily, attempting to correlate this relative blitheness on the eve of a daughter’s funeral with any known expression of grief.

Augustine famously asked God to grant him chastity but not yet. In “Confessions of a Latter-day Virgin,” her account of remaining chaste and Mormon well into her 30s, Nicole Hardy pleads with God to just take it from her already — because if he wants her to wait until marriage for sex, as her church demands, he’s going to have to toss her something she’s been unable to find on her own. As she writes in typically winking fashion after a grueling bout of online Mormon dating: “If the kind of man I want exists within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he is rare, not unlike the endangered red panda of the Himalayas. Show me an LDS man who’s wickedly funny, politically liberal, brighter than the average bear and uncommitted to 1950s gender roles, and I will show you the shaggy tail and waddling gait of the Ailurus fulgens, its mischievous mouth rife with bamboo.”        


Hardy’s story is that of a headstrong, dramatic dreamer who grew up wanting much more for herself than the marriage and children her church deemed necessary for eternal life, and yet remained wary of defying her faith’s conception of spiritual fulfillment. She aspires to write and she aspires to meet a man like the one described above, and in the meantime her heart is broken by the fact that non-Mormon men who might fulfill her are off limits.        
There are wisecracks to spare and no shortage of wry asides. But laced as it is with a tortured strain of self-denial as rare in secular American culture as that red Himalayan panda, Hardy’s story may seem appealing — and comprehensible — only to those who have been raised in conservative Christian churches. Through quite a bit of the book she defensively chafes against the numerous platitudes issued by her fellow faithful. Yet while she has good reason to erupt at the bad theology — at one point she receives a patronizing e-mail from a bishop telling her she should repent for going on vacation with an unmarried man, because he suspects sin has transpired when it did not — the memoir can read uncomfortably like a string of tantrums.        
When Hardy writes of what brings her joy outside church — salsa dancing, scuba diving, travel to Cuba — her words take on an inviting poetic radiance. But the Mormon Church also brought her joy, she says after leaving her faith, and what’s missing here is a record of the ways in which “it made my life feel purposeful, and centered and right.” She doesn’t really make clear why the church inspires her to sacrifice the many opportunities for sexual pleasure that come her way, whether she’s waitressing in her hometown, Seattle, or living for a spell in the Cayman Islands. We know she fears the loss of her family’s love if she turns her back on this spiritual home, but its comforts never take substantial shape on the page.        
“I am, and always will be, who God made me,” she writes with admirable confidence soon after she makes her break with the church (though not with belief). Who is the God who made this particular woman, a woman with a taste for new places, able to bring back these wise sentences as souvenirs: “How is it I can feel peaceful, glorified, connected in the literal presence of sharks? That next to them, I can forget to be afraid? And sitting still in the house of God, I feel myself drowning.” Who would Hardy say this God is? We don’t see enough of this deity in her book. A fuller glimpse would have made this a consistently, rather than fitfully, powerful document of what a liberated woman’s faith looks and sounds like.

Jesse James, the young Confederate guerrilla turned outlaw, rose to fame and descended into infamy in less than two decades — from the mid-1860s to his death in 1882 — in the crucible of a frontier struggling to establish law and order, in circumstances that birthed the very notion of the Wild West.        


He, along with his older brother, Frank, crossed the belly of the continent as a bank and train robber wanted in several counties and states, a criminal entrepreneur and celebrity who used contemporary media skillfully to build a legacy among common people — styling himself as a Robin Hood-like gentleman bandit who was on their side, against the ham-handed (or corrupt) political establishment.        
Two narratives of parallel interest and construction — “The Lost Cause,” by James P. Muehlberger, which concentrates on the justice system’s pursuit of the Jameses; and “Shot All to Hell,” by Mark Lee Gardner, which zeros in on a single, chaotic bank robbery and subsequent chase — recount the oft-told tale of the brothers and their gang, from the bloody days of disunion on the Missouri-Kansas frontier to Frank’s trial and Jesse’s end with a bullet in his skull.        
Both books read like extended episodes of “Law & Order,” set in the Midwest, in the years immediately after the Civil War. Both provide detailed accountings of Jesse’s and his fellows’ movements. And both are equal parts violent melodrama and meticulous procedural, wrapped in vivid packages with enough bloody action to engage readers enthralled by tales of good versus evil.        
The James brothers were born of Kentucky stock transplanted to Missouri, as were many of the settlers in the fertile Missouri River bottomland that spawned wide-open towns like Independence, Gallatin, Liberty, St. Joseph and West Port (later annexed by Kansas City). A good deal of those who founded farms and communities there were slaveholders, which made the northern territory along the Missouri-Kansas border an enclave of Southern sympathy.        
During the Civil War, Missouri was divided. After the conflict ended, the victors sought to integrate the state fully into the Union. But the defeated fought efforts at reconstruction and reconciliation through political and extralegal means, including armed resistance, assassinations, robberies and unrest just short of outright rebellion.        
Jesse James gained some notoriety as a teenage guerrilla and bushwhacker. His brother rode with William Quantrill in brutal raids on the Kansas towns dividing slave from free territory, including an attack on Lawrence on Aug. 21, 1863, in which more than 200 men and boys were massacred.        
Gardner’s book introduces the brothers at the start of their prolonged crime spree, but the heart of his story is the 1876 Northfield, Minn., raid and its aftermath, which he depicts in rollicking style. The messy robbery, which lasted all of 10 minutes, teamed the experienced James boys with the tough and charismatic Youngers, and resulted in the deaths of both outlaws and innocents. Jesse James, after several more robberies, was cornered in his rented home in St. Joseph, in April 1882, and assassinated. He was 34. Six months later, Frank surrendered in Jefferson City, Mo., and the next year was put on trial in Gallatin.        
Called the “Trial of the Century,” State of Missouri v. Frank James was a mega-media event and a landmark in Missouri jurisprudence that involved the participation of some of the state’s most important legal talent. For “The Lost Cause,” Muehlberger, a practicing lawyer, pored through legal files that no one else had examined for over a century. He superbly describes the trial and its personalities, building suspense and revealing much about the time, the character of the place and the personality of Frank James. He also submits new evidence that puts a distinctly different spin on the brothers’ motives and exploits.        
After Frank James was acquitted — “the jury,” Muehlberger writes, was so sympathetic to him and “indignant at the state for prosecuting a man they regarded as the last returning soldier of the Confederate cause that no amount of evidence would have convinced them to convict” — he went on to a prosperous life before dying in 1915, at age 72. His admirers “celebrated the legend of the noble guerrilla, a farm boy forced to fight to protect friend and family from Northern domination,” Muehlberger observes. “Having been a symbol of this myth, it is perhaps fitting that Frank James became its beneficiary during his trial” — even as Jesse became a victim of his own myth and criminal past, dying at the hands of a killer supposedly paid by the state of Missouri to murder him.        
Indeed, the James boys stood tall at the end of things, their stories presaging a new century’s preoccupations and inventions: media-driven celebrity and the romanticism of the “public enemy” who reveled in the hero worship while lightening the wallets of those in power. Jesse James paid a big price but achieved the ultimate victory, at least in the public relations battle for the hearts and minds of Americans.

Virtually everything worthwhile written about American poverty is essentially about moral failure. It is the failure of the society (according to liberals) or of the poor themselves (according to conservatives) or of institutions and individuals together in a complex combination (according to centrists). Poverty violates core American values. It challenges the American dream’s promise of prosperity for anyone who works hard, a faith central to the national ethic. Richard Wright called this faith “the truth of the power of the wish.”        


The dream dies in the early pages of Sasha Abramsky’s intricate study, “The American Way of Poverty.” Abramsky, a freelance journalist who has written for The Nation, The Atlantic and other publications, regards inequality “as a social control mechanism” supported by financial interests’ belief in “the desirability of oligarchy.” He endorses the notion, popular on the left, that poverty is not just a glitch but a feature of the American system, “a corrosive brew,” he writes, “capable of eating away at the underpinnings of democratic life itself.”        
His observant reporting is less doctrinaire than these grand assertions. He travels the United States meeting the poor, whose wrenching tales he inserts in tight vignettes among data-driven analyses and acute dissections of government programs. The country he portrays is damaged by indifference at high levels — his American heroes are not in Congress or boardrooms — but is rescued here and there by caring citizens at the grass roots, their inventive programs achieving small successes.        
Abramsky presents himself as an heir to Michael Harrington, whose book “The Other America,” published in 1962, awakened parts of the political establishment to the shadows of poverty beneath the country’s gleaming affluence. But that work came during the civil rights movement, which was already sensitizing Americans to social injustice. Fifty-one years later, injustice does not readily incite outrage. This is so even as millions of middle-class Americans, in free fall during the economic collapse that began around 2008, have had a taste of what it means to be poor.        
The absence of a strong movement for change is striking, especially given the diversity Abramsky finds as he maps the landscape of poverty. “There are people with no high school education who are poor,” he writes, “but there are also university graduates on food bank lines. There are people who are poor because they have made bad choices, gotten addicted to drugs, burned bridges with friends and family — and then there are people who have never taken a drug in their lives, who have huge social networks, and who still can’t make ends meet.”        
The destitute include those “who have never held down a job, and others who hold down multiple, but always low-­paying, jobs, frequently for some of the most powerful corporations on earth.” There are the chronically poor — “children whose only hot meals are what they are given at school” — and the newly poor who have lost the middle-class comfort of “huge suburban houses and expensive cars.”        
Many of these people’s wounds are intimate and invisible to outsiders. Frank Nicci, a chef in Pennsylvania who lost his leg to diabetes and his job to his ill health, could not even afford to pick up his 8-year-old son for their monthly custodial visits. Lorenza and Jorge Caro, living in a storage room in New Mexico, regularly ran out of propane during the winter and relied on herbs and Tylenol for medical treatment. A 40-year-old mother in California, laid off from her job, had reached the lifetime limit for welfare and so was denied benefits after she had a new baby; she became homeless, and her older son had to quit college to support her. A Hawaii woman named Emily could never free herself from the legacy of a family racked by alcoholism and violence.        
“What should we do,” Abramsky asks, “with someone like Emily?” His answer is not to blame the victim, and he skewers conservatives for doing so. Whether poverty “is caused by dysfunction, or the dysfunction is itself a product of the poverty, or, as is likely, the dysfunction and the poverty interact in ever more complex feedback loops, for the larger community to wash its hands of the problem represents an extraordinary failure of the moral imagination.”

No open houses, no advertising and not a single online photo. And yet a $27 million town house on the Upper East Side and an $850,000 two-bedroom co-op in Lower Manhattan had no problem finding buyers in the past six months. Neither home was listed on the open market.        


Off-market deals, known as whisper listings, have long been the purview of the ultra-high-end market. Certain properties, often with price tags of $20 million or more, are shopped with a shroud of mystery among a small circle of well-connected agents instead of being put on the market for the world to see.        
Now this hush-hush approach has spread to many price points, including apartments below $1 million, as sellers realize the advantage they have, thanks to the lack of apartments available for sale in Manhattan.        
“Sellers feel cocky. Sellers feel like they have the ball,” said Brian K. Lewis, an associate broker at Halstead Property who in the last six months has taken on seven whisper listings from clients who do not want to list their apartments, but are willing to entertain offers. These range from a two-bedroom for $1.295 million on the Upper West Side to a downtown loft for $12 million. “In an improving economy with no inventory, they have the asset people want.”        
The number of apartments for sale in Manhattan at the end of August was at its lowest level in at least 13 years, according to Miller Samuel, the appraisal firm. The shortage has forced real estate agents to use aggressive tactics to drum up inventory, from trolling through expired listings in the hopes of reviving a dead deal to sending letters to owners in choice buildings to try to persuade them to sell.        
No one knows how many properties are sold through a well-placed word, but off-market tactics appear to be on the rise in major markets where there is a scarcity of inventory, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and Miami.        
“There’s more of it now than ever before,” said Shaun Osher, the chief executive of the brokerage firm CORE in New York, noting he has a database of about 50 apartments owned by people willing to sell given the right circumstances. “We as brokers know everything is always for sale at a price.”        
Plenty of circumstances arise in which it makes sense to keep a listing out of the limelight, ranging from celebrities who don’t want to read about their property transactions in the tabloids to sellers who would rather not upset tenants prematurely. Some sellers hope to avoid the hassle involved in getting a property in shape to show. Others don’t want a lot of people traipsing through.        
In March, for example, a five-bedroom town house at 12 East 76th Street on the Upper East Side sold for $27 million in a whisper sale without any wear and tear to the carpets. The place traded after just three viewings.        
Yet most brokerage firms are of two minds about off-market deals. On the buy-side, they are largely for it. After all, quietly gaining access to an off-market listing means less competition in a market where open houses often provoke a stampede. Uncovering a whisper sale — by say, chatting up the doorman — for a client unable to find something on the open market ultimately benefits that buyer.        
On the sell-side, brokerage firms tend to discourage whisper listings. For one, the secretive nature of whisper listings means some brokers will inevitably be shut out of a possible deal. Moreover, sellers hoping for a quick full-price sale through a whisper listing, they say, limit the buyer pool and thus, their chance of getting the highest possible price.        
“The seller is always going to be best served by making sure the property is exposed to the widest possible marketplace,” said Frederick Peters, the president of Warburg Realty.        
In addition, a whisper campaign can be a tall order. “It’s sort of like saying, achieve this great price and do all of this but don’t tell anybody about it,” said Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens.        
Finally, if discretion doesn’t move the merchandise, brokers can end up doing a lot of work for nothing.        
In a whisper campaign, the broker frequently has no signed contract with the seller, a scenario commonly referred to as a “pocket listing.” When there is a contract, it often mandates a quiet sale. If the broker finds a buyer, he or she often collects both sides of the commission.

The United Nations population division said this summer that fertility rates in many developing countries had not slowed as the U.N. had expected. As a result, it revised its forecast of the world population in 2100 upward by 700 million people, to 10.9 billion.        
Two years earlier, the U.N. had made an even larger revision, raising the forecast from 9 billion. And in its 2008 forecasts, global population was set to peak around 2070 and then begin to fall. In the latest forecast, there is no peak in sight.        
“What we have been finding, when we have looked at all of the data,” said Barney Cohen, the chief of the U.N.’s populations studies branch, “is that our previous projections were a little too optimistic. Fertility in Africa is not coming down as rapidly as we thought it would.”        
Africa accounts for nearly all the increased forecast for 2100 — about 600 million — and Latin America accounts for 100 million more. The U.N. forecasts for Europe and North America were reduced from previous ones.        
But it is possible that the U.N.’s latest forecast is too pessimistic. An analysis of population trends by Sanjeev Sanyal, the global strategist for Deutsche Bank, concludes that population growth is likely to be much slower than the U.N.’s estimate.        
“In our view, global fertility will fall to the replacement rate in less than 15 years,” Mr. Sanyal wrote. “Population may keep growing for a few more decades from rising longevity but, reproductively speaking, our species will no longer be expanding.” He forecasts that world population will peak in around 2055, at 8.7 billion, and decline to 8 billion by the end of the century.        
The fertility replacement rate — the number of children per woman needed to keep the population level over time — is usually considered to be 2.1. Mr. Sanyal says that in the developing world, it is higher, because of higher infant mortality and maternal death in childbirth. For the world as a whole, he thinks the current replacement rate is about 2.27, a figure that will come down gradually over time.        
The spread between the latest U.N. forecast and Deutsche Bank’s for 2100 — 2.8 billion people — is greater than the entire population of the world in 1955.        
“Developed countries have long had low birthrates, but the largest declines in fertility are in developing countries, with the Chinese, Russians, Koreans and Brazilians no longer reproducing themselves,” Mr. Sanyal wrote.        
Even if Mr. Sanyal turns out to be right, some developing countries seem likely to face explosive growth. In Nigeria, Mr. Sanyal says the fertility rate — the number of children born to an average woman during her life — is about six, more than four times than the rate in Japan. He thinks that rate will come down more rapidly than the U.N. expects, but still forecasts that the country will have 521 million people by the end of the century, an increase from about 160 million in 2010. The U.N. forecast is 914 million.        
The accompanying charts show the two forecasts for nine major countries. They agree in many ways. By the end of the century, both forecasts see population falling in China, India, Germany, Japan, Russia and Brazil. The bank thinks there will also be declines in the United States and France by then, while the U.N. forecast has both countries continuing to grow, albeit at declining rates. Both forecasts expect the British population to have leveled off.        
There is, of course, no way to be sure what will happen. A major epidemic could throw all forecasts off. Some developed countries have started campaigns to raise fertility, with only limited success so far.        
But a world with falling populations in many countries — and with the number of people of working age declining even more rapidly — could lead to major changes. Retirements are likely to occur later, and it is at least conceivable that some countries will even compete for immigrants. “Many countries are beginning to welcome skilled immigrants,” Mr. Sanyal said in an interview, adding that Germany was increasingly open to those whose skills were not as high.        
Mr. Sanyal is skeptical about one widespread forecast — that demand for health care will expand rapidly as populations grow. He says many of the older people are likely to be healthy, and notes that with fewer children, there will be less demand for health care from the young.

NEW YORK — If you don’t belong to a community these days, you’re really on your own.        


But never fear. “Community” has become one of those words that should always have quotation marks around it. Words get hijacked all the time, but this is one of those really violent, eight-country, stop-for-refueling hijackings.        
Actual communities in which people know each other, do things for each other and act in concert may be on the decline. But new meanings of community are rushing to fill the void.        
In U.S. government-speak, there’s the “intelligence community,” which every crisis reveals to be not much of a community at all. There’s a “scientific community,” but they quarrel over citations like toddlers. There’s the “European Community”; you know how that’s going. In Silicon Valley, there is a “developer community” of headphones-wearing techies who speak to no one and play video games alone. There’s a “business community,” whose members seek to put each other out of business. Entire races are called “communities,” however gaping their internal divisions. The religious, who always seem to be emerging from or heading into a schism, belong to the monolithic “faith community.”        
These new uses of “community” are about more than semantics. They offer clues to our present-day culture. They bespeak a world less tethered to place than before; uncomfortable with top-down leadership even if still dependent on it; saturated by business logic but determined to disguise the tawdriness of selling; obsessed with networking and also embarrassed by it.        
Go back a century or two (thanks to the Corpus of Historical American English database), and you see rather different usage of “community.” The word then seemed to connote a specific group of people, from a particular patch of earth, who knew and judged and kept an eye on one another, who shared habits and history and memories, and could at times be persuaded to act as a whole on behalf of a part.        
People wrote of “the community of my native city” and “the extensive community of Swallow Barn” and “the community of Friends in Barbadoes,” the lattermost referring to Quakers. “The citizens of Natchez are not a play-going community,” Jonathon Holt Ingraham wrote in a travelogue through the American South in 1835. “Philip Rochester stood well in the community,” Natalie Sumner Lincoln wrote in a 1920 novel. “A bad man is a plague spot in a community,” Professor Kenyon L. Butterfield wrote in a 1919 work on the future of farming.        
In cases where “community” was meant more abstractly, it was often in reference to the political community in a democracy — a group not known to each other but bound together in a solemn and real way. “The republican principle demands that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they entrust the management of their affairs,” Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 71 in 1788.        
Fast forward to today, and in some arenas this style of usage persists. But it competes now with a great many “communities” that aren’t really communities at all. What they are, though, is culturally telling.        
Place and shared experiences have fallen away from the modern understanding of “community.” When people speak of the “medical community” or the “venture capital community,” they’re really describing people with common interests and not common values, history or memory. Community in this sense is less about having one another’s back, more about lobbying for the same things.        
It’s also about networking and deal-making, under the cover of a word that makes such endeavors sound less crass. Almost every conference these days tells its attendees that it’s not really a conference but a community. PopTech is a “community of innovators.” The Feast is a “community of brilliant innovators.” South by Southwest features “the best new websites, video games and startup ideas the community has to offer.”

From time to time, Super Bowl advertisers have sponsored contests, among them brands like Chevrolet and Doritos. Now, for what may be the first time, the network broadcasting the Super Bowl is planning an ad contest of its own.        


The contest is scheduled to be announced Friday by the Fox Sports Media Group, which is part of 21st Century Fox; Fox Broadcasting will present Super Bowl XLVIII on Feb. 2, 2014. The tentative name for the contest is the Social Bowl, although there is already a Web site by that name that tracks the effectiveness of Super Bowl advertising in building value for brands.        
The contest is centered on an offer to give away a commercial on Super Bowl Sunday — not during the game, which is already about 95 percent sold, with only a “handful” of 30-second spots in the commercial inventory still available, Fox Sports Media Group executives say. Rather, the prize is a 30-second commercial to be broadcast at around 5 p.m. Eastern Time during the pregame show, valued at about $850,000. (The price tag on a 30-second commercial during the game is being estimated at $4 million.)        
Marketers will be able to participate in the contest by submitting proposed commercials to the Fox Sports Media Group and paying an entry fee of $150,000. Football fans, ad fans and anyone with access to social media will then vote on which potential spot they believe is Super Bowl Sunday-worthy after watching the entries on online platforms like the Fox Sports Web site or YouTube.        
The Fox Sports Media Group plans to promote the voting with an extensive campaign in social media outlets that is scheduled to begin on the first weekend in January. “We’ll be putting a ton of media behind it,” said Neil Mulcahy, executive vice president for sales at the Fox Sports Media Group, a ton being “a few million dollars.”        
A winner of the contest will be named close to or on game day; the executives have not decided yet on a date.        
“What this is, is a social experiment,” Mr. Mulcahy said, spurred by the fact that in the last few years the hoopla surrounding who is buying ads on Super Bowl Sunday has begun to build earlier and earlier.        
“It’s definitely a trend we’ve noticed,” he said, and it is being fed by the ability of advertisers to use social media like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and blogs to provide previews of their Super Bowl Sunday ads before Super Bowl Sunday.        
Pete Vlastelica, senior vice president for digital at the Fox Sports Media Group, estimated that for Super Bowl XLVII on Feb. 3, 2013, “thanks to the Internet, something like 40 percent of the in-game advertisers were teasing, leaking or running their whole spots” ahead of the game.        
Mr. Mulcahy credited Mr. Vlastelica with coming up with the idea for the contest. Mr. Vlastelica said he envisioned the contest as a way to “open to a much larger group of brands the opportunity to advertise on Super Bowl Sunday,” particularly the kinds of “independent, smaller brands that don’t think of participating in the run-up to the Super Bowl because it is beyond their reach.”        
There will be, however, nothing to prevent large marketers from submitting entries in the contest. “It will be interesting to see who wins,” Mr. Vlastelica said, “a major brand or a brand you’ve never heard of.”        
There will also be prizes in addition to the free commercial time, he added, in categories like funniest commercial or “most viral.”        
The commercials to be submitted in the contest must meet broadcast acceptability standards, Mr. Vlastelica and Mr. Mulcahy said, as well as the standards for advertising during National Football League games.        
In other words, Mr. Mulcahy said, laughing, “Keep it clean.”        
Mr. Mulcahy said he believed that the remaining commercial time in the game, five or so 30-second time slots, would be sold by mid-October. “The last time we had the Super Bowl, they were sold out by Thanksgiving,” he added.        
For Super Bowl XLVII seven months ago, which was broadcast by CBS, CBS executives announced about a month before the game was played that they had completed selling all the commercial time in the game.        
In another sign of how early the Super Bowl Sunday drum-banging now starts, several marketers have already announced that they plan to buy commercial time during Super Bowl XLVIII, including Anheuser-Busch, Chevrolet, Dannon Oikos yogurt, Hyundai Motor America and Intuit.        
The next Super Bowl may become known as the contest Super Bowl. In addition to the Fox Sports Media Group contest, the NFL Films unit of the National Football League introduced on Thursday night a contest called Together We Make Football — Your Story, centered on a microsite, or special Web site, togetherwemakefootball.com.        
The NFL Films contest asks, “Why do you love football?” and invites fans to submit, through Nov. 5, video clips of up to five minutes, or essays of up to 1,000 words, that answer the question. A panel is to select 10 finalists from among the entries, whose submissions will be turned into shorts by NFL Films and run during games played in December.        
Five winners from among the finalists will be selected by the public through votes on the microsite and announced during the playoffs. The winners will receive trips to the game and their stories will be featured in a documentary produced by NFL Films.

Some years ago the documentarian Alan Berliner was going to make a movie about a California woman with superabundant autobiographical memory. “She remembered everything in her past,” Mr. Berliner said. “The neurologists studied her at UC Irvine for five years, and she was the real deal. No tricks. Extraordinary.”        


The project didn’t work out, and Mr. Berliner sought solace in a familiar source.        
“I went to see Edwin,” he said, meaning his cousin, Edwin Honig, the renowned poet and translator, who was living in Providence, R.I., where he had taught at Brown University. “I told him I still wanted to do something about memory, and he said, ‘I’m worried about mine. Something’s happening.’ I said, ‘Can I bring a camera next time?’ ”        
The result, “First Cousin Once Removed,” which opened this month in theaters before showing on HBO on Monday, is unlike anything he’s done before, Mr. Berliner said, although, as usual, his subject remained in the family tree. With “Intimate Stranger” (1991), Mr. Berliner explored the baroque life of his maternal grandfather; “Nobody’s Business” (1996), was about his father; “The Sweetest Sound” was about the name Alan Berliner and various Alan Berliners. The popular “Wide Awake” (2006) was a wry meditation on Mr. Berliner’s battle with insomnia.        
“First Cousin” is many things at once: a family story, an Alzheimer’s travelogue and an example of nonfiction film as a vehicle for pure art. Mr. Honig, who died in 2011, may occupy the center of the movie, but the periphery is what its director chose to make it — a torrent of metaphor and imagery provoked, but not dictated, by the story of Mr. Honig’s departure from his past.        
Mr. Berliner’s own past surrounds him at his work space in downtown Manhattan. Stacked on metal shelves that line two walls of the studio are hundreds of color-coded film cans and boxes. Red denotes black-and-white 16-millimeter footage; orange, sound; yellow, 16-millimeter color; blue, his family’s home movies; green, others’ home movies; violet, found photographs from around the world; gray, slides and transparencies. “It’s spectral, you see,” Mr. Berliner said.        
Elsewhere along the shelves are subsections of emotional ephemera: discarded photo albums, love letters, suicide notes and journals, some found in flea markets, others in the trash. Cabinets are filled with wooden objects, pieces of carpet, flipbooks, toys, kaleidoscopes, zoetrope strips. Things for cutting. Things for pasting. Things for labeling. Things for measuring. A file cabinet is marked with the names of birds. Open a drawer, and the corresponding call rings out.        
Then there are the boxes and boxes of newspaper clippings, photos, program notes, reviews. “I’ve freaked filmmakers out who’ve come to visit,” he said. “If they once had a screening at the Collective for Living Cinema and it was reviewed in the SoHo News by Amy Taubin,” he added, referring to the defunct theater, the defunct publication and the veteran film critic, “I’ll give it to them and they’ll say, ‘I don’t even have that!’ ”        
Would he describe himself as obsessive? Pause. “Of course,” he said. “I’m not afraid of that word.”        
He’s not always so fearless. “My father lost his memory at the end, as did his father before him,” Mr. Berliner said. “As I often say, ‘Do the math.’ ”        
Mr. Honig was a cousin on his mother’s side. From that genealogical perspective, his studio suggests the interior view of one’s memories, preserved, one he drew on to create his cousin’s portrait.        
Five years in the making, “First Cousin,” features the poet in various stages of descent into a cruel and incurable disease.        
“It was a big decision not to make the film chronological,” Mr. Berliner said. “I intercut, and by doing that I could create ironies and more complex meanings. Alzheimer’s might be a progressive disease, but it’s not a linear disease; you could be more lucid three months from now than you are today.”        
Mr. Berliner received permission to make the film while Mr. Honig was still lucid, although he and his cinematographer, Ian Vollmer, both admitted to a certain uneasiness, inevitable given Mr. Honig’s deteriorating condition.        
“It was sometimes a wrenching thing to watch,” Mr. Vollmer said. “And it’s a disturbing film. When you’re in that condition, people would rather not look at you, they stop visiting, they don’t know how to handle it. It confronts them with the idea it may be them some day.”        
The film is troubling in other ways, too. As a child, Mr. Honig was blamed by his father for the death of his 3-year-old brother, who was hit by a truck, though Edwin was just 5 at the time. When he died, Mr. Honig was estranged from his second wife and two adoptive sons.        
“There’s a sense that, as we get to know more and more about Honig, all his great scholarship and creativity was really a shield against a world in which he was awfully unhappy,” said Richard Peña, who, as director of the New York Film Festival, programmed a 19-minute version of the film in 2010; the feature-length version had its debut at the festival last year. “The stuff with the sons is really heartbreaking, and some people were pretty angry about it, as they think it really tarnished his image.”        
Reviewers noted the misgivings but largely praised the project: “Watching Edwin stumbling among the ruins of comprehension and expression, sometimes in a fury of frustration, is a humbling and often harrowing experience,” the critic Neil Young wrote in The Hollywood Reporter. “But it’s a worthwhile one, as Berliner crafts a quietly touching and illuminating memento mori from the steady dying of an intellectual light.”        
Mr. Peña called Mr. Berliner “one of the great genre-confounders of our time.” He added: “I first knew of him as an experimental filmmaker, and now he’s often cited as one of our finest documentarists. Yet his style hasn’t really changed; I think he’s just forced us to reconsider all those definitions.”        
For his part, Mr. Berliner said he considered Mr. Honig an author of the film.        
“Edwin says things that evoke images and thought processes in me all the time,” the director said, still speaking of his cousin in present tense. “I showed him a green maraca he’d used to play with my son Eli, and said, ‘You remember playing with Eli?’ and he looks at me and says, ‘I have no night of what I knew in the morning.’ I could try all day and wouldn’t come up with something like that.”        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 29, 2013An article last Sunday about the filmmaker Alan Berliner and his new documentary, “First Cousin Once Removed,” about the decline and death of the poet and scholar Edwin Honig, misstated the running time for a shorter version of the film at the New York Film Festival and the year it was shown. It was a 19-minute version shown in 2010, not a 17-minute version in 2011.

Factory Floor 


FACTORY FLOOR        
“Factory Floor” (DFA), the self-titled debut album by an English electronic trio, is a present-day blast from an austere past. At the end of the 1970s, the combination of art-punk aesthetics, primitive electronic instruments, do-it-yourself budgets and a British recession spawned dance music that prided itself on using a few brittle, melody-defying sounds — the fewer the better — to get dance floors moving. Even then, the music had an abstinent spirit, proudly renouncing easy pleasures. Now that plush, rounded sounds and huge beats are available with a key click, it’s even more contrarian to build tracks from a handful of tinny sounds, unexaggerated percussion, bits of static, stray guitar sounds and deadpan vocals: “What is a good place to start?” goes the opening cut.        
Factory Floor, a trio since 2009 and a duo before that, established its post-punk bona fides by collaborating with industrial-rock pioneers, but it trades on rigor and rhythm, not nostalgia. With repetition and fractures, tiny noises amid stark silences, Factory Floor generates extraordinary propulsion in its dark, empty spaces.        
Sarah Jarosz 
BUILD ME UP FROM BONES        
Sarah Jarosz sings “Fuel the Fire,” a song on her third studio album, “Build Me Up From Bones” (Sugar Hill), with some of the breaks and sharpness of deep Appalachia; it’s a modal, irregular fiddle tune filled out by banjo and mandolin. But it’s hardly traditional. She’s singing about desire, as she does through much of the album. And partway through the song, it turns away from realistic acoustic recording to manipulate echoes and reverberation. Ms. Jarosz, 22, is expanding her beloved Americana roots in both sound and message. Her lyrics have a mystical streak, projecting love and loneliness across the landscape and the sky. And the string-band heritage matters to her, but so does what she can convey, here and now with her chosen instruments and modern technology, about “the way I feel inside.”        
Chvrches  
THE BONES OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE        
On the debut album by the Scottish band Chvrches, “The Bones of What You Believe” (Glassnote), the synthesizers gleam with artificial precision; so, at first, do the vocals, chopped into perfectly pitched samples over a majestic beat and swirling major chords. But then a human factor kicks in as Lauren Mayberry, the lead singer, warns: “We’ve come as far as we’re ever gonna get/Until you realize that you should go.” In the next song, “We Sink,” a perky dance beat carries her promise: “I’ll be a thorn in your side till you die.” Then comes “Gun,” hinting at domestic violence before she vows, “I will be a gun/And it’s you I’ll come for.” Chvrches get much of its sonic palette from trance: the shimmering timbres, the pealing arpeggios, the indefatigably smiley-faced beat. But “The Bones of What You Believe” turns trance’s reassurance inside out; it’s an album of breakup and near-breakup songs, in which love and longing are less likely to be a Utopia than a trap.        
Rokia Traoré 
BEAUTIFUL AFRICA        
The Malian singer Rokia Traoré has a gentle voice with a steely core, one that’s revealed more clearly than ever on “Beautiful Africa” (Nonesuch). The album was produced by John Parish, who does for Ms. Traoré what he’s done for P. J. Harvey and Eels: stripping away all unnecessary prettiness, focusing on a handful of instruments and a fully exposed voice, scratches and all. The album captures songs as they meditate, like “Mélancolie,” or spontaneously combust, like “Kouma,” about seduction and betrayal, and “Sikey,” about defying caste.        
Ms. Traoré, the well-traveled daughter of a diplomat, finely gauges her musical hybrids. Most of her songs have at their center a running dialogue between electric guitar and the Malian n’goni, a likely ancestor of the banjo. But when she gets to the title song of “Beautiful Africa” — a trilingual indictment of war across Africa, including Mali’s troubles — the wah-wah comes out and things get funky.        
Volcano Choir 
REPAVE        
Justin Vernon isn’t big on brand maintenance. After winning the Best New Artist Grammy Award as Bon Iver and collaborating with Kanye West under his own name, he has tucked himself back into the lineup of Volcano Choir, his continuing collaboration with the Milwaukee instrumental rock band Collections of Colonies of Bees. Volcano Choir’s debut album, “Unmap” in 2009, leaned toward the serene patterns of interlocking guitars that Collections often record on their own albums, with Mr. Vernon’s voice floating amid the ripples. The patterns are still there on Volcano Choir’s “Repave” (Jagjaguwar). But now Volcano Choir puts Mr. Vernon’s voice and words up front and builds something like songs around them, often with crescendos marching toward full-scale choruses — enough to make the often inscrutable lyrics sound passionate enough to be worth puzzling out.        
Sebadoh 
DEFEND YOURSELF        
Insecurity, guilt, confusion and doggedness — set to winsome melodies or gnarled guitar chords and run through battered equipment — were the makings of some of the best indie-rock of the early 1990s. On “Defend Yourself” (Joyful Noise), Sebadoh’s first studio album since 1999, Lou Barlow still has them all. The reason is set out in the album’s opening song, “I Will,” which sounds more sanguine than what its lyrics reveal. It’s about his leaving his wife (of 25 years) for a new love. For the rest of the album he wrestles with regrets, resentments and self-justifications. Sebadoh’s other songwriter, Jason Loewenstein, stands by his buddy, with punkier, more angular rockers: “Know that you’ve beaten yourself senseless/How do you feel now?” The guitars sound as raw as the emotions.        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 29, 2013A picture caption last Sunday with the Playlist column misidentified the band shown against a yellow background and also misidentified the photographer. The band is Factory Floor, with a debut album by the same name — not the Scottish band Chvrches, whose debut album is “The Bones of What You Believe.” And the picture was taken by Emilie Bailey, not by Bryan Zimmerman.

For the record, Cristin Milioti is not engaged. “No, I swear to you I’m telling the truth!” she nearly shrieked upon hearing a morsel of Internet gossip. “My boyfriend’s going to get such a kick out of that.” She grinned conspiratorially. “But we’re very happy,” she said of the man in question, the furniture maker Jesse Hooker.        


As an actor you know you’ve made it when the speculation begins. And Ms. Milioti, 28, is generating a high-pitched buzz as she prepares to step out with brown boots, yellow umbrella and electric bass on Monday night as the Mother on CBS’s “How I Met Your Mother” — a reveal eight seasons in the making.        
“I got really lucky this year,” she said, her enormous doe eyes winged in liner and her tiny body adorned in fitted black T-shirt, white high-tops and cutoffs ending a few inches above some “righteous tan lines.”        
What a year it has been. While performing the hits of Marketa Irglova and Glen Hansard as the Girl in the Broadway musical “Once,” she channeled the 1980s as Leonardo DiCaprio’s wife in Martin Scorsese’s “Wolf of Wall Street,” coming out in November. And in March, a day after leaving “Once,” for which she received a Tony nomination, she began filming as the Mother, who was introduced in the final moments of last season’s finale.        
In a recent interview the endearingly frank Ms. Milioti — a New Jersey native and Brooklyn resident who has played a Mafioso’s daughter on “The Sopranos” and a kittenish writer on “30 Rock,” and still has nightmares about her middle-school Eddie Munster phase — spoke with Kathryn Shattuck about her transition from the stage to the set. Here are excerpts from their conversation.        
Q. So, how did you land the role of the Mother? 
A. You know, it was a very roundabout way. There weren’t really auditions for it. There were, like, meetings. I met with [the show’s creators] Craig [Thomas] and Carter [Bays] over Skype, and I didn’t know what it was for. And then people started coming to see “Once.” It was so secretive that I was like, “O.K., I think I know what this is about.”        
I read that Neil Patrick Harris mistakenly congratulated you on the role while you were still testing. Had you met him at the Tonys? 
Maybe we met, but I don’t think we did, because you rehearse all morning, then you go to your matinee, then you do hair and makeup, then you do the red carpet, then you sit for four hours. And you never really have a meal. I imagine it’s like getting married or something. People are handing you tequila shots and Champagne. Suffice it to say I don’t remember much of the evening.        
The Mother is a bass player in a band. And in “Once” you played the piano and sang. How’d you come to have an arsenal of instruments? 
For “Once,” I learned the piano, essentially. For this, I’m attempting to learn bass. I mean, don’t ask me to play in front of anyone anytime soon. And I’ve always sung — way longer than I’ve acted. I just, like, couldn’t get a musical to save my life.        
Then you landed “Once.” 
I actually played a different role at a workshop in the beginning, and the only instrument I played was the sticks. John [Tiffany, the show’s director] really pushed for me to play this other role. We have a shorthand that is very special to me. We also can stay up and watch Beyoncé videos all night. She’s my bomb.        
Did Beyoncé ever see the show? 
One night I came out of my dressing room and there were Secret Service guys everywhere. And I got so excited. “Oh my God, Beyoncé is finally here!” And then it was Joe Biden — which was awesome, and he is so lovely. But Beyoncé never came. You know who did come and I lost my mind? Liza Minnelli, and I just died. She came out afterward and was like, “Oh my God, your energy.” I went completely silent.        
And now you’ve got a role in a Scorsese film. 
It’s a very fun role and I’m unrecognizable. I have a huge perm, acrylic tips, I’m spray-tanned and have a thick Queens accent. It’s a big role. Or at least I think it is. I constantly live in fear that I will show up to see it and they will have replaced me with Don Cheadle.

The set, inside the cavernous studio on Chelsea Piers in Manhattan, is meant to represent the bunkerlike headquarters of a polished Chinese techno-gangster who has a relationship with the criminal mastermind Raymond Reddington, now — for murky reasons unknown to both the gangster and the audience — aligned with the F.B.I.        


Reddington, the main character in the coming and much-anticipated new NBC drama “The Blacklist,” is, at this moment, wearing a light-green short-sleeved shirt and brown walking shorts. He looks more like a U.P.S. delivery man than the scourge of American law enforcement. Then again, it’s only rehearsal, and James Spader has his Reddington intensity dialed down to zero, in favor of his normal, real-life mode of free-associating bonhomie.        
That is the quality that comes through in his enthusiasm for this new starring role: “The possibilities of this show are limitless,” he says, excitement pitched in his voice. “Anybody can be on the blacklist. Ha, ha, ha! Anybody!”        
No new network drama enters the season with higher expectations — or more pressure — than “The Blacklist.” The show has won wide praise from critics and was the most talked about show during the last development season in Hollywood. And, to be blunt, NBC needs a hit. The network has slotted it in the best spot on its schedule, Mondays at 10 p.m., after its top-rated show, “The Voice.” A lot is riding on this series and Mr. Spader’s eye-catching performance.        
A few minutes after rehearsal, in a gray herringbone suit and vest, hair skimmed close to his scalp, Mr. Spader is in full Reddington mode, jousting with his Chinese nemesis with weary disdain, delivering lines of complicated dialogue with precision — through 12 long takes.        
One reason for all the repetition: Mr. Spader’s new co-star, Megan Boone, who plays Reddington’s foil in the series, a young F.B.I. agent named Liz Keen, is not as sure-footed in the scene. Of course, Ms. Boone, perhaps best known for the short-lived “Law & Order: Los Angeles,” hasn’t been acting in movies, television and theater for 35 years as Mr. Spader has.        
“Would you say Spader is kind of an enigma?” Ms. Boone muses later in her dressing room. “He’s very unexpected. He’s very kind and considerate. But then you also don’t ever feel 100 percent comfortable.”        
All of which makes James Spader the ideal choice for Reddington, a character intended to fascinate and mystify. In the opening episode, to be shown on Monday night, Reddington gives himself up to the F.B.I., offering to help capture a host of known and unknown supercriminals — on just one condition: that he work with Liz Keen, a woman he seemingly has had no prior connection to. Even Mr. Spader doesn’t want to know too much about the reasons for all that.        
“As long as the show continues to be enigmatic, it has its compulsion,” Mr. Spader said. “I need to know a little bit more than the viewer, but I don’t want to know more than that.”        
Jon Bokenkamp, one of the executive producers of “The Blacklist,” said that in conversations with another producer, John Fox, they pictured a Keyser Soze, the mysterious villain of the film “The Usual Suspects.” Mr. Bokenkamp pointed out that Reddington tells the F.B.I.: “Don’t trust me. Everything about me is a lie.”        
The script for the “Blacklist” was, Mr. Spader says, intriguing in ways that got his attention. “It was to be shot in New York,” he noted, which he considers home. And then there was that character. There is, he said, his eyes widening with delight, “a lot of room for me to move around in there.”        
Mr. Spader has always been an actor who looks to expand boundaries. His career has ranged from memorable teenagers (“Pretty in Pink”) to provocative bad boys (“Sex, Lies and Videotape”) to acclaimed television lawyers. He won three Emmy Awards for playing the character Alan Shore in two series, “The Practice” and “Boston Legal.” Along the way he acquired a reputation for quirky, idiosyncratic performances of eccentric characters.        
Now 53 and no longer in possession of the wavy locks that were his early signature, Mr. Spader remains in demand for more mature quirky, idiosyncratic performances.        
Coming off “Boston Legal,” Mr. Spader was at loose ends — and broke, he said, because he spent all his television money “on new households, families, new lives and all that.” Movies held little appeal, either in roles or compensation. Then David Mamet approached him about his play “Race,” slated for a Broadway run.        
Mr. Spader said yes: “Not a perfect play but a great role for me.”

The next generation of a prominent New York real estate family business, Glenwood Management, has taken up the mantle at the company and begun its first condominium project.        


Glenwood is one of the city’s largest private landlords and has a long history of building and managing rental apartments, but Howard and Steven Swarzman, the grandsons of Leonard Litwin, the founder of Glenwood, made the decision to take on the condo project at 60 East 86th Street.        
“This came about because my brother, Steven, and I wanted to try this model as opposed to what we’ve developed in the past,” said Howard Swarzman, acknowledging that his grandfather has a “philosophy” of building high-quality rental housing. “But what we’re most concerned with is building the same quality housing we’ve always done,” he said, “whether it be for sale or rental.”        
Along with the Swarzmans, Mr. Litwin is a sponsor of the project, as are several Glenwood executives. While other Manhattan property developers have been flocking to the ultra-high-end condo market where apartments have recently gone into contract for as much as $90 million apiece, Mr. Swarzman said that wasn’t a motivating factor for the Glenwood team.        
The project, called Sixty East Eighty Sixth, a 19-story building that will be built just east of Madison Avenue with 15 full-floor three- or four-bedroom units, will be priced at about $7 million to $20 million an apartment, according to Beth Fisher, a senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which will be marketing the units.        
The Glenwood team, Mr. Swarzman said, has begun demolition of two existing buildings on East 86th: a 30-foot-wide town house and an adjacent walk-up building, both bought in March for a total of roughly $31 million. The condo tower should be completed by the spring of 2015, he added.        
A small building site and Manhattan’s exorbitant land prices made it impossible to do the sort of rental building with dozens of units that Glenwood typically constructs, even with rents at record levels, Mr. Swarzman said. Sixty East Eighty Sixth will only be about 60,000 square feet, he said; rental buildings are typically around 300,000 square feet.        
Clad in fluted limestone with casement windows and Juliet balconies, Sixty East Eighty Sixth is being designed by a collaboration of the Steven B. Jacobs Group, a previous Glenwood partner, and the Danish architect Thomas Juul-Hansen, a Richard Meier protégée who designed the interiors for pricey Manhattan projects like the Perry Street Residence and One57, a tower under construction on West 57th Street.        
Besides the 12 single-floor units, the project will have three marquee residences: a duplex penthouse with a rooftop and side terrace; a 10th-floor duplex with two terraces; and a ground-floor triplex with a 36-foot-by-30-foot rear garden. Prices will range from $12 million to $20 million.        
The building’s amenities will be on the basement level, including a fitness room, individual storage rooms, a bicycle storage room, a children’s playroom and a wine cellar. The lobby will have a sitting area, a small library and a 24-hour doorman.        
Mr. Juul-Hansen, who tends to favor classic materials, clean lines and minimal furnishings, said his goal at 60 East 86th Street was bridging the contemporary with the traditional.        
“Obviously, this is not downtown, and it’s not the High Line or any other neighborhood that’s sort of up and coming,” he said. “There’s a history here, so what we’ve tried to do is create a building that, on the one hand, is very modern, clean and simple, but on the other hand, is very respectful of the neighborhood and environment.”        
Elevators will open into the full-floor units, arriving at a foyer that separates a private wing with bedrooms and bathrooms from the public rooms. The living rooms and dining areas will be open and spacious with ceiling heights of about 10 feet, or nearly 20 feet in the duplexes and the triplex.        
Floors will be wide-plank oak, except in the kitchens, where they will be Vals quartzite. Mr. Juul-Hansen said that while the building will have large windows, the structure will be a far cry from a contemporary glass tower. “We have beautiful windows, but they’re not just flat pieces of glass,” he said. “They have true divided panes that will add texture to the facade.”        
Only steps away from Central Park, the large residences are designed to have broad appeal, Ms. Fisher said, but may attract families in particular, perhaps those already living on the Upper East Side but looking for newer construction. Ms. Fisher said she could not yet reveal exact pricing for the apartments, but added, “I think the market throughout the city has come to accept that $3,000 per square foot is a baseline number for a luxury condominium on the market. Certainly on the Upper East Side right near Central Park.”

The pianist and composer Muhal Richard Abrams, who just turned 83, has always had roughly equal use for communion and solitude. Nearly 50 years ago he laid the groundwork for the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, one of the great collectivist institutions in African-American music. And yet his own creative metabolism suggests a rugged self-containment, impervious to outside influence.        


So there’s more than a casual symmetry in the format for his concert on Thursday in Brooklyn at Roulette, which kicks off the 25th season of Interpretations, the new-music series run by Thomas Buckner. Mr. Abrams will perform the first half alone at the piano, most likely as a long-form improvisation. The second half will feature an ensemble with two other pianists, Amina Claudine Myers and Joseph Kubera; four vocalists, including Mr. Buckner, a baritone; and a chamberlike cohort of violin, cello, clarinet, electronics and percussion. The program’s title is “Dialogue Social,” a phrase that fits. (8 p.m., Thursday, 509 Atlantic Avenue, at Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, 917-267-0363, roulette.org; $15, $10 for students.)

It is 10 years since Fall for Dance burst upon the New York fall season with its eclectic programs, its international mix of the well-known and the undiscovered and — most important — its movie-ticket prices. That price has sneaked up, to $15 from $10, but it’s still a steal for the caliber of work you can see at any of the five programs.        


The opening lineup, on Wednesday and Thursday nights, is particularly good, starting with the Richard Alston Dance Company, from England, performing Mr. Alston’s “Devil in the Detail,” to music by Scott Joplin. It’s a chance to become better acquainted with the fluid, musical work of Mr. Alston, who is one of Britain’s foremost choreographers but is still not as well known here as he should be.        
Also on Program 1 are the superb tango artists Gabriel Missé and Analía Centurión; the vibrant group Dance Brazil; and a new pas de deux by Justin Peck, the man of the moment, for the New York City Ballet principal Sara Mearns and the Dutch National Ballet principal Casey Herd.        
A warning: tickets for the festival sell out faster than you can say jeté. Don’t wait. (8 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday through Oct. 5; City Center, 131 West 55th Street, 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org.; $15.)

Some former child stars have stayed in the spotlight by being arrested or doing vulgar dances on national awards shows. Kirk Cameron has done it with his religious beliefs. Mr. Cameron, who played Mike Seaver on the sitcom “Growing Pains” in the 1980s and early ’90s, is an outspoken conservative Christian who has angered some with his views, particularly comments last year about homosexuality, which he called “detrimental and ultimately destructive to so many of the foundations of civilization.”         
But Mr. Cameron wants to be more than a mere lightning rod. On Tuesday his “Unstoppable” is booked for a one-night showing in almost 700 theaters. He describes the film as a documentary that embodies his search for answers to some of the most difficult questions faced by any religion, like why a benevolent God would let bad things happen to good people. “It’s real easy to get excited about our faith when things are going well,” he told The Christian Post. “When we’re happy, healthy, we have a job, money to put gas in the car, and our checkup at the doctor’s office is all clear. But when tragedy hits and your whole world comes crashing down, that’s when the questions really start.”

Who are the musicians who define New York? For the last four decades, one of the most indefatigable has been John Zorn, the composer, saxophonist, impresario and all-around macher of the city’s arts scene. He has founded a record label (Tzadik) and a performing space (the Stone, in the East Village). Perhaps most impressive, he has managed to retain an edge of enfant-terrible cred while making the transition from downtown stalwart to uptown respectability. Institutions all over the city are honoring Mr. Zorn, who turned 60 on Sept. 2.        


This week the Miller Theater at Columbia University hosts a three-concert celebration of his prodigious, wide-ranging compositional output. The first, on Wednesday, focuses on Mr. Zorn’s orchestral writing, including his 1999 violin concerto “Contes de Fées” and the American premiere of “Suppôts et Supplications.” His chamber music is featured on Thursday with a handful of world premieres, and Friday brings a rich helping of his improvisatory Game Pieces from the 1970s and ’80s.

“Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926-1938,” opening on Saturday at the Museum of Modern Art, is sure to be a crowd-pleaser: among its 80 works are well-known canvases like “The Treachery of Images” (better known for its declaration, “This is not a pipe”) and “The Lovers,” with its eerie image of a kiss stymied by drapery.        


But even as it serves up some of Surrealism’s greatest hits, this touring show (which will travel to the Menil Collection in Houston and the Art Institute of Chicago) will also try to get into Magritte’s head — to figure out how he made paintings that are so obvious in their flat and collagelike construction, so familiar in their imagery of landscapes, nudes and bowler hats, and yet so profoundly unsettling. Tactics like doubling, mirroring and mislabeling objects will be studied closely, as will the social and professional relationships Magritte formed in Paris and Brussels. And Surrealist objects, photographs and early commercial work will be shown alongside the show’s many paintings and collages. Viewers who wish to peek beneath the bowler hat, in other words, will have many chances to do so. (Through Jan. 12, 212-708-9400, moma.org.)

What do men want? According to Esquire magazine — for eight decades a hot line to the male psyche — they want their own cable network that caters to a more sophisticated but no less masculine viewer than those currently in thrall to tattoo parlors, pawnshops and hillbillies. So now they’ve got it. “You only live once,” a male voice intones in ads for the Esquire Network, which makes its debut Monday on what was Style. “But if you really live, once is all you need.”        


On the list of life’s apparent necessities: “Knife Fight,” rowdy after-hours cooking bouts refereed by the chef Ilan Hall; “Brew Dogs,” starring the Scottish malt rebels James Watt and Martin Dickie; “The Getaway,” an Anthony Bourdain creation in which celebrities make like locals in exotic ports of call; and “Boundless,” which bumps along with the extreme sportsmen Simon Donato and Paul Trebilcock. But first the magazine will do what any self-respecting chap might and toast its “80 years of legends, heroes and heartbreakers.” Because, as that voice says, “The man who’s lived a well-played life never has to lie about his age.”

By her own definition, 19-year-old Hou Yifan is an average student. She is a sophomore at Peking University, one of China’s top colleges, and says she constantly falls behind on her work.        


But she has a better excuse than most: Ms. Hou is one of the greatest chess prodigies in history. She has been ranked among the top 10 women in the world since she was 12 and became a grandmaster, the game’s top title, when she was 14 years old — the 15th youngest on record.        
On Friday, while most of her fellow students were in class, Ms. Hou was routing Anna Ushenina of Ukraine in the last game of their Women’s World Chess Championship match in Taizhou, China.        
Ms. Hou won the match 5.5 to 1.5 to recapture the crown, which she lost last year in the early rounds of a championship tournament. Ms. Ushenina, who is now 28, won the tournament, and the title. Ms. Hou first won the crown in 2010 when she was 16, making her the youngest player, man or woman, to win a world title. She successfully defended the title in 2011.        
This year, Ms. Hou was the heavy favorite. She went into the match ranked as the No. 2 female player in the world; Ms. Ushenina’s ranking was No. 17.        
For her victory, Ms. Hou earned the equivalent of about $160,000, while Ms. Ushenina received the equivalent of about $106,000.        
In a telephone interview in English an hour after the last game Friday, Ms. Hou said the match “wasn’t so easy, but it also was not so difficult.” Because of her schedule at the university and because she had recently played in another tournament, she said, she had had little time to prepare.        
Born in Xinghua, China, Ms. Hou discovered the game when she was 3 and her father took her to a store where she saw a glass chess set in a window and began staring at it. Her father bought a set, and she soon began beating him, so he found her a chess tutor. By 2003, at age 9, she was a member of the Chinese national team.        
Describing herself Friday as a full-time student, Ms. Hou said she did not receive any “special privileges” that allowed her to avoid fulfilling her course requirements. She also has to be in class most of the time, although she is allowed to leave for tournaments. Her travel schedule — she was recently in Norway and will soon go to Greece — is making her studies difficult, but she said she took her books with her.        
Ms. Hou is well known in China, so when she enrolled last year at the university, some of the other students were “a bit surprised,” she said. But she said her fellow students had gotten used to having her there.        
Asked why she was in the university at all, she said, “I am trying to really learn something” other than chess.        
Now that the championship is over, she is going back to school before she competes in the European Club Cup next month. Before leaving, she has to cram for exams.

BIRMINGHAM, Mich. — Even at 88, and in what might be called spectacularly frail health, Elaine Stritch can still make a theatrical entrance.        


Dinner is ready, in the condominium just next door to the one Ms. Stritch herself moved into last spring in this pristine Detroit suburb, near where she grew up and where much of her family resides.        
The crab cakes have been baked, the corn on the cob boiled, the spinach steamed, the cocktails stirred. Still, no sign of Ms. Stritch.        
The minutes tick by, with a small frisson of anxiety building. The dinner’s hosts, Kim and Henry Hagood, who have become Ms. Stritch’s friends since she moved next door, can’t seem to get a response, either to a phone call or a knock on the door. We all know she’s not been well lately.        
Then, with little fanfare, there she is, a beaming smile on her face, a barking command to her caretaker on her lips. She is dressed with her usual, ahem, minimalism, in black tights, a Detroit Athletic Club T-shirt and not much else. Except for one new and unhappy accessory: a wheelchair.        
Ms. Stritch would doubtless prefer a modest string of pearls, but the last several months have not been kind. Before making her dramatic exit from New York — to theater lovers for whom Ms. Stritch is an ornery goddess, it was as if the Chrysler Building itself had picked up its skirts and skipped off to Detroit, of all preposterous places — Ms. Stritch took a bad fall one morning while leaving her longtime habitat, the Carlyle Hotel. Eye surgeries followed.        
Not long after that, Ms. Stritch took a second tumble, breaking a hip. Recovery was under way, and Ms. Stritch was settling down in Birmingham when she leaned over to brush her teeth one night at the bathroom sink, somehow lost her balance, and hit the deck again, fracturing her pelvis. So for at least another month or six weeks, she won’t be up and about, although for someone used to striding about with a commanding gait in those tights and heels, she seems to be taking her tumble into infirmity with some measure of acceptance.        
When asked what she’s been doing to keep herself occupied, the answer comes quickly: sleeping, often until 3 or 4 in the afternoon — late, even by the standards of showbiz folk. But she seems to relish this: “I’ve been preparing for this nap for a long time,” she says.        
Black humor has always come naturally to Ms. Stritch, whose long career, on the New York and London stage, and, more recently, on the television series “30 Rock,” has made her a well-armored survivor. Asked how she has been adjusting to her new life away from the spotlight, Ms. Stritch says, “I don’t really know, I’ve been too busy falling down.        
“It’s like a comedy,” she adds, “only a not so funny one.”        
Shortly after arriving in Birmingham, Ms. Stritch gave an interview to the Vanity Fair Web site, in which she seemed grousy and regretful. Grousing has always come naturally to this scaldingly frank woman, but she’s never made much of a song and dance about woulda, coulda, shoulda.        
“I’m thinking maybe I left a little early,” grumbled the woman once notorious for being the last to abandon any party. The gods apparently can’t take a joke, because for now, at least, even strolling next door is out of the picture for Ms. Stritch. And yet, perhaps because she’s been forced to settle down, her attitude toward her sudden bolt from the spotlight seems to be mellowing.        
“One thing I’m proud of myself for doing is combating those feelings,” she says, when those professed second thoughts are mentioned. “I don’t want to be a sad sack who made a mistake. I gotta have a home, a base, a place where all my shoes are. I’m settled. When I first moved in here, I had good friends around me, but I kept thinking, ‘I can’t imagine being here alone.’ But then I was alone, and everything was fine. Now I’d kill to be alone,” she adds, referring to the full-time caretaking she now requires.        
“I’ve come up against tougher things than this,” she adds. “I want to win at this decision.”        
If that still doesn’t sound like a ringing affirmation of her happiness, so be it. Putting up a veneer of good cheer has never been Ms. Stritch’s stock in trade. Putting it all out there is much more her style, and in conversations over dinner and in her kitchen the following day, Ms. Stritch remains the same blunt, acerbic, unedited personality she always has been, even if the pain killers she takes sometimes find her beginning a story, only to lose its thread (“I guess I just won’t be giving you that jewel,” she says grimly), or asserting an opinion only to proffer another view a few minutes later.

A dozen long-vanished films again see the light of day in the new DVD anthology from the National Film Preservation Foundation, “Lost and Found: American Treasures From the New Zealand Film Archive.” A few have big names attached to them — John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, Mabel Normand — but every movie here has its own fascination, some for social and historical reasons, others as entertainment pure and simple.         
They are a varied lot, ranging in date from 1914 to 1929, and in length from under a minute to full-scale features. What these films do have in common is that, as recently as four years ago, no one outside the small circle of film collectors who had originally acquired them knew they existed. They all belonged to the legions of missing and presumed lost movies of the silent era, a category that includes at least three-quarters of all silent features, and even higher for short films.        
It always seems a bit miraculous when lost films resurface; for so many to turn up at once in the same place is a phenomenon of biblical proportions. These films, along with many more (176 in all) that are still in the cataloging and preservation pipeline, were quietly residing in the New Zealand Film Archive when Brian Meacham, an archivist for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, dropped by its Wellington headquarters during a vacation. He was confronted with a trove of nitrate prints of non-New Zealand titles that the young institution had yet to preserve (understandably, the New Zealanders were focused on their own national cinema).        
Mr. Meacham soon discovered that the collection contained a large number of American movies held by no other archive, thanks to a quirk of early film distribution. Where films are normally returned to the studios that made them once their commercial life is over, it was considered too expensive to ship used prints back to the United States after they’d finished their antipodal careers (Australia is also proving to be a good hunting ground for lost American movies). Abandoned by their owners, many films fell into the hands of collectors, whose libraries were eventually deposited with the national archive.        
The New Zealand find made headlines when it was announced in 2010. Responsibility for repatriating the American films was assumed by the National Film Preservation Foundation, the nonprofit, charitable affiliate of the Library of Congress’s National Film Preservation Board. (I am a member of the board, and have served on grant panels for the foundation, though none related to this project.) With support from several public and private institutions, including the Hollywood studios that retained copyright to some of the titles, the films are being preserved by the foundation’s five archival partners: the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences; George Eastman House; the Library of Congress; the Museum of Modern Art; and the University of California, Los Angeles, Film & Television Archive.        
The present disc presents highlights from the first group of films to be reclaimed, while the project continues; more are available for streaming at the foundation’s Web site: filmpreservation.org. Others will be added as they become available.        
Although the films on the DVD come from different eras of film exhibition — embracing the evolution from storefront nickelodeons with their programs of one- and two-reel narratives to the movie palaces of the 1920s, with their full-length features and live orchestras — the types here suggest the breadth of a typical evening at the movies during the silent era.        
The program opens with a travelogue, though one of an unusual sort: “Lyman H. Howe’s Famous Ride on a Runaway Train,” the 1921 version of a concept that Howe, a traveling showman who worked the Northeast, filmed several times. The picture is a pure thrill ride, with the camera attached to the front of a train hurtling around hairpin turns and down steep mountainsides, creating the same exhilaratingly vertiginous effect that the makers of “This Is Cinerama” would replicate with a roller coaster in 1952 (and which digital 3-D continues to exploit today).        
Animated cartoons, which had become a staple of the program by 1914, are represented by Paul Terry’s 1923 “Happy-Go-Luckies,” featuring the overlooked team of Henry Cat and Fido Dog. The educational component is provided by a sponsored film, “Birth of a Hat: The Art and Mystery of Making Fur Felt Hats,” produced around 1920 by the John B. Stetson Company. “The Love Charm” (1928) is a one-reel novelty produced to show off an improvement in the two-color process then being developed by the Technicolor corporation.        
Serials came into existence in the early teens as producers began to struggle with the storytelling limitations of one- and two-reel narratives. “The Chinese Fan” is Chapter 5 of “The Active Life of Dolly of the Dailies,” a 1914 Edison serial centered, like many of the first chapter plays, on a fearless young woman, in this case a reporter played by Mary Fuller. From the same year, “Won in a Cupboard” is a Keystone comedy starring, directed and most likely written by the no-less-fearless Mabel Normand, all of 21 at the time.        
A short trailer for John Ford’s lost “Strong Boy,” from 1929, introduces the disc’s centerpiece, a tinted print of Ford’s five-reel feature of 1927, “Upstream.”

TRYING to glean differences among the generations makes for an interesting parlor game. But this week, three reports by big financial institutions offered insights into how investors in their 40s and 20s — known as Generation X and Generation Y — think about their personal finances in the broadest way.        


The reports by Fidelity, U.S. Trust and Pershing show how the younger generations want to set themselves apart from the baby boomers. The reports yielded tips from which any generation could benefit but also contained some red flags indicating where the younger generations could stumble in the future from the same traits that seem like strengths today.        
“When I was 25 years old, I wanted to emulate my parents,” said Craig D. Pfeiffer, a former vice chairman of Morgan Stanley and the founder and chief executive of Advisors Ahead, which trains advisers to work with younger clients. “I can remember proudly telling my father that I opened an account at a national financial services firm. When we wanted to buy our first home, we sought out our parents’ real estate agent. Today there is great pride in saying ‘I don’t have an account where you have one, and I’m proud that I’m not doing what you did.’ ”        
That’s all well and good — and youthful rebellion is to be expected — but the decisions chronicled in these reports will affect the financial success of these generations for years. While some choices seem to be positive, others are going to take more time to play out. Here’s a look at some of the more interesting findings.        
HAVING A SAY Fidelity’s Millionaire Outlook found that Gen X and Gen Y were deeply engaged in managing their money, though that engagement was not necessarily paired with a deep knowledge of investing.        
The report said that nearly three-quarters of the young millionaires surveyed said they felt knowledgeable about investing, found it enjoyable and were actively involved in it. Yet that group also reported making 30 trades a month on average, meaning they may be less aware of fees and the risks of short-term speculation.        
“Thirty a month is a big number,” said Bob Oros, executive vice president of Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services. “But I would look at it less as an absolute number. They’re actively engaged in how their assets are managed.”        
Mr. Pfeiffer, who participated in the introduction of the Pershing report on the need to bring younger financial advisers into the advisory business, equated the heightened interest to the do-it-yourself movement in home repair. “They go to Home Depot and Lowe’s and try to fix it themselves,” he said. “Then they call the plumber to fix what they did. There is absolutely great risk around do-it-yourself.”        
Rahul Shah, a founder of Peninsula Wealth in San Francisco said his clients broke down along generational lines and by wealth level. He said that Facebook employees with wealth exceeding $20 million had found advisers to help them manage the complexity, while those with a couple of million dollars were trying to figure it out themselves.        
“There are a few who say, ‘Is there an app for this that can do this for me?’ ” he said. “Whether there is an app for that or not, everyone is going to behave emotionally when they’re managing their own money.” He said he would manage his client’s money better than his father’s money because he had an emotional attachment to his father’s money.        
He added that many Google millionaires discovered this the hard way in 2008, when the financial markets collapsed four years after the company’s public offering.        
SEEKING VALIDATION When Gen X and Gen Y investors ask for help, they want an adviser to collaborate with them and, in some cases, validate their decisions. The Fidelity report found that nearly all millionaires in this cohort worked with advisers — compared with just two-thirds of millionaire baby boomers — but that six in 10 said they used their adviser for a second opinion on investment decisions.

When it comes to ratatouille, there is no shortage of recipes. There’s the traditional, time-consuming kind in which you sauté all the vegetables separately, then stew them together slowly in a casserole. There’s the shortcut method of simmering everything at once. There’s roasted ratatouille, microwaved ratatouille and even steamed ratatouille, though that one doesn’t tempt me at all.        


Finally, there’s grilled ratatouille, a recipe with many charms both in the method and the result. Grilling takes the whole process outside, allowing you to enjoy the last handful of temperate nights. The grill also adds a lovely smoky nuance to the finished dish without overpowering the essential flavors of vegetables, olive oil and herbs. And grilled ratatouille is relatively fast to make — maybe not as quick as using the microwave, but tastier.        
All of this said, grilling vegetables for a ratatouille does take some finesse. The first time I tried, I did everything wrong. I built a very hot, very high fire; coated the peppers, zucchini and eggplant in olive oil; then plopped them onto the grill, only to watch my poor vegetables blaze up and burn.        
So the next time, I took things more slowly. I built a less-intense fire and spread out the coals more evenly. I left off the oil, at least while the vegetables cooked. Then I hung around them, sipping wine and keeping an eye on their various states of doneness, pulling off each piece as soon as it was charred in spots and very tender. No one wants al dente ratatouille.        
Once everything was thoroughly cooked and slightly cooled, I chopped up the vegetables and doused them in olive oil, which is as essential to good ratatouille as the eggplants and peppers. I also stirred in copious amounts of basil and garlic.        
What I got was something less stew-y and more salad-like than a typical ratatouille, but with a concentrated flavor and velvety texture, along with a garlicky kick.        
I served it with herbed goat cheese and crisp toast while it was still warm, then ate the cold leftovers the next day with a dollop of yogurt and a sprinkle of chile powder. Like the original, it will keep for many days in the fridge, getting better as it sits.        
Grilled ratatouille may not replace the other ratatouille variations in your repertory. But it’s a nice, deeply flavored addition to the list.

WHISTLE-BLOWERS have been big news lately — from Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Pfc. Bradley Manning, to Edward J. Snowden. Yet, for most people, the question of whether to expose unethical or illegal activities at work doesn’t make headlines or involve state secrets.        


But that doesn’t make the problem less of a quandary. The question of when to remain quiet and when to speak out — and how to do it — can be extraordinarily difficult no matter what the situation.        
And while many think of ethics violations as confined to obviously illegal acts, like financial fraud or safety violations, the line often can be much blurrier and, therefore, more difficult to navigate.        
According to the Ethics Resource Center, a nonprofit research organization, the No. 1 misconduct observed — by a third of 4,800 respondents — was misuse of company time. That was closely followed by abusive behavior and lying to employees.        
The findings were published in the organization’s 2011 National Business Ethics Survey, which interviewed, on the phone or online, employees in the commercial sector who were employed at least 20 hours a week. It has been conducted biannually since 1994.        
But offensive behavior that creates a hostile work environment, although often not thought of as unethical behavior, is the leading reason people leave their jobs, said Patricia J. Harned, president of the center. “Abusive and intimidating behavior by supervisors and managers creates a toxic work environment.”        
So does lying to employees. Lester, who asked that I use only his first name to avoid possible legal issues, worked at a global consulting company for about three years, earning high performance ratings. At one point, he said, he accidentally learned that his manager had deliberately lied to deny him a promotion opportunity. Lester spoke to the hiring manager to no avail, and because the company had a strong ethics program — including a specific “no retaliation policy” and a hot line to report ethics complaints — he reported the situation.        
An investigation found no wrongdoing, and although Lester appealed the findings, no action was taken against the manager. That is when he says the retaliation began.        
“All my direct reports were taken away from me and I was given the most difficult projects with the least resources,” he said. “A whole series of things happened, which were unlikely to be a coincidence.”        
After about eight months of this, he decided to leave.        
Lester’s experience may be the reason the misconduct most often seen is not the one most often reported. According to the Ethics Resources Center report, which is sponsored by major corporations like Wal-Mart and Northrop Grumman, less than half of those who observed a boss lying to employees reported it.        
On the other hand, while only 12 percent said they had witnessed someone stealing from the company, almost 70 percent of those who saw such activity reported it.        
One of the difficulties in cases like Lester’s is that no law has been broken. True whistle-blowing, according to Stephen M. Kohn, a lawyer and executive director of the National Whistleblowers Center, is when people report seeing or experiencing something at their company that is against the law, rather than cases in which employees feel mistreated, but nothing illegal has occurred.        
It appears, however, that an increasing number of employees are willing to come forward in both types of cases. More people are using their companies’ ethics procedures to report misconduct, and more people are filing whistle-blower claims.        
Mr. Kohn, whose organization refers potential whistle-blowers to lawyers, said there had been a 30 percent increase in the number of people requesting referrals over the last 18 months, which comes to about 1,500 requests a year.        
He also said the quality of complaints — with more documentation and from higher-level employees — had increased.        
Some of this is because of legislation rewarding whistle-blowers for coming forth and protecting them against retaliation. The most prominent of those is the Dodd-Frank Act, which passed in 2010. Under that act, the Securities and Exchange Commission oversees the Office of the Whistleblower, which in 2012 alone received 3,001 tips.

As the Securities and Exchange Commission’s chief of enforcement from 2001 to 2005, the era of landmark fraud settlements with Enron, WorldCom and Tyco, Stephen M. Cutler earned a reputation as a tough and, at times, feared regulator. He was particularly dismayed by chief executives, chief financial officers, general counsels and compliance officials who, even if not directly implicated in wrongdoing, created a culture in which it was ignored, tolerated, or even worse, tacitly encouraged.        


In a speech in 2004 to the General Counsel Roundtable, he said: “You’ve got to talk the talk; and you’ve got to walk the walk. Both are critical to maintaining a good tone at the top.” And he called for more accountability: “Hold all of your managers accountable for setting the right tone. That means disciplining or even firing them when they have failed to create a culture of compliance. Human nature being what it is, there will be those who break the rules. But if managers don’t do enough to prevent those violations, or let them go unaddressed for too long, then they should be held responsible — even in the absence of direct involvement in those violations.”        
How times have changed.        
As general counsel of JPMorgan Chase & Company, Mr. Cutler is now on the receiving end of the lectures, which this week came from George S. Canellos, a successor to Mr. Cutler and currently the co-chief of enforcement at the S.E.C. On Thursday, the S.E.C. and other regulators announced that JPMorgan had agreed to admit wrongdoing and pay nearly $1 billion in fines for its conduct in the “London Whale” matter, in which the bank’s chief investment office lost more than $6 billion and bank officials misled regulators about the losses. The S.E.C. faulted JPMorgan’s “egregious breakdowns in controls” and said that “senior management broke a cardinal rule of corporate management” by failing to alert the board to the full extent of the problem.        
The S.E.C. didn’t name any of those senior managers, but made reference to the “chief executive,” who is Jamie Dimon. Mr. Cutler oversaw both the legal and compliance departments during those events. (Mr. Cutler no longer oversees compliance.)        
And the London Whale affair isn’t JPMorgan’s only regulatory problem. The bank faces multiple other regulatory actions and investigations, ranging from manipulating energy markets, to mortgage-backed securities fraud, to failing to disclose suspicions about the Ponzi scheme operator Bernard Madoff, to conspiring to fix rates in the setting of the global benchmark interest rate informally known as Libor. As the allegations have mushroomed, JPMorgan has gone with almost dizzying speed from one of the world’s most admired banks to one tainted by scandal.        
And all of this happened on Mr. Cutler’s watch. “You have to say, he didn’t run a tight enough ship,” said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor of law and expert in corporate governance at Columbia University. “It’s not just the London Whale episode. I wouldn’t call that the crime of the century. But taken with everything else, the energy manipulation, the mortgage fraud cases, the Libor rigging, it suggests that there was not enough investment in compliance and the general counsel was not proactive enough. He’s done a very good job at defending the firm but not enough at preventing it in the first place.”        
A lawyer whose company was an S.E.C. target during Mr. Cutler’s tenure said this week, “I have to admit to a certain amount of schadenfreude,” adding: “At the time, he did a lot of grandstanding about lawyers being gatekeepers and the moral compass for the organization and how we should have prevented all this. He sounded great on the soapbox. Now I’ve been following JPMorgan and it’s pretty ironic.”        
This lawyer was among the many I contacted who didn’t want to be named. I quickly realized that I was wasting my time trying to get people to offer unconflicted comments about Mr. Cutler or anyone else at the bank, since a) their firm represents JPMorgan; b) they represent someone for whom JPMorgan is paying the legal bills; or c) they’re trying to get into category a or b. James Cramer joked on CNBC’s “Mad Money” this week that JPMorgan should just buy the Manhattan law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, famed for its high-stakes litigation practice.

LONDON — The Anglicans on Friday appointed their first female bishop in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Rev. Pat Storey, 53, a married mother of two, will serve as the bishop of Meath and Kildare, in the Church of Ireland. Born in Belfast, she previously served as rector of St. Augustine’s Church in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Anglican churches in Wales and Scotland, like the Church of Ireland, have the power to appoint women as bishops but have not yet used it; the Anglican Church of England is expected to permit the appointment of female bishops soon.

MILAN — In a bold stroke, Diego della Valle, one of the great Italian entrepreneurs of luxury, threw his hat into the fashion ring on Friday during the Milan fashion season.        


To be more precise, the executive, whose success is built on leather bags and shoes, tapped the designer Alessandra Facchinetti to make clothes for Tod’s: well-designed, streamlined, tailored with a compass and ruler, presenting a more realistic vision of clothes for summer 2014 than some of the pretty floral designs that are hitting the runways.        
“I believe that we can build the clothing part of our Tod’s business to 30 percent over the next five years,” said Mr. Della Valle, as the models, in their Modernist but wearable clothes, stood on a podium at the show’s end.        
Ms. Facchinetti, who formerly designed at Gucci and at Valentino, presented a precise, chic collection, in which she took no risks — unless you count a geometric circle dress inspired by the artists and architects of Italian Modernism. She cited Gio Ponti and Lucio Fontana as among her inspirations.        
But, as befits a house built on skin, the designer also used perforated leather for skirts that seemed as polished and streamlined as her chestnut red/brown lead color.        
These were clothes for real life, with the white shirt part of the equation and a sense that the shoes — flat or with a higher heel — and the bags, sometimes folded into the hand, really had grown as a new branch from Tod’s roots.        
That is already an achievement. And the element of craft put into apparently simple clothes, as well as the modesty of the approach and the presentation, suggest that this could be a fruitful collaboration.        
Nature — and especially the flower — is, as ever, the motif of summer dressing. The importance for designers is to find a way to modernize florals, to take the flower from pretty to punchy or to change its shape from tidy botanical drawing to digitally exploding pattern.        
“It’s about color and Asiatic countries and gray skies — and different proportions,” said Giorgio Armani backstage before his Emporio Armani show, where everything began with watery flowers that even rippled over hose to give an all-over effect.        
The designer called his use of color and shape as “poised between realism and abstraction,” by which he meant there was a harmonious unity about the decoration, not the current shock of over-sized or dramatically digitalized prints.        
One important change (apart from models walking out with hairdresser clips on their heads) was the silkiness of fabrics used for pants that were mostly soft and often cropped above the ankle or ballooning into a soft fullness. Intriguingly, there was only one long, ankle-length skirt — yet it looked like one of the best-proportioned pieces in a collection that showed Emporio Armani’s softer side.        
“It’s the chaos theory,” said Antonio Marras, referring to the words of Ovid in the poem “Metamorphoses,” a book he had backstage along with the whimsical artwork of flora and fauna by the American painter Kathy Ruttenberg.        
But nature did not seem in any way chaotic in the Marras collection. With violinists playing in a green dell beside the improvised runway, the first ensemble seemed the essence of calm: a black mesh sporty dress that, when the model turned, showed another aspect: equally light organza with a flower pattern billowing across the back.        
This mix was a modernizing aspect of the collection that introduced into the grove of trees not only predictable, if beautiful, prints of flowers but also elements of plastic. They gave a jolt of modernity to the romance that is always part of the Marras aesthetic. And the blend of tailored jackets with soft skirts, the dawn colors and the occasional Olympian vista of a pastoral landscape made for a fine collection.        
There are times when Veronica Etro seems to sink into her family’s fabric business; others when she tries to fight it. Her show Friday had a certain serenity, as if she had decided that graphic florals and the company’s perennial paisley print were just right for her idea of fluid summer clothes.        
With just a touch of the hippy 1970s in scarves, framed with fringes at the neckline, and languid, liquid, long dresses that looked quite beautiful, Ms. Etro did what was required of her: make the brand look credible.        
There might have been more focus on a different approach to paisley and florals, although there was a sudden foray into appliquéd flowers in hot pinks.        
But mostly, the prints were just well-controlled: dresses slender and wrapped into shape, tailored jackets in lightweight fabrics to counter the more hippie looks of flowing skirts. Altogether, it was a pleasing collection for a house and a designer who are wedded to pattern and print.

MILAN — The snow falls softly over ancient Roman ruins and Renaissance palaces. As the flakes whirl, a woman lapped in ginger fur pauses by a carved wooden door before disappearing among the old gray stones.        


Snow? In Rome? Fur in Italy’s September Indian summer?        
All is fake except the fur — filmed at the original Cinecittà Studios in Rome, now abandoned since the Italian film industry moved to modern premises.        
For this new short film, the audience sits on plush red velvet chairs to watch the big screen and lose themselves in a different world. The movie is a recap of the Fendi universe in the days when its luscious furs were redolent of La Dolce Vita.        
The exhibition “Making Dreams: Fendi and the Cinema” (until Oct. 6) has the surreal feeling of a dream world. Created from simulated ironwork positioned above the velvet chairs, the stairs between the seven display areas are made of material as translucent as Cinderella’s slippers.        
“The history of Fendi is very rich and the relationship that we have with cinema is very strong,” said Silvia Fendi. “It is really a love story, but not many people know what we have been doing,” she added. “This is a way to show the richness of our history, our collaborations with cinema makers like Martin Scorsese and Wes Anderson. Cinema is a strong passion and we can never say ‘no.’ We have been digging in our archives and we found incredible things.”        
The exhibition of Fendi’s magical world was created in the abandoned 1940s Cinema Manzoni — a “Cinema Paradiso,” with its friezes and frescos, its long curving bar and its sculpted marble heads of ancient Romans (papier-mâché, of course). They are in the vast foyer — which, along with the rest of the interior, will be stripped out soon and turned into a shopping mall.        
A visitor, poised at the entrance, can see the bold projection of the modern movie made at Cinecittà by the exhibition’s imaginative designers and creators: Patrick Kinmonth and Antonio Monfreda.        
“We wanted it to be surreal, like an Italian carnival,” said Mr Kinmonth. “We have tried to make a feeling of floating over the existing cinema — an out-of-body experience.”        
The general reaction of the exhibition’s visitors must surely be: Fendi is a luxury leather house with clothes designed by Karl Lagerfeld. Does it really have this lush history with the movies?        
The extraordinary connection of the fur family with the cinema starts with the five Fendi sisters. Paola, Anna, Franca, Alda and Carla are shown, photographed by Lord Snowdon in the 1980s in furs that, like their faces and hands, move subtly. The effect was created by linking a series of still photographs together.        
The Silvia Fendi onscreen introduction kicks off the story of the cinematic Dolce Vita years, especially the glamour of Silvana Mangano, an Italian star from the 1950s through the 1970s. Her coats are displayed on mannequins of her exact body size, while in a film, projected above, she appears as a drama queen, tossing her tight curls.        
All the Fendi family remember those years: Carla Fendi, viewing the exhibition, said that she is especially proud of their collaboration with the costume designer Piero Tosi, who created Ms. Mangano’s costumes for Luchino Visconti’s 1974 movie “Conversation Piece” (Gruppo di famiglia). Mr. Tosi is to be honored at the 2014 Academy Awards.        
Meanwhile, the film has been restored by Fendi, and Mr. Visconti has a documentary on display made by his nephew, Ferdinando Cito Filomarino.        
Silvia Fendi has intimate childhood memories of going to her grandmother’s home and seeing private screenings, with Mr. Visconti, of his legendary 1963 film, “Il Gattopardo,” or “The Leopard,” her all-time favorite.        
The Fendi house has been directly involved with 20 major films across the years, recently with Luca Guadagnino’s 2009 movie “Io sono l’amore,” or “I Am Love,” with Tilda Swinton.

So much for “till death do us part.” For the first time, more Americans 50 and older are divorced than widowed, and the numbers are growing as baby boomers live longer. Sociologists call them gray divorcees.        


Barbara Wingate and her husband of 34 years divorced in 2009 — after the marriage of their daughter. Both were 58 and they had tried for a year to resolve their differences.        
“I was in shock and sought counseling for several months,” said Ms. Wingate, who lives in Toledo, Ohio. “My whole identity was connected to him and his career.”        
A half-century ago, only 2.8 percent of Americans older than 50 were divorced. By 2000, 11.8 percent were. In 2011, according to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, 15.4 percent were divorced and another 2.1 percent were separated. Some 13.5 percent were widowed.        
While divorce rates over all have stabilized and even inched downward, the divorce rate among people 50 and older has doubled since 1990, according to an analysis of census data by professors at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. That’s especially significant because half the married population is older than 50.         
In 1990, 1 in 10 persons who divorced was 50 or older. By 2011, according to the census’s American Community Survey, more than 28 percent (more than 1 in 4) who said they divorced in the previous 12 months were 50 or older.         
Researchers at Bowling Green warn that the rising divorce rate among older Americans has serious implications that go well beyond the couples themselves. Like widowhood, divorce can contribute to economic strain and poor health, placing a larger burden on children and, given shrinking family size, on institutional support from government and other sources.        
“It’s still true that in general the longer you are married, the lower your chance of divorce, but it’s sure no guarantee anymore,” said Stephanie Coontz, who teaches family history at Evergreen State College in Washington State.        
She attributes the trend to the higher rate of divorce among baby boomers and to the fact that many are in second or third marriages, making them statistically more prone to divorce. Still, she and others detect an increase in divorce among couples who have been married 25 years or more.        
“I don’t necessarily think this will accelerate, but I don’t expect it to go down,” she said. “Staying together until death do us part is a bigger challenge than it used to be because we expect so much more of marriage than we did in the past, and we have so many more options when a marriage doesn’t live up to those expectations.        
“The extension of the active, healthy life span is a big part of this,” Professor Coontz said. “If you are a healthy 65, you can expect another pretty healthy 20 years. So with the kids gone, it seems more burdensome to stay in a bad relationship, or even one that has grown stale.”        
Most divorces among older couples, as in younger ones, are initiated by women.        
“Women have long been more sensitive to — or less tolerant of — a mediocre relationship than men,” Professor Coontz said, “and so another big factor is that with their increased work experience and greater sense of their own possibilities, they are less willing to just ‘wait it out.’         
“We expect to find equality, intimacy, friendship, fun, and even passion right into what people used to see as the ‘twilight years,’ ” she added.        
It takes work. “It’s not something you can put on the back burner while you raise your kids, for example, and think it won’t scorch somewhere along the way,” Professor Coontz said.        
Robert D. Gould, a New York trial lawyer who handles matrimonial cases and himself was divorced when he was over 50, said: “A lot of marriages died a long time ago, but because of the shame involved, in a family people often stuck together for the children. Now the children are grown up. Viagra is another reason — men are able to satisfy younger women. And people are living longer and they can get out and still have a life.”        
Two sociologists at Bowling Green call it the “gray divorce revolution.”        
In a recent study of census data, Prof. Susan L Brown and Prof. I-Fen Lin attribute the trend to several factors, including societal acceptance of divorce and the increased economic autonomy of women. “Finally,” they write, “lengthening life expectancies decrease the likelihood that marriages will end through death and increase the length of exposure to the risk of divorce.”        
The professors found that divorce is more likely among older couples who have less education, who are African-American or Hispanic and who have been married for fewer than 10 years. Nonetheless, they say that if the rate remains constant, “we project a 25 percent increase in the number of people that will experience divorce” two decades from now among Americans 50 and older.        
After Ms. Wingate divorced, she moved closer to her daughter, put the proceeds from the sale of her marital home in real estate and, after two years, began trolling Internet dating sites for companionship. “I’ve been dating a widower for two years,” she said, “but am struggling with any thoughts of remarrying.”        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 29, 2013The Field Notes column last Sunday, about divorce among people older than 50, misidentified the hometown of Barbara Wingate, who divorced her husband of 34 years at age 58. It is Toledo, Ohio, not Bowling Green, Ohio.

Sports,"










I waited in the mouth of a tunnel beneath the concrete bleachers of Nebraska’s Memorial Stadium. Rocking side to side on the soles of my shoes, I focused on the rhythm of my breathing and scanned the stands, watching them fill, one red pixel at a time. A dream of mine was about to come true.         
I was about to take the field at a Cornhuskers football game.        
It was a dream I conjured when I went to my first Nebraska game as a preschooler riding on my father’s shoulders. One I had held on to since first grade, when I earned the nickname Husker Boy for my daily crayon drawings of Eric Crouch, Bobby Newcombe and Correll Buckhalter. One I had tried to visualize during a couple of weeks of practice that had prepared me for the performance, but not the moment.        
Instead of wearing a red jersey and a white helmet — the combination that made up many of my childhood Halloween costumes — I wore overalls and a jacket of wool and polyester, wielding a trombone in my right hand.        
I started playing trombone in fifth grade, the same year I last played organized football. That was the age I realized I wasn’t going to be the next Tommie Frazier, even though I wore his No. 15.        
Eight years later, I went to the University of Nebraska, drawn there not only by an urge to stay close to home — and the football team whose results controlled my mood swings — but also by the chance to be in the marching band, which had long ago supplanted playing football among my favorite pastimes.        
My first game as a member of the band, in 2010, was also Taylor Martinez’s first game as Nebraska’s starting quarterback. The announcement of his name in the starting lineup had the stadium buzzing a half-hour before kickoff.        
But swaying anxiously under the bleachers, I was more concerned with getting through my first pregame performance mistake-free. As kickoff loomed ever closer, I repeated my sequence of drill moves in my head, imagining step by step my route around the field.        
We had learned the routine a few weeks earlier in band camp, a week of 14-hour days spent practicing music and marching on a field molded by the footprints of Mike Rozier and Ahman Green. During camp and two weeks of morning rehearsals after school started, we spent as much time in Memorial Stadium as the football team would all season.        
And now it was showtime. When I strutted onto the field for the pregame show, I eyed my marks on the turf and the time-keeping of our conductors, and tried not to be overwhelmed by the density of the red-clad crowd surrounding us.        
Later, that became a difficult task. As we played the final chord of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” I heard the roar of jet engines passing above — the flyover our directors had explicitly told us not to look at so that our eyes would remain on the drum majors, who would promptly lead us into the next phase of the performance.        
But I realized quickly that the noise was not above me, but around me. I had mistaken the rumble of the crowd’s applause for the sound of planes flying overhead.        
I realized just how loud 85,000 people could be, and it hit me that after 18 years of observing college football from 40 rows up in the stadium, I was now part of the spectacle on the field.        
In the first quarter, Martinez scored on his first carry, a 46-yard scamper that set the tone in the Huskers’ 49-10 victory against Western Kentucky.        
While the fans in the stadium expressed their glee with incoherent yelling and awkward high-fives, we in the band had only a second or two to celebrate. Then we began playing our fight songs — “Hail Varsity” and “There Is No Place Like Nebraska” — leading to the crowd’s excitedly off-tempo clapping and chanting of “Go, Huskers!” during the brief pauses in the music.        
They were rituals I had become accustomed to as a spectator, but the change in perspective made it all a new experience.        
As the game continued, I learned the rules that guided the band’s actions.        
■ No sitting in the bleachers when the team is on the field.        
■ No playing music if there is a penalty flag or an injury.        
■ No daydreaming; once a play ends, our focus must shift to the drum majors, whose hand signals tell us what to play.        
Gone were my days of idle observing, of watching Nebraska beat Pittsburgh on a blocked field goal in 2005; or celebrating the Huskers’ 300th consecutive sold-out game, in 2009; or rooting for comebacks that fell short against Texas in 2002 and Virginia Tech in 2008. The trombone became my free ticket into every game, but it also made me an active participant in the game-day ritual.        
After the game, the band assembled on the field and marched through a tunnel, up a ramp and out of the stadium, dancing to drum cadences back to the campus’s music building. We passed children sitting on their parents’ shoulders, girls sporting temporary tattoos of red N’s on their cheeks, boys wearing red jerseys.        
At that moment, they might have been dreaming of becoming the next Taylor Martinez.        
But who knows? Maybe someday they will exchange a mouth guard for a mouthpiece and still find themselves able to be a part of the game-day experience in Lincoln.

WASHINGTON — For roughly 30 hours over several days, defense lawyers for three former United States Naval Academy football players grilled a female midshipman about her sexual habits. In a public hearing, they asked the woman, who has accused the three athletes of raping her, whether she wore a bra, how wide she opened her mouth during oral sex and whether she had apologized to another midshipman with whom she had intercourse “for being a ho.”        


The aggressive tactics on display this month and last are part of a case that has generated intense public scrutiny and raised alarms about what are called Article 32 proceedings, which help determine whether cases are sent to courts-martial. Article 32 hearings permit questions not allowed in civilian courts and can include cross-examinations of witnesses so intense that legal experts say they frighten many victims from coming forward.        
“These have become their own trials,” said Jonathan Lurie, a professor emeritus of legal history at Rutgers University and the author of two books on military justice. “If this is what Article 32 has come to be, then it is time to either get rid of it or put real restrictions on the conduct during them.”        
More broadly, the case at the Naval Academy illuminates what critics say is wrong with trying sexual assault cases in the current military justice system, which is under scrutiny in Congress. One bill to be debated this fall, sponsored by Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, would take the prosecution of sexual assault cases outside a victim’s chain of command, with a goal of increasing the number of people who report crimes without fear of retaliation.        
In the coming weeks, the military judge who presided over the female midshipman’s hearing will send a recommendation to the Naval Academy’s superintendent on how the charges should be disposed of. The superintendent, Vice Adm. Michael H. Miller, will ultimately decide whether to move ahead with a court-martial or drop the case.        
Increased scrutiny of the problem of sexual assault in the military, combined with more reporting of attacks, has led to a large jump in the number of such cases that have gone to court-martial. The Defense Department says that 68 percent of sexual assault cases were sent to court-martial last year, compared with 30 percent in 2007.        
But those increases have been accompanied by a series of controversies that have roiled the system, including one at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas in which more than 40 female trainees were abused by their instructors, as well as the arrest in May of the director of the Air Force’s sexual response unit, Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, for what the police said was his groping of a woman he did not know in a parking lot. A recent Pentagon survey found that an estimated 26,000 sexual assaults took place in the military last year, up from 19,000 two years before.        
The Naval Academy case stems from a 2012 “yoga and toga” off-campus party near the academy in Annapolis, Md., where the woman, then a 20-year-old sophomore, arrived intoxicated and continued to drink, she said. In testimony at the hearing, held at the Washington Navy Yard, she said she had no memory of parts of the evening and may have passed out.        
The next day, the woman testified, she heard from a friend of one of the three football players via social media that she had had sex with them at an Annapolis home known as “the football house.” The football players — Tra’ves Bush, 22; Eric Graham, 21; and Joshua Tate, 21 — were charged with sexually assaulting her and making false statements. The investigation was stymied in part by the woman’s initial refusal to cooperate, academy officials said.        
In the Article 32 cross-examination, defense lawyers repeatedly asked the midshipman about a consensual sexual encounter she said she had the next day. In some of the most widely disseminated testimony, Andrew Weinstein, a lawyer for Mr. Bush, asked the woman whether she wore a bra or other underwear to the party and whether she “felt like a ho” afterward. Lt. Cmdr. Angela Tang, a lawyer for Mr. Graham, also asked the woman repeatedly about her oral sex technique, arguing over objections from the prosecution that oral sex would indicate the “active participation” of the woman and therefore consent.        
Many military legal experts were appalled by what they heard. “What this case shows is that we think the military justice system can somehow solve the sexual assault problem, but it can’t,” said Diane H. Mazur, an emeritus law professor at the University of Florida. Several military justice experts said Article 32 proceedings should be eliminated.

SADNESS is an emotion we usually try to avoid. So why do we choose to listen to sad music?         
Musicologists and philosophers have wondered about this. Sad music can induce intense emotions, yet the type of sadness evoked by music also seems pleasing in its own way. Why? Aristotle famously suggested the idea of catharsis: that by overwhelming us with an undesirable emotion, music (or drama) somehow purges us of it.        
But what if, despite their apparent similarity, sadness in the realm of artistic appreciation is not the same thing as sadness in everyday life?        
In a study published this summer in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, my colleagues and I explored the idea that “musical emotion” encompasses both the felt emotion that the music induces in the listener and the perceived emotion that the listener judges the music to express. By isolating these two overlapping sets of emotions and observing how they related to each other, we hoped to gain a better understanding of sad music.        
Forty-four people served as participants in our experiment. We asked them to listen to one of three musical excerpts of approximately 30 seconds each. The excerpts were from Mikhail Glinka’s “La Séparation” (F minor), Felix Blumenfeld’s “Sur Mer” (G minor) and Enrique Granados’s “Allegro de Concierto” (C sharp major, though the excerpt was in G major, which we transposed to G minor).        
We were interested in the minor key because it is canonically associated with sad music, and we steered clear of well-known compositions to avoid interference from any personal memories related to the pieces.        
(Our participants were more or less split between men and women, as well as between musicians and nonmusicians, though these divisions turned out to be immaterial to our findings.)        
A participant would listen to an excerpt and then answer a question about his felt emotions: “How did you feel when listening to this music?” Then he would listen to a “happy” version of the excerpt — i.e., transposed into the major key — and answer the same question. Next he would listen to the excerpt, again in both sad and happy versions, each time answering a question about other listeners that was designed to elicit perceived emotion: “How would normal people feel when listening to this music?”        
(This is a slight simplification: in the actual study, the order in which the participant answered questions about felt and perceived emotion, and listened to sad and happy excerpts, varied from participant to participant.)        
Our participants answered each question by rating 62 emotion-related descriptive words and phrases — from happy to sad, from bouncy to solemn, from heroic to wistful — on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).        
We found, as anticipated, that felt emotion did not correspond exactly to perceived emotion. Although the sad music was both perceived and felt as “tragic” (e.g., gloomy, meditative and miserable), the listeners did not actually feel the tragic emotion as much as they perceived it. Likewise, when listening to sad music, the listeners felt more “romantic” emotion (e.g., fascinated, dear and in love) and “blithe” emotion (e.g., merry, animated and feel like dancing) than they perceived.        
Something similar happened with the happy music: perceived blithe emotions were rated higher than their felt counterparts. In general, it appears that perceived emotions may be rated higher than felt emotions when it comes to emotional categories characteristically associated with a given key.        
When listening to sad music, then, there is a tension, or slippage, between the two types of emotions. How are we to understand this gap?        
One answer might be that in everyday life we typically experience emotions that have a direct connection to whatever object or situation gives rise to them. But when we listen to sad music (or watch a sad movie, or read a sad novel), we are inoculated from any real threat or danger that the music (or movie or novel) represents.        
If this is true, what we experience when we listen to sad music might be thought of as “vicarious emotions.” Here, there is no object or situation that induces emotion directly, as in regular life. Instead, the vicarious emotions are free from the essential unpleasantness of their genuine counterparts, while still drawing force from the similarity between the two.        
We need to study vicarious emotions further. In doing so, we may be able to improve our understanding of a neglected feature of our emotional system — namely, its sensitivity to something other than palpable needs or threats. When we weep at the beauty of sad music, we experience a profound aspect of our emotional selves that may contain insights about the meaning and significance of artistic experience — and also about ourselves as human beings.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The Pakistani government said Friday that it would release a senior Taliban commander on Saturday to facilitate peace talks in neighboring Afghanistan.        


The commander, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the founding members of the Taliban, has been in Pakistani custody since his arrest in a joint Pakistani and American intelligence raid in the port city of Karachi in 2010.        
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced his impending release in a brief statement on Friday evening. The statement said Mr. Baradar would be set free on Saturday but did not give further details.        
Pakistani officials previously said Mr. Baradar would not be handed over to the Afghan authorities despite longstanding demands from the Afghan government.        
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan raised the issue during a recent visit to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, when he met with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.        
Pakistani officials portrayed the move as a good-will gesture that would help bring the Taliban and Afghanistan to the negotiating table as the United States prepares to withdraw from Afghanistan in 2014.        
“The timing is quite significant,” said Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of the defense committee in the Pakistani Senate, “as he is an important, credible figure who has the potential to have outreach to the Taliban leaders.”        
Mr. Sayed, who led a Pakistani delegation this month to Kabul, the Afghan capital, said, “There was a positive response on this from the Kabul regime, which seems to have high hopes and greater confidence in the new Pakistani government’s ability to deliver on Afghan-related issues.”        
Pakistan has been steadily releasing Taliban prisoners, most recently during  the first week of September, when seven were freed.        
But the release of Mr. Baradar, who is the former top military commander of the Taliban movement, is the most significant, as it is seen as crucial to initiating the peace talks.

TURIN, Italy — Francesco Molinari shot a 5-under 67 Friday to share the lead after the second round of the Italian Open.        
Molinari tied Felipe Aguilar of Chile and Simon Thornton of Ireland at 9-under 135 at the Golf Club Torino.        
A Turin native, Molinari has been the center of attention at the tournament. He won the event in 2006.        
""This is a special, special week for me,"" Molinari said. ""I was emotional yesterday on the 10th tee at 8 a.m. with only 50 people watching, so now with all these people on my course, it's a great feeling.""        
Molinari's Ryder Cup teammate Nicolas Colsaerts lost his overnight lead when he bogeyed the 16th and 18th. He's one stroke back.

NEW YORK — Tough new limits on the amount of heat-trapping emissions new power plants can emit will likely accelerate a shift away from coal-fired power and toward electricity generated with natural gas, wind, and sunshine.        


Power prices for homes, businesses and factories may eventually rise, and nuclear power could return to fashion.        
The rule proposed by the Obama administration Friday will have little effect on the mix of power sources and electricity prices anytime soon because it only applies to new power plants and is likely to be challenged in court. Even so, market forces are already reshaping power markets in the same way the rule will. A boom in natural gas production in the U.S. has dramatically increased supplies, sent prices plummeting and prompted a shift away from coal.        
The rule requires new coal plants to be built with extremely expensive equipment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. That will make coal look prohibitively expensive to regulators and utilities planning for the future. By comparison, natural gas-fired plants, which emit half as much carbon dioxide as coal plants, along with wind turbines and solar panels, will look like a bargain.        
Jason Bordoff, Director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, called the rule ""consistent with already evolving market trends toward the use of natural gas instead of coal"" and described it as ""cost-effective.""        
Nonetheless, it creates financial winners and losers. Here's how the landscape could change for companies and customers.        
WINNERS        
— Natural gas. Most new natural gas-fired power plants will stay within the rule's emissions limits without requiring new equipment. That means natural-gas fired plants — already by far the cheapest power plant to build and operate — will likely remain the top choice for utilities.        
As utilities rely more on natural gas to generate electricity, demand for the fuel will increase and prices could rise. That would mean more revenue for domestic natural gas drillers such as ExxonMobil and Chesapeake Energy, drilling services companies such as Halliburton and Baker Hughes, and pipeline companies such as Spectra Energy and Kinder Morgan. It will also help makers of natural-gas fired turbines such as General Electric and Siemens.        
— Renewable energy. Wind and solar developers, such as NextEra Energy and FirstSolar, may see increased demand for large projects, especially if power prices rise. That would also help rooftop solar installers such as Solar City attract more interest from homes and businesses.        
— Nuclear power. Nuclear, like coal, has suffered from the low power prices brought on by cheap natural gas. Utilities have abandoned ambitious plans to build new nuclear plants and they've shut down aging plants that have become too expensive to run. If prices rise, nuclear operators such as Exelon and Entergy will benefit. And because the new rule makes new coal plants so expensive, utilities afraid of relying too heavily on natural gas for future power production may turn instead to nuclear.        
— Power generators. If electricity prices rise as coal use declines, companies that sell wholesale electric power, such NRG Energy and Calpine, may benefit.        
LOSERS        
— Coal miners. The U.S. coal industry is already struggling because coal supplies piled up and prices dropped as natural gas gained favor. U.S. production is expected to fall to a 20-year low this year, and 151 mines that employed 2,658 workers were idled in the first half of this year, according to SNL Energy.        
While coal will continue to be an important fuel for electricity generation in the U.S. for decades, it appears to be facing a long, slow decline. The country will get less and less coal from the comparatively high-cost Appalachian region, and more from cheaper-to-access coal deposits in the Illinois Basin and in Wyoming. Companies with large Appalachian operations, such as James River Coal and Alpha Natural Resources, will likely continue to suffer.        
— Electric customers. Natural gas prices generally dictate the price of all electricity in the U.S. If demand for natural gas rises faster than drillers supply it, the price will rise and drag power prices up too, possibly boosting electric bills for homes and businesses. In the past, natural gas prices have been extraordinarily volatile.        
Industrial companies, who have used low power prices in the U.S. as a competitive advantage, are concerned. The National Association of Manufacturers said in a statement Friday that the rule will ""hurt competitiveness and job creation.""

When you can drive a car off the lot with that new car smell for a mere $199- or $299-a month-lease, many consumers can’t help asking: How can I afford not to take this deal?        


After all, if your family is already paying for cable television and a couple of cellphones, many of the current leases being offered  may seem like a relative steal. And with leases fueling surprisingly strong car sales, it seems that more drivers are thinking in those terms.        
Indeed, the pay-as-you-go smartphone mentality seems to have seeped into the car market, especially with younger buyers, many of whom don’t seem to mind that they don’t own anything at the end of the lease’s term. But that hasn’t changed the long-term economics of leasing: it still costs several thousand dollars more than buying a new car, not to mention a newish used car.        
“People’s attitudes are shifting,” said Philip Reed, senior consumer advice editor at Edmunds.com. “The car is being seen more as a commodity to be used and then returned. Ownership was a big part of the World War II generation — people wanted to own their house and own their car. They were taught that was financially responsible.”        
There are reasons certain people might want to lease (the first one being you have extra money to burn). But for the rest of us, the financial consequences are worth re-examining, especially when you have a slew of competing financial priorities like college tuition, retirement or even a nice vacation.        
So let’s start with the hard numbers. Mr. Reed looked at three ways you could acquire a four-door Honda Accord EX: buying a new 2014 model, leasing the same 2014 car, or buying a used 2011 Accord with 36,000 miles. (Many people in the New York area are paying about $28,211 for the new car, including tax, title and registration.)        
The analysis looked at the cost over six years, since the average person owns a car for that long, and it incorporated typical buying patterns: the new Accord is purchased with a five-year loan, the used car is financed with a four-year loan, and the person who is leasing must take out two consecutive 36-month leases. (The rest of the assumptions are detailed on the accompanying chart.)        
Leasing initially seems to be the cheapest route when you look at total out-of-pocket expenses: It costs $5,244 less than buying new. (Buying a used car is still the most economical. You save $5,277 compared with leasing, and it’s about a whopping $10,500 less than buying new.)        
But when you account for the teensy fact that you don’t own anything at the end of those six years, the calculus changes. If you had bought the car new, it would still be worth about $11,000, according to Edmunds.com’s calculators. The used Accord would be worth around $5,000.        
So after you factor in that equity, leasing costs $5,756 more than buying a new car and $10,277 more than buying used. (Buying new costs $4,521 more than buying used.) Leasing is the loser across the board.        
“If you asked me what is the most expensive way to get a car, the answer would be: You only want to own it during its period of greatest depreciation and then move to another new vehicle,” said Jeff Bartlett, deputy automotive editor at Consumer Reports. “Well, that’s what leasing is.”        
With that analysis in mind, here are some other factors that need to be considered when deciding the best way to acquire a car:        
NEEDS VERSUS WANTS Is there anything you absolutely need now that you can’t get in a lightly used car that’s only a few years old? Some experts say you can make a decent argument for new cars based on some recent safety improvements. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which some experts say tends to have more rigorous guidelines than the government, added new recommendations after its latest small frontal crash tests last summer. And some manufacturers have been updating their existing models, Mr. Bartlett said, to meet those standards.        
Though it’s hard to argue that anyone “needs” to have the latest technology, that has come a long way in the last couple of years, too. “That two- to three-year time difference means the world in terms of connectivity,” Mr. Bartlett added. “Now, there are stereos in mainstream cars that offer Pandora, Aha, and Stitcher for streaming Internet radio via a smartphone and allow you to control an iPod. Plus, USB connections are fast replacing traditional microplugs, and Bluetooth is near ubiquitous. The expectation of mobile connectivity and what you can do on the run has changed dramatically.”        
LEASING It becomes a difficult cycle to escape. Unless you saved extra money while leasing, you may not have accumulated enough for a down payment on your next car, and you won’t have a car to trade in. And now that you’re accustomed to the low monthly payment, it will be hard to stomach the much higher monthly cost of buying new (or even a not-too-old used car, in some cases).        
You will avoid repair or maintenance costs (except for oil changes and tire rotation) that used and even new car buyers would eventually have to pay. But you will probably pay more for insurance with a leased vehicle, which Mr. Reed says is almost as much as the extra maintenance. It ends up being close to a wash.        
Leasing also allows you to get into a car right away, with little financial disruption: it requires little or no money down and minimal outlay each month. There’s also the fact that you’re driving a brand-new car, with all of the latest technological and safety features.        
TIME HORIZON Beyond the numbers, your time horizon should also help determine what you ultimately decide. “If you are someone who knows they are going to own a car for 10 years and you are driving all over the country, you are not the type of person who should be leasing,” said Alec Gutierrez, a senior market analyst of automotive insights at Kelley Blue Book, referring to the mileage limits of about 12,000 a year on leased vehicles. “If you go beyond that, you are likely to be hit with significant penalties.”        
Besides, buying a new car and holding onto it is more economical now. “You are making pretty high payments for about four or five years, but the dependability of cars is really great these days,” said Mr. Reed. “It can probably go another five years with minimal costs.”        
LEASE MECHANICS You’re essentially paying for the amount of value the car loses over the course of your lease; in other words, the price you pay is based on the vehicle’s residual value at the end of the term. Consider a $30,000 car that is worth $15,000 after three years. “You will divide that into monthly payments, and that is your lease payment, plus interest and some fees,” Mr. Reed explained. (You also only pay sales tax on the amount of the vehicle that you use, in this case, $15,000).        
That’s why cars that retain their value tend to translate into better deals for leasing: the higher the residual value, the lower the monthly payment. “Things like Mercedes, BMW and Honda hold their value very well, and make very good lease cars,” Mr. Reed said.        
(If you do lease, figure out the number of miles you want to drive each year; how long a lease you want; and how much you want to put down. Then call a few different dealers and ask them to quote you a monthly payment. This is the simplest way to shop around, Mr. Reed said, though leasing aficionados may choose to get more technical.)        
BUYING USED If you buy used, you may need to come up with a larger down payment than if you bought new since more people tend to default on used cars (you might have to put 10 to 20 percent down on a used car, compared with 0 to 10 percent for a new one). “But because of the easily repossessed nature of the collateral, if there is one loan that is easier to qualify for, it tends to be a car loan,” said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com.        
PAYING CASH Of course, there’s always the option of paying for a car the old-fashioned way: saving up and paying cash.        
That’s what Mr. Bartlett of Consumer Reports does, whether he is buying new or used.        
“Obviously, nobody does this,” he said. But when you pay cash, “you don’t have to worry about them sneaking in all of these fees. You just negotiate a price, and then write a check for that number. If I can put some of it on my credit card and then get the points and pay it off at the end of the month, I come out ahead.”        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 25, 2013A chart on Saturday with the Your Money column, about the costs of leasing versus buying a car, misstated the percentage of the purchase price of a $28,211 car that is represented by a down payment of $5,112. It is 18 percent, not 20 percent.

OTTAWA — At their peak, just a few years ago, BlackBerry smartphones were symbols of corporate and political power. When President Obama took office he made keeping his BlackBerry a personal priority, and when BlackBerry service had a hiccup so did business on Wall Street.        


But after being upstaged time and again by industry rivals, the devices may soon remain only in memories.        
On Friday, BlackBerry announced that it would lay off 4,500 employees, or nearly 40 percent of its already reduced work force. The cut is so deep some analysts and investors said that the company’s days as a smartphone maker were effectively over.        
The company also said that it expected to report a quarterly loss of nearly $1 billion next week, mainly the result of a write-off of unsold BlackBerry phones, but also because of payments to stop manufacturers and suppliers from adding to the pile. And of its six phones that the company offers, two will be discontinued.        
“This is a recognition that they lost the handset war,” said James H. Gellert, the chairman and chief executive of Rapid Ratings, an investment risk evaluation firm. “It’s certainly a waving of the big, white towel.”        
The company halted the trading of its shares to make the bleak announcement. It also said that revenue was expected to have been $1.6 billion in the second quarter, almost half of the $3 billion analysts had anticipated. Sales of phones during that time, it said, totaled 3.7 million. Apple, by comparison, sold 31.2 million iPhones during its last quarter.        
More alarming to many analysts was BlackBerry’s announcement that it had used about $500 million in cash to stay operating during the last quarter, lowering its cash holdings to $2.6 billion. Although the company has been losing market share for several years, it had managed to increase its cash holdings.        
Shares in the company tumbled 17 percent for the day, to $8.73, nearly all of it after trading was resumed.        
Four years ago, BlackBerry had 51 percent of the North American smartphone market, according to the research firm Gartner. But the fast-changing industry, and in particular phones from Apple and Samsung, left the company behind.        
“The rest of the smartphone world is racing ahead at top speed while we have BlackBerry stuttering to a stop,” said Michael Gikas, the senior editor for electronics at Consumer Reports.        
BlackBerry’s executives initially looked down on the move to making smartphones into pocket-size computers, which was pioneered by Apple’s iPhone. But consumers preferred smartphones with full touch screens, multiple cameras and, most important, hundreds of thousands of apps. BlackBerry’s devices largely stayed the same, often with half-screens and a physical keyboard, and its initial attempts at touch-screen phones were technological failures.        
In January, the company introduced the BlackBerry 10 line of phones, which were based around an entirely new operating system of the same name and offered hardware features that were similar to devices from the market leaders.        
But the new devices were unable to break the grip of Apple and Samsung. When the latest flagship phone in the line, the Z30, was announced this week, it caused hardly a ripple. Even BlackBerry seemed to have given up. Unlike with other phones in the series, the Z30 release came without any kind of public or flashy demonstration.        
The failure of the BlackBerry 10 line of phones quickly led to speculation that the company, like Palm before it, would be broken apart and perhaps gradually disappear, at best lingering as little more than a brand name. This summer, BlackBerry announced that it was undertaking its second strategic review in less than a year. Unlike with the earlier one, however, BlackBerry’s executives did not rule out a sale of the company.        
All of the uncertainty surrounding the company, several analysts said, probably made the company’s problems even worse during the last quarter. Corporate and government information technology departments have held back on committing to BlackBerry 10 phones and, more important for BlackBerry, the corporate server software that supports them.        
Consumers are often less sensitive to corporate problems. But Keith Lam, a managing partner at Red Sky Capital Management in Toronto, said that carriers appeared to be cutting back their BlackBerry 10 inventory to avoid being saddled with unwanted phones and reducing display space and promotions for the devices in stores.        
“From that it kind of snowballs downward for BlackBerry,” said Mr. Lam, whose firm does not manage any BlackBerry shares.        
If, as many expect, BlackBerry is no longer in the handset business, the question becomes what remains of value to a potential investor.        
Mike Lazaridis, the co-founder of BlackBerry who stepped down as co-chief executive in 2011, has contacted private equity firms about a possible bid for the troubled company. But a private company would be up against some of the largest companies in the world, like Apple.        
Even before Friday, many analysts had declared BlackBerry’s hardware business to be worthless. There is no clear consensus, however, on the value of its other assets.        
BlackBerry owns a secure global network that once provided it with a selling point for customers seeking security. But that highly centralized network is prone to occasional failures, is based on aging technology and has had its role reduced under BlackBerry 10.        
The value of the company’s patents, many of which it holds in partnerships with other technology companies, is also uncertain. The layoffs also suggest that BlackBerry will be forced to give up most of its research and development work, further clouding its value.        
“The biggest problem is that they won’t have money for R.&D. and that’s death for a tech company,” said Neeraj Monga an analyst at Veritas Investment Research in Toronto. “It’s not like Coca-Cola, which has been able to bottle the same formula for over 100 years.”

Styles,"










I WAS WALKING ALONG a twilit Hudson River the other night, distracted by how gobs of blackened chewing gum can make a sidewalk look leopard-spotted, when an even more vivid sight caught my eye. I saw a flutter of excitement ripple through a row of 15 or so people sitting on park benches along the water. The flutter was like a seated, nonstadium version of the “Wave,” and led to isolated pockets of chittering and simulations of postcoital languor.        


Had a squirrel’s tail just tickled a long row of human bottoms? “What just happened?” I asked a park bench sitter in her 20s. She reported, “Hugh Jackman just walked by!” Sans sunglasses or hat. I expressed enthusiasm and asked if she had “waved or said hello.” She told me: “No. I was cool.”        
Which is how we all try to be in the presence of the famous, no? But sometimes we’re unwilling or unable to curb our lesser instincts — we want to parse or mediate an entity that is at once wholly familiar but wholly unknown to us; we want to touch the proverbial screen. Is this bad manners? We’re told as children, “Don’t stare,” but every celebrity seems to wear a placard around his neck that screams, “Please do.”        
One day about 11 years ago, the personal trainer and entrepreneur Dièry Prudent was sitting in the Air France lounge at Charles de Gaulle airport with his 3-year-old daughter when Cicely Tyson entered. “I told myself, ‘Don’t stare,’ ” Mr. Prudent said. Miss Tyson made no eye contact, “but after a few minutes of watching my daughter play patty-cake with Daddums, she cracked a smile. I knew that smile. I’ve seen ‘Sounder’ and ‘The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.’ I cry every time.”        
Mr. Prudent leaned toward Miss Tyson and whispered, “Excuse me, but are you Cicely Tyson?” Miss Tyson gave Mr. Prudent a gaze “that could sear beef. Then she responded with a question: ‘Why?’ Before I could even think of what to say, out it came: ‘Why not?’ ”        
Cough, cough. Crickets. A German shepherd chained to a fence, plaintively barking.        
Fortunately, Miss Tyson chuckled. “I blushed and we both quickly went back to minding our business,” Mr. Prudent said.        
Incidents in which a nonfamous person has grounds for interacting with a famous person can also be fraught. Matthew Tynan, an associate at the law firm Pelosi Wolf Effron & Spates, recounted how a dinner party in the early ’90s held by his mother, Kathleen Tynan — a writer who had been married to the critic Kenneth Tynan — drew the director Jonathan Miller, the actor Dirk Bogarde and Princess Margaret. Matthew Tynan said, “P. M. clearly enjoyed slumming it with her intellectual friends, but I imagine that the trip down our rusty stairs, past the dustbins, to our basement flat was a new low.”        
Pressed into service as coat check, bus boy and waiter, the teenage Mr. Tynan was reminded by his mother to bow to the princess and call her ma’am. “At one point I found myself serving a fish course to P. M., and as I lowered the dish in front of her, she abruptly raised her hand, arresting mine mid-motion. All conversation immediately stopped. Without looking up, she barked, ‘Wrong side!’ ” As everyone watched, I made a muffled apology, picked up her poached salmon, raised it over her head (resisting the urge to deposit it there) and gently sat it down on the ‘right’ side.”        
Mortified, Mr. Tynan slunk back to the kitchen. But when it came time to clear the fish course, “I noticed, with smug satisfaction, that P. M. had not used the ‘correct’ knife, and I couldn’t resist mumbling something pathetic along the lines of ‘Was there a problem with the fish knife, ma’am?’ If she heard me, she made no sign of it, and completely ignored my presence — a skill that she had surely honed after many years of interacting with the servant class.”        
It’s probably not worthwhile to generalize as to how famous people want us to behave around them. While certain comments commonly and unmaliciously directed at the illustrious are often construed by their audience as hurtful — e.g., “I’ve been a fan of yours since I was a tiny child,” “I think I just read something of yours!”— many other comments fall under the gauzy heading “Depends on Situation.” Tom Waits might or might not be amused to be told that his voice is indistinguishable from Cookie Monster’s; the singer and actress Connie Stevens might or might not want to know that you and your Facebook friends larkily refer to asterisks as “emoticonnies.” But maybe not. The desire, when in the presence of the famous, to separate yourself from the herd by saying something memorable to them is a dangerous one. As someone who once told Tina Fey, “I have a big gay crush on you,” I can attest that the anxiety about a celebrity’s response to a provocative comment is not worth the ground gained by uttering same provocative comment. (That said, Miss Fey seemed flattered.)

Presidents Kennedy, Nixon and Clinton walked into a bar. This is no joke. The bar is Martin’s Tavern in Washington, and it serves an above-average pot roast.        


This isn’t the only bar patronized by American presidents, of course. Curious about others, we visited more than a dozen East Coast places that lay claim to a presidential past. Half history lesson, half goose chase, our journey took us to a number of joints that walk a fine line between celebrating their past and wearing presidential celebrity on their sleeve — and those that achieve that balance deserve a visit.        
MARTIN’S TAVERN Serving first families and everyday Georgetown denizens since 1933, Martin’s boasts visits by every United States president since Harry S. Truman, except for the nation’s current one, all before they were commander in chief.        
Mismatched Tiffany-style lamps hang above an original mahogany bar. Weathered wooden booths envelop patrons dining on President Richard M. Nixon’s favored meatloaf or President Truman’s preferred pot roast. For a uniquely Martin’s experience, visitors can sit in the Rumble Seat, the one-seated, one-sided booth No. 11, where President John F. Kennedy regularly took breakfast and read the paper while in Congress. The Proposal Booth, booth No. 3, is curiously one of two tables we encountered on our trip that is named as the site of Kennedy’s engagement to Jacqueline Bouvier. “We’re not going to say it didn’t not happen here,” was the fourth-generation owner Billy A. Martin Jr.’s circuitous account of the proposal.        
If the dining room is packed, retreat to the “dugout room,” a cozy cavern where President Lyndon B. Johnson sipped his favorite cocktail, Scotch and soda, while conspiring alongside House Speaker Sam Rayburn in booth No. 24. Today, Martin’s seats fewer politicians. But that didn’t stop Mr. Martin from urging Teresa Heinz Kerry to bring in her husband, Secretary of State John Kerry, for a taste of tradition leading up to the 2004 presidential election.        
“It has always been good luck,” Mr. Martin said. As for Mr. Kerry, he never did make it.

THE TOMBS Not far from Martin’s is this discreet Georgetown cellar, where President Bill Clinton, as a Georgetown undergraduate, joined classmates for beer and burgers, steps from his M Street dorm. In his autobiography, “My Life,” he identifies the Tombs, a bunker of a bar beneath Georgetown’s swanky 1789 restaurant, as a former haunt. Pitchers hang above a large square bar, awaiting refill from a bow-tie-clad, student-aged staff. Barside engravings pay homage to a lineage of barkeeps. President Clinton would no doubt approve of the current scene, where a good meal can still be had for under $15, and Georgetown students continue to take refuge from the city above.

OFF THE RECORD AT THE HAY-ADAMS Overlooking 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the 144-room Hay-Adams hotel was the home of President Obama and his family in the weeks before he took office and may be the closest most people can get to sleeping in the White House. However, in a quiet basement lounge, visitors might find a future leader of the free world just trying to unwind. The bar is Off the Record, and John Boswell, a veteran bartender there, has served every president since Gerald R. Ford, before or after they became president. Its crimson, button-backed benches tuck into the walls to afford clientele sanctuary in which, as the bar’s Web site puts it, they can “be seen and not heard.” 
Mr. Boswell, the affable and tight-lipped weeknight bartender, would reveal not a single utterance he’s heard in 16 years at the bar. He wouldn’t even say how many presidents he’s served in the bar itself versus the hotel at large. But Mr. Boswell did offer some reminiscences. He recalled the “sweet” sight of George H. W. Bush and his son, then the governor of Texas, at the bar, going largely unnoticed. President Clinton would duck in between fund-raisers at the hotel above, Mr. Boswell recalled, sipping sauvignon blanc barside. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was said to be a more frequent visitor when she was serving in the Senate, but you didn’t hear it from him.        
Amid the dark red walls, political caricatures and low lighting that have kept this bar’s White House crowd shrouded in mystery, finish the day with an apropos Presidential — a vodka martini with blue-cheese olives. “We like to stick to the classics,” Mr. Boswell said. “John McCain doesn’t want a razzle-dazzle martini.”

IRELAND’S OWN PUB A short ride outside Washington, in Alexandria, Va., is Ireland’s Own, an Irish pub where, in Smithsonian fashion, the former owner Pat Troy created Reagan’s Corner — a reverent tribute to President Ronald Reagan’s surprise St. Patrick’s Day visit in 1988. Ireland’s Own displays photographs of that spontaneous visit, now also memorialized on YouTube. Mr. Troy sold the restaurant in 2012, but the artifacts remain. Reagan’s table setting from that day is encased in glass, complete with autographed meal ticket and the silverware used on that day.

“21” CLUB As you pass the wrought-iron gates, don’t let the jockeys deter you: New York’s “21” is not a private club. The Bar Room of this former speakeasy, with its hallmark red-and-white checkered tablecloths and a toy-filled ceiling (including a model PT-109 contributed by President Kennedy), has a register that reads like an eighth-grade history book. Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, save our current one, has been to “21.”

Grant did. The Willard InterContinental is on the site of the original Willard Hotel visited by Grant, but the current building was erected in 1901; it is not the case that you can have a drink in the same lobby where Grant had one. In addition, the article referred incorrectly to Dorchester in Massachusetts where the Eire Pub is located. Dorchester is a Boston neighborhood; it is not a city “just outside Boston.”



"
Culture,"










For the second year in a row, New York City Ballet has allied with high fashion for its fall gala. Last time, the costume designs were by Valentino, and the reviews of the event mostly described it as an artistic fiasco or insignificant. (I missed it.) By those standards, this recent program, at the David H. Koch Theater on Thursday, was a vast improvement. Only one part of the evening was apt to give you bad dreams.        


In between a John Adams orchestral fanfare and the finale of Balanchine’s “Western Symphony” came three world premieres, each with a different pairing of choreographer and fashion designer. Before each piece, a video peeked at the collaborative process. Such videos often feel superfluous or pandering, but these were charming, finding good humor in the conflicts between fashion and choreography. Marc Happel, the director of City Ballet’s costume shop, came off as a hero, a man you would want by your side in the artistic trenches.        
First was “Capricious Maneuvers,” by Justin Peck, the City Ballet soloist who has emerged in the last two years as its most exciting choreographer. The costumes, by Prabal Gurung, were respectful: for the three women, short dresses in white, black and red that moved well and added color and flair. The work, set to Lukas Foss’s “Capriccio,” was only eight minutes long, but it packed in plenty.        
This is Mr. Peck’s fourth piece for the company, and though the influences of other choreographers are patent, you wouldn’t mistake his work for anyone else’s. “Capricious Maneuvers” is a tightly constructed garment — nothing capricious about it — and yet it breathes freely. The title of the Adams orchestral fanfare — “Short Ride in a Fast Machine” — could have applied to it.        
Two men join the three women, and Mr. Peck shuffles two against three with great dexterity. The dancers are pattern makers, but they are also young people, drawn together in fellowship. It’s characteristic of Mr. Peck that the women are happily slid under the onstage piano, and characteristic that that motif is varied to comically surprising effect. He pulls a thrilling recklessness out of his cast. Andrew Veyette’s abandon has rarely seemed so dashing. Brittany Pollack, in a breakout performance, justified her red dress.        
Next came “Neverwhere,” by Benjamin Millepied, the former City Ballet principal recently named the director of the Paris Opera Ballet. The costumes, by Iris Van Herpen, are more attention-grabbing, made of scales of black plastic that sparkled in the light. The women’s point shoes are also boots, a novel and provocative crossing of two kinds of female footwear with different associations of power.        
Though crinkly, the costumes work fine, and Mr. Millepied’s dance for three couples attends closely to its score, “Drones and Viola,” by his frequent collaborator Nico Muhly. Though both the music and the dance are broken into sections — silences met with blackouts — it’s in fluency that choreographer and composer are well matched. Particularly in a late, tender duet for Sterling Hyltin and Tyler Angle, the endless thread typical of Mr. Millepied’s partnering floats on Mr. Muhly’s drone.        
Between the costumes and the pyramid cut out of the backdrop and the dancers gathering into inward-facing circles, “Neverwhere” is something of an alien rite. But its sci-fi sheen doesn’t make it ridiculous, especially not in comparison with the evening’s final premiere.        
“Spectral Evidence,” by the veteran French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, had two sources of inspiration: the Salem witch trials and recordings of vocal music by John Cage. Olivier Theyskens has costumed the piece’s four men in dark suits and clerical collars. The four women wear white dresses, each with a different patch of red silicon. The patches are distracting — one resembles a baboon’s buttocks — and not as meaningful as scarlet letters in a work where all the women are witches.        
The action begins promisingly enough, with men of the cloth seated on slabs. The four witches materialize from behind, covering the men’s eyes and manipulating the men’s bodies. Amar Ramasar and Robert Fairchild do a severe, puritanical dance to liturgical-sounding chant. Then Mr. Fairchild, precise and forceful throughout, smites the air with a two-handed karate chop. The slabs break into ramps, and the work starts to go downhill.        
Mr. Preljocaj’s choreography for these witches, who just want to be loved, and these hypocritical men, who find them tempting but sinful, has some drive and snap. (Tiler Peck, as usual, made the most of it.) But as the work continues, it comes to resemble a supernatural creature that just won’t die. The lapses in taste get worse and worse, and the literal reductions of the breath noises and sound effects in the Cage compositions hit a nadir with poor Mr. Fairchild’s acting possessed while lip-syncing.        
“It’s strange, no?” the recorded voice he mouths asks in French. Yes, and not in a good sense. At best, City Ballet has acquired a Halloween dance. Too bad the fall season runs only until Oct. 13. That still gives you five more chances to see “Spectral Evidence.” Mr. Peck’s and Mr. Millepied’s works, which have more than car crash appeal, aren’t on the schedule. Is poor planning to blame? Fashion? Witchcraft?        



 
New York City Ballet’s fall season continues through Oct. 13 at the David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 496-0600, nycballet.com.

You know you’re in for something good when a man with a tiny plastic spoon asks conspiratorially: “Have you tried the cherries jubilee? It’s what got me into the biz.”        


Alotta Gelato is a typical small-town ice cream shop: rumbling freezer compressor, giddy barefoot kids, board games stacked in a corner. But its product is on a higher level, made from ingredients like sweet-tart Italian amarena cherries. It’s just one reason I love Silver City, a town of about 10,000 in southwestern New Mexico.        
Silver, as it’s known, has recently become a road-trip destination among those willing to drive for a good meal. But it’s no overnight sensation. Alotta Gelato’s Mitchell Hellman, the man with the spoon, celebrated the store’s 10-year anniversary last month, and a couple of other great restaurants have been around just as long.        
Silver began as a mining town in 1870, hippies came a century later, and newer artists have since arrived and added their own flourishes, like candy-colored paint jobs on the stately cast-iron facades downtown. The food scene is an extension of this creativity, and it prizes local ingredients — farmers’ market tomatoes can sell out in 35 minutes — as well as excellent imported ones like Mr. Hellman’s cherries. This isn’t because it’s trendy, but because Silver City’s isolation — the town backs up against the 2.7-million-acre Gila National Forest, and it’s 45 miles to an Interstate — inspires chefs to build their own world.        
As a guidebook author, I had been to Silver several times, but was always too rushed to savor the place. Last spring, over the course of four days, my mother, Beverly McFarland, and I ate our way around town and checked up on some new developments. Chief among those is the Murray Hotel, which reopened last summer after being boarded up for more than 20 years. In 1938, the hotel signaled modernity with its solid concrete architecture, glass bricks and porthole windows. Now the front doors were open to the street, and the black terrazzo lobby floor gleamed as if it was laid yesterday.        
“Oh, you have my favorite room!” the desk clerk exclaimed as she handed over our key cards. From our window on the fourth floor, I could see the place we’d be having dinner, and I briefly worried that I had planned too much eating and not enough exercise. Downtown Silver City is only about half a mile long.        
Jake Politte opens his restaurant, 1zero6, three nights a week. Savvy regulars know to check the short but intense menu online Thursday morning, then call to put dibs on entrees like pork loin bathed in bitter chocolate, Mexican chiles and Thai fish sauce. We tucked into crispy-custardy Cambodian mini-pancakes and “Sichuan ravioli” — gingery dumplings in a chunky tomato sauce. Mr. Politte’s eclectic culinary taste is echoed in the restaurant’s décor, in which a billboard-size Bollywood poster faces an Indonesian wood skeleton.        
As we finished a fruit tart lined with a slick of bitter chocolate, Mr. Politte, tattoos swirling down his arms, came out to relight the candles on his Buddhist shrine. He told us how he’d arrived in Silver from the Bay Area a decade earlier. He’d been looking for a remnant of the New Mexico he’d known in Santa Fe after high school, in the early 1970s, “back when it was just cowboys and Indians and hippies.” Mr. Politte found a little of that rough-around-the-edges atmosphere here.        
He relishes introducing customers to new flavors — fresh banana blossoms, say, which he scored from a grocer in Tucson. Or chapulines (grasshoppers), brought to him by a customer from Oaxaca. “People say, ‘Whoa, that’s scary,’ ” he related with glee, “and I say, ‘No, man, it’s food.’ ”        
The next day, we walked the trails on Boston Hill in town, starting behind old cottages and winding up past the long-abandoned silver mines that gave the city its name. In the wilderness at the top, we rested on an incongruous turquoise blue bench. Below us, Silver’s core looked tidy and timeless. The town founders were determined to make a lasting place, unlike other slapdash mining camps. So up rose grand limestone, brick and cast-iron edifices. They weathered the crash of the silver market, two flash floods and the collapse of downtown commerce that beset so many small American towns. Now that sturdy shell fosters creativity — including our next meals.

In the event of a traffic accident, a dashboard video recorder could save you a hefty repair bill — provided you’re not at fault.         
But is it legal to record others on the road? Legal experts say that in general it is legal. The exceptions have arisen in fewer than a half-dozen states that have sought to restrict recording by drivers, particularly in situations involving police actions.        
“That’s been the flash point for controversy,” said Howard M. Wasserman, a professor of law at Florida International University in Miami. Such laws have been based on eavesdropping legislation that requires the permission of both parties for a recording to be made, he explained.        
While such laws have not generally withstood challenges, some police officers still take recording by private citizens — a traffic stop, for instance — to be hostile, said Franklin E. Zimring, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “But in public spaces, photographic recording is no longer the exception, it’s the rule,” he said. “So as recording becomes the new normal, objections tend to dissolve.” JOHN R.

People describe Erika Halweil, a longtime yoga teacher in the Hamptons, as someone who has a lot of backbone in every way. She has great posture. She rarely gets upset over things like parking tickets or bad-hair days. (Naturally pretty, she probably doesn’t have many.) She is sometimes stern but never shy.        


“Erika is exuberant and totally at ease with her exuberance,”  Brian Halweil, her brother, wrote in an e-mail. “If I were to bump into a celebrity at a party, I would probably clam up and try to think of something interesting to say. Erika would greet the person with a huge smile and loud hello and probably hug them.”        
Ms. Halweil, 36, grew up in New York in a tightknit family of four who loved to spend weekends together foraging for elderberries in Central Park, watching old Laurel and Hardy movies or surf-casting on Long Island. She always hoped she would replicate that kind of happy family unit in her own life. Instead, in 2008, she found herself living in Sag Harbor, N.Y., with a young daughter, Milla, an unhappy marriage and a huge mortgage she and her husband could not afford. “Broken marriage, broken house,” she said.        
While her marriage —and also her yoga practice — were foundering, she began regularly running into Corey De Rosa, an intense, thoughtful yoga teacher in Sag Harbor. “I was bumping into him three or four times a week, randomly, outside the post office, on a bench on Main Street,” she said. “He was so inspired and I was pathless.”         
Mr. De Rosa, now 40, grew up in a big Italian family in Hempstead, N.Y., played soccer and studied art at the State University at Stony Brook, then spent years in Manhattan working in restaurants and partying. In 2003, while living in a loft in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, he started biking across the Williamsburg Bridge every morning to practice Ashtanga yoga with Eddie Stern, a well-known teacher in SoHo. “I needed to transition from my party life into my balanced life,” he said. “It takes a long time. It’s not easy.”        
Three years later, he opened his own Ashtanga studio, Tapovana, in Sag Harbor. He painted the walls dark red, installed almost-black wood floors and put yellow candles everywhere. “It was like a womb,” he said. “It took you somewhere else.”         
At first, he was terrified, not at all sure he wanted the responsibility of owning a business. “You always need to go a little further than you think you can in order to make progress,” said Mr. De Rosa, who in a single conversation might discuss Hindu deities, the connection between the knees and the ego, an energy healer he admires, Indian spices, juice cleanses and his ideas about love (timing is everything).        
On Aug. 17, 2008, Ms. Halweil was driving on Montauk Highway when a 5-year-old girl rode a red toy wagon down a steep driveway and shot out onto the road in front of Ms. Halweil’s car. When she recounts the accident (the child died and Ms. Halweil was not charged) you can really see her calm, philosophical and open demeanor. In an almost plaintive voice, she said: “It was clear sky, clear road. I saw a flash of red coming toward my car.” She swerved but still hit the wagon. “I got out of the car and this really beautiful little girl with pale skin and blue eyes was laying in the road. Her eyes were glazed over. I knew the spirit had left her body.”        
Today, she says the accident taught her about fate, her own and the girl’s, but at the time she was devastated. She started taking daily classes at Tapovana and finding comfort in Ashtanga’s rigorous, some say purifying, series of poses that are practiced in silence. Sometimes, she stayed after class to discuss meditation techniques or the yogic perspective on suffering with Mr. De Rosa. He said he found her “amazingly beautiful and radiating,” but because he had a longtime girlfriend at the time, he said he felt bound to resist falling for Ms. Halweil.        
“I was really looking for things to not be interested in,” he said. “She reminded me of my mother, her intelligence and wit and the fact that she loves to sing.”

For many cyclists, riding a bike is a kind of heaven. You’re simply a body breathing clean air and having very few thoughts. That’s the meditative side. It does not hurt that the sport is kind to the knees. That’s the non-load-bearing, exertive side. Then there are the fans who like to mosey, the leisurely bike riders. No spandex or clocking speed for them. They don’t pay attention to the miles. It’s just the wind in their faces, and the tranquillity and peace that they feel. With the advent of fall, three writers tell us about their favorite bike journeys, from a beloved route along rolling fields and Lake Champlain in Vermont and upstate New York to a ride in the wild green countryside of western Ireland and a night ride in Paris.        


‘Road Closed’? Not to Me. 
A “Road Closed” sign is always a gamble on a bike ride. Ignore it and be rewarded with miles of tranquil, car-free riding. Usually the road damage is passable on a bike. Then there are the days when a dead end forces a retreat and a detour.        
That was the choice we confronted in the lush foothills of the Adirondacks in New York. The sign blocked a scenic alternative to miles of riding on the shoulder of State Highway 22. Beyond it, a smooth dirt road passed beneath a ceiling of maple and hemlock branches that tinted the summer light green. After a brief consultation with my friend and riding partner, Sean Luitjens, we wheeled around the sign.        
“I hope we don’t regret this,” I said.        
Even without this hiccup, our trip around the midsection of Lake Champlain, which separates Vermont from New York, involved more logistical wizardry than usual. It would take three ferry rides to complete the seven-hour, 78-mile loop that began at my house in the college town of Burlington, Vt.        
We started the ride cycling south, past suburban housing tracts into hills carpeted with hayfields, punctuated by the occasional McMansion and Vermont clapboard farmhouse. A swoop down to Lake Champlain and across the wooden slats of an 1870s-era covered bridge brought us to a ferry connecting quaint Charlotte, Vt., to the little lakefront town of Essex, N.Y.        
A few miles north of Essex, Highway 22 kicked up for three strenuous miles. As it flattened, we came to Highland Road and that “closed” sign.        Stewart Cairns for The New York TimesBicycles at rest on a trail near Burlington, Vt. "

Jillian Sanders frequently visits the Facebook page of a high-school classmate she hasn’t talked to in years. But these drop-ins, more like recon missions, are not entirely pleasant.        


“I don’t know why it infuriates me,” said Ms. Sanders, 31, a freelance book publicist. “She’ll often describe, say, how her favorite ice cream flavor makes her happy all day. I feel like she’s lying. I get upset watching people post pictures of a rainbow that says ‘I believe in magic’ — upset that they’re projecting that image and thinking others are falling for it, or that they’re falling for it themselves. Maybe I’m just jealous.”        
Zeke Farrow, 38, can identify with the impulse. He sometimes virtually checks in on a friend with whom he had an acrimonious falling-out years ago. “I don’t know why else I’d go to his page except the hope that I’ll see something bad or narcissistic,” said Mr. Farrow, a screenwriter based in Los Angeles. “I want to see him prove his own behavior, because he can’t help it. So if you’re already expecting it before you go to their page, it’s a joyous confirmation.”        
The New York author David Goodwillie, 41, spreads out his joyous confirmations among a varied ensemble. “There are more than a dozen people I would and should block on Facebook,” he said. “But I’m so astounded and enthralled by their constant posting that I stay friends with them just to see if they’re going to post for the 12th time this week about their book or their baby.”        
These individuals are hate-reading (much as you may be doing right now, with this very article). Hate-reading, usually of social media, provides satisfaction from fury-fueled engagement with someone who should theoretically not provide it.        
Our motives rarely come from a position of strength, as Katie J. M. Baker, a writer for Jezebel, described in her exploration of hate-reading the Internet. “I usually hate-read alone, late at night when I’m procrastinating, drunk, bored or all three,” she wrote. “When I finally walk away from my computer, I feel like I’ve just binged on a butter-sogged bag of popcorn before the movie even started: I’m slightly nauseated, but still can’t help licking my fingers for more fatty flavor.”        
Ms. Baker concluded her essay with a vow to go “cold turkey,” as “hate-reading satisfies my negative energy, but it leaves me with little more than a false sense of both security and productivity.” Or, as she said in an interview (after acknowledging she wasn’t able to swear off the habit completely), “The practice became way less satisfying after I realized that I was hate-reading to feel superior to other people.”        
Her self-assessment may be a more enlightened version of the findings from Alexander H. Jordan, an adjunct assistant professor of business administration at Dartmouth. In a Stanford study suggesting we underestimate negative emotion in others’ lives (a misjudgment exacerbated by the cheery cast of most social-media personae), he and his co-authors wrote, “Some research suggests that downward emotional comparisons can improve people’s well-being.”        
“It’s when a person’s typically rosy self-view is temporarily threatened that self-enhancement processes, such as finding people to ‘hate’ online, are triggered,” Professor Jordan said in an interview. “Research has also shown that people who are chronically unhappy or low in self-esteem are more concerned about social comparisons, upward or downward, in general.”        
So, a common way to boost one’s ego through “emotion-regulation strategy,” he said, “is to look down on other people, such as reading a dumb blog to feel smarter or looking at photos to feel more stylish or a drama-filled Facebook page that might make you feel you’re well adjusted.”        
It’s not schadenfreude, he noted; it’s more akin to gloating.        
Worse, these sad, insecure people (in other words, most of humanity, at one time or another) descend into “unhealthy feedback loops,” he said. “People look around at others’ ‘perfect lives’ on Facebook, feel bad about themselves, boost their self-regard by putting out their own ‘perfect lives’ and/or hate-reading others’ pages, and then their ‘perfect lives’ make others feel bad about their own lives in turn.”

Cyrus Hakakian has a soft spot for ’80s rock.        


“Journey, the Eagles — I love those bands. I’d love to get them here,” he said in an interview recently. “Here” is the Space at Westbury, the renovated former Westbury Theater, which will open Oct. 4. Mr. Hakakian, 52, of Roslyn, bought the old movie house, situated on a nondescript stretch of Post Avenue across from a Dunkin’ Donuts, in 2004 with his three brothers; they have since spent $10 million readying it for concerts and other performances, including theater and dance.        
And though Mr. Hakakian is pleased with the initial lineup — which includes the pop groups Fountains of Wayne and Soul Asylum along with the Lemonheads’ Evan Dando on opening night, the comedian Stephen Lynch on Oct. 11 and the singer Rickie Lee Jones on Oct. 16 — he hopes his ’80s-era heroes find their way to Westbury eventually.        
“I’ve got a big wish list, and they’re on it,” he said.        
The opening of the 25,000-square-foot theater, which can accommodate 817 people seated or 1,500 for general admission shows, is “tremendously important for the village,” Mayor Peter I. Cavallaro said in a phone interview.        
“In Nassau County I can’t think of another theater of this size and type in a small downtown like we have,” he added. “The theater brings a whole new element” to Westbury.        
The former Westbury Theater, a Tudor-style structure built in the 1920s, may be unrecognizable to those who knew it as the local movie house that showed art films in the 1980s and 1990s, when Corinne Straehle, 88, of Garden City, owned it with her husband, Roland. It is now outfitted with opulent touches including plush velvet removable seating and massive, sparkling chandeliers. Six sleek bars, one 30 feet long and made from wood salvaged during demolition, are scattered throughout.        
Panels of exposed original brick in both the lobby and the theater abut modern black walls. Floors in the lobby are Italian ceramic tile, and the dramatic stairway leading from there to the theater is a reproduction of the original, with original steel scrollwork railings. Three dressing rooms with private baths and a sprawling greenroom are tucked behind the stage; lighting and sound systems are “state of the art,” Mr. Bruce said, as he and the executive director, Bruce Michael, led a reporter on a tour recently. There are plans for up to 100 concerts in the first year of operation, Mr. Michael said, “plus many special events.”        
The building’s Tudor exterior has been replaced by a new, contemporary facade as well as an attention-grabbing LED marquee. The architects were Hoffman Grayson of Huntington.        
The theater, built for vaudeville and movies, opened in 1927 with the silent film “Hula,” starring Clara Bow and accompanied by a band from the University of Maryland. But by the time the Straehles lost the theater to bankruptcy in 2003, it had fallen into disrepair.        
“There was a huge hole in the roof and a foot of water on the ground. There were no lights. I had to walk through with a flashlight,” said Mr. Hakakian, referring to the initial tour of the building he took in 2004. The owner of Cyrus Knits, a women’s clothing company in Manhattan, he discovered the property through an auction ad in a newspaper.        
“There was graffiti all over the place,” and homeless people were living under the 45-foot-high stage, he said. Still, he fell in love: “I’ve always said this place has great structure. All it needed was a little meat on the bones.”        
Lowe Properties L.L.C., the Westbury real estate development company he formed with his brothers, Solomon, Stephen and David Hakakian, all of Long Island, to buy the building, acquired the theater for about $1.7 million. After a period of planning, including working out a parking deal with the town, gutting and renovation ensued, with most of the construction taking place in the last two years. In all, the Space has access to five parking lots downtown — all municipal lots, two leased exclusively to the theater — for a total of roughly 1,000 parking spots.        
Mr. Hakakian has also renovated four upstairs apartments and two nontheater businesses, a lounge and a cafe, that will flank the lobby of the Space. Both will be open later this fall.        
“People can just drop in,” Mr. Hakakian said. “We plan on this being a 365-days-a-year place for people to come.”        
To that end, Mr. Michael has been fielding requests from residents considering the Space for galas, bat and bar mitzvahs and other private events; there is a kitchen for catering. He is also hearing from local arts groups interested in collaborating with the theater.        
“A lot of organizations in the community and different parts of Long Island want to get involved, and we’re definitely interested in working with them,” said Mr. Michael, 66, of Manhattan and Southampton. But the theater, whose concerts are being booked through the Bowery Presents, will be selective about its programming, he said.        
“If we present something that’s already been done on Long Island, we’ll want to do it in a unique way,” Mr. Michael said.

Dining,"










What is it about a breaded and fried slice of meat that is so cross-culturally endearing? Call it a cutlet, call it chicken-fried steak. Call it schnitzel or Milanesa or cotoletta alla Milanese; everybody loves it the world around. Use beef, veal or pork. Or use chicken or turkey. It’s all good.        


The technique is always the same: the meat is flattened by pounding, dipped in flour and beaten egg, then coated in bread crumbs and shallow-fried until golden and crisp.        
There are abundant regional variations, and I try to sample them wherever I go. Quality varies, but if you are a fan, it is hard to find a truly bad version. The point is, even a tough cut of meat, when prepared in this fashion, emerges from the pan succulent and tender.        
I’ve had genuine delicate Wiener schnitzel in Vienna, authentic big-as-a-plate Milanese cutlets in Milan and the well-loved Milanesa in Argentina, sometimes as a sandwich. I can’t resist even a so-so truck stop rendition of chicken-fried anything, country gravy and all. I have a fondness for my Israeli friend’s stellar chicken schnitzel rolled in cornflake crumbs. And a morsel or two of Japanese tonkatsu in a panko crust is always nice.        
Making this breaded marvel is easy at home. I cut thin slices from a pork loin and flatten them only a bit. Rather than fine dry crumbs, I prefer to make soft crumbs from a day-old French loaf, cubed and whirled in a food processor, which creates a coating with a little texture.        
Olive oil is my choice for frying; clarified butter or good lard is fine, too. Make sure the oil is hot, but not too hot, and don’t skimp. You need more than a film of oil in the pan to achieve the perfect color and crunch.        
Season your cutlets both before and after frying (it makes a difference) and serve them as soon as they are ready.        
I like to scatter a mixture of chopped parsley, lemon zest and capers over the top, along with a sprinkling of chopped egg. But a wedge of lemon is all the garnish a well-fried cutlet really needs. Don’t forget to administer a good squeeze of lemon juice just before digging in.

WASHINGTON — A senior Obama administration official said Friday that the United States was encouraged by the initial inventory that the Syrian government had submitted of its chemical weapons arsenal.        


“We were pleasantly surprised by the completeness of their declaration,” said the official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.        
“It was better than expected,” he added.        
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the watchdog group known as the O.P.C.W. that oversees the international agreement banning poison gas, said on Friday that Syria had provided “an initial declaration” of its chemical weapons program.        
The submission met the first deadline for Syrian compliance that was set down by the framework agreement that the United States and Russia concluded in Geneva last weekend.        
American, British, Chinese, French and Russian diplomats are debating the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution that would enforce the agreement. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday that it was essential for the Council to adopt the resolution next week.        
“It started coming in yesterday,” Michael Luhan, a spokesman for the O.P.C.W., said of the Syrian declaration. Mr. Luhan, who spoke in a telephone interview from The Hague, said that the organization’s technical experts were studying the declaration but would not give additional details.        
The declaration’s completeness is an early test of President Bashar al-Assad’s commitment to relinquish Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal.        
The United States and Russia agreed in Geneva that Syria has about 1,000 tons of precursor chemicals and chemical agents, including sulfur mustard and sarin gas.        
The fact that Russia, which has been one of the principal supporters of the Assad government, reached a consensus with the United States on the size of the arsenal after receiving an intelligence briefing by American experts suggested that the Syrian government would eventually declare a similar figure.        
Still, American officials had been waiting to see if the Syrian declaration would be submitted within a week of the framework agreement, as the accord requires, and whether it would be comprehensive.        
Under the framework agreement, the declaration is to detail types and quantities of all its chemical agents, munitions and precursor chemicals as well as all laboratories for developing the agents and facilities for producing weapons.        
Marie Harf, the deputy State Department spokeswoman, would not characterize the Syrian declaration, saying only that the United States will make “a careful and thorough review of the initial document.”        
The O.P.C.W. does not publicly disclose the contents of declarations. But its assessment of the accuracy and thoroughness of Syria’s statement will be crucial in determining how inspectors can best proceed with the agreement’s next stage, which includes far more formidable tests of the Assad government’s cooperation.        
By November, international monitors are to inspect all of Syria’s declared sites, and equipment to produce and mix chemical weapons is to be destroyed.        
Syria’s entire arsenal is to be eliminated by the middle of 2014, although Mr. Assad has said that process could take a year.        
Under the framework agreement, the United States and Russia are to outline procedures for quickly eliminating Syria’s chemical weapons program and verifying that the country is not hiding any weapons or stocks.        
An American and Russian draft outlining those procedures is subject to endorsement by the O.P.C.W. executive council, followed by codification in the Security Council resolution mandating elimination of Syria’s chemical arsenal.        
The executive council was to have met this weekend, but instead will likely convene toward the middle or end of next week, said Mr. Luhan, who gave no reason for the delay.        
The United States has identified at least 45 sites associated with Syria’s chemical weapons program and has suggested that half of them had “exploitable” quantities of chemical warfare materials, though American officials said Syrian forces had been moving stocks, so the locations could have changed.        
American officials said the sites where Syria’s chemical weapons and stocks are held are controlled by Mr. Assad’s government. While Russia has agreed with the estimate of the size of Syria’s arsenal, it has not endorsed the American list of the sites linked to the Syrian program.

WOLFEBORO, N.H. — When it came time to update its popular Odyssey minivan for 2014, Honda opted not to make a clean sweep: it just tidied up around the edges.        


Exterior changes to the fourth-generation van are so subtle they practically fall into the “if you say so” category, and the body sides retain a distinctive but polarizing character line that Honda calls the “lightning bolt.”        
While Honda has added some convenience features, it devoted much of its attention to improved crash safety. And, in keeping with the times, it has raised the fuel efficiency a bit on some versions.        
But the big attention-grabber is an addition that Honda claims to be an industry first, and one it is heavily promoting in its advertising and marketing of the new Odyssey: a built-in vacuum cleaner intended to appeal to parents of small children, pet owners and the terminally sloppy.        
Called the HondaVac, it was developed in conjunction with the Shop-Vac Corporation and is tucked into the left bulkhead of the rear cargo area. Its hose stretches — barely — to the farthest reaches of the interior.        
I tested the top-of-the-line EX-L Touring Elite, which for $45,280 included the HondaVac and just about everything else short of the kitchen sink. The base LX model starts at $29,655.        
My brother, visiting from Ohio, used the integrated vacuum to easily clean up dog hair. I stretched the hose to the front footwells to suck up some gravel tracked in from the driveway.        
Alhough Honda did not completely re-engineer the Odyssey, it made significant structural changes to enhance front-end crash protection. The Odyssey uses the second generation of Honda’s A.C.E. body structure (for Advanced Compatibility Engineering), which includes high-strength steel.        
Honda credits this reinforced structure for helping most of its new models get the top grade in the new, more stringent small-overlap crash test that the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety began conducting last year. The new Odyssey scored the highest rating, Good; because it also received Good ratings in the institute’s other crash tests, it received the highest overall designation, Top Safety Pick+.        
No other minivans have yet been subjected to the small-offset test.        
In another effort to improve passenger safety, Honda changed the design of the side curtain air bags so that they extend farther forward.        
(The 2014 model was not included in a recall last week of 318,000 Odysseys from the 2003-4 model years, as well as 2003 Acura MDXs, for air bags that could deploy without warning.)        
All models now have a rearview camera, and trim levels starting with the midlevel EX-L get forward-collision and lane-departure warning systems. These provide visual and audible alerts if sensors detect an impending crash or if the vehicle strays from its lane.        
Honda has also included blind-spot monitors. The Touring Elite that I tested flashes warnings on the housing of the side-view mirrors if a car is detected in the blind spots. Other trim levels get the Honda LaneWatch that first appeared on the Accord: it incorporates a tiny camera on the passenger-side mirror that displays a view down the van’s right side on the center dashboard screen.        
The engine is essentially the same as last year’s, a 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 248 horsepower. But all versions now come with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Previously, all but the top two trim lines had 5 speeds.        
The 2014 Odyssey is rated 19 m.p.g. in the city and 28 on the highway, up 1 m.p.g. in either driving mode over the old 5-speed. The Odyssey continues to have a mileage advantage over its main competitors, the Toyota Sienna (rated 18/25) and the Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan (17/25).        
My best real-world mileage in the 2014 Odyssey was 26.7 m.p.g. on a 214-mile round trip with just one passenger. My worst was 21 m.p.g. on a 180-mile round-trip from northern New Hampshire to this town on Lake Winnipesaukee with six people on board.        
Over all, the Odyssey works well as a family room on wheels. It is spacious and seats up to eight. Even adults as tall at 6-foot-4 can sit comfortably in the third row without making passengers in the second-row seats — which slide forward and back for legroom adjustments — suffer.        
The Odyssey is reasonably quiet on most road surfaces for such a big, boxy vehicle, and the ride is comfortable.        
My one gripe continues to be the steering. Heading into a turn is a good time for steering to have some weight and feel. But that’s precisely when the Odyssey’s steering feel seems to get lighter and gives up communicating anything to the driver.        
The navigation system had some quirks. If you decide to deviate from the mapped route, it does not give up and recalculate as quickly as some others do. And twice it told us that we had arrived several miles before our true destinations, one of which was a major hotel.        
In recent years, although the Odyssey has not been the No. 1 minivan in J. D. Power’s Initial Quality or Vehicle Dependability studies, it has come in second to various competitors. According to ALG, a company that estimates the future value of leased vehicles, the Odyssey is likely to retain more value after three years than any other minivan.        
Even though it has some minor flaws and the vacuum could be considered gimmicky, Honda is doing something right. Although the Sienna has a more powerful engine — and an all-wheel-drive option — and the Grand Caravan is less expensive, the Odyssey has been outselling its competition this year.        
With families continuing their exodus to crossovers from vans — LMC Automotive says the minivan share of the vehicle market has slipped to 3.4 percent this year, from 8.5 percent in 1995 — Honda is hoping a gee-whiz gimmick like the vacuum will generate some new customers.

When Family and Friends Visit 


Q. If I allow close family and friends visiting from abroad to stay with me in my apartment, can a co-op board say I am subletting? 
A. It depends on how closely related you are to your guests and how long they stay.        
“Most proprietary leases permit an apartment to be occupied by the shareholder and the shareholder’s family,” said Dennis H. Greenstein, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer.        
In many cases, he said, “family” is defined as a spouse, children or stepchildren, and immediate family members. If the “close family” the letter writer is referring to is not permitted by the proprietary lease, they would not be allowed to “occupy” the apartment.        
But Mr. Greenstein noted that proprietary leases generally permit overnight guests to stay in an apartment for up to 30 days, provided the shareholder is also present. “A friend will not qualify as a member of the letter writer’s family, but would be considered a guest,” he said.        
Mr. Greenstein added that if any payment is being given to the letter writer by the family member or friend, the co-op board would most likely consider the arrangement a sublet. He said that most leases give the board the right to grant or withhold consent to a sublet, for any reason or for no reason, and permitted subletting may be subject to any conditions the board imposes.        
Renewing After a Rent Increase 
Q. I didn’t renew my lease when it was up for renewal because I wanted to try and negotiate the proposed rent increase. The landlord has not gotten back to me, however, after repeated efforts to reach him. If I just sign the lease now to ensure they don’t try to evict me, do I have to pay the new rent starting at the date my old lease expired (which is also the effective date of the new lease) or starting the date on which I sign the new lease? 
A. “If the tenant signs and returns the lease now, he will be responsible for the higher rent going back to the commencement date of the lease,” said Samuel J. Himmelstein, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants.        
But Mr. Himmelstein said that because this appears to be a nonregulated tenancy, unless the landlord has already signed the lease, the lease will not become effective until it is countersigned by the landlord and returned to the tenant.        
If the landlord has accepted rent from the tenant subsequent to the termination of the last lease, a month-to-month tenancy has been created, he said. If that is the case and the landlord chooses not to sign the lease, he could start a holdover proceeding — basically, an eviction action — against the tenant, but only after serving the tenant with a 30-day termination notice. “In that proceeding, the court would have the discretion to give the tenant up to six months to relocate, conditioned upon payment of the market rent during that period,” Mr. Himmelstein said.        
Waiting for an Offering Plan 
Q. A good friend has an apartment under a market-rate lease in a building that is becoming a condominium. The lease was in effect when the owner’s conversion plan was accepted for filing by the state attorney general’s office. She has not received a copy of the offering plan. Her lease is up at the end of October, and the owner is offering to allow her to stay as a month-to-month tenant. She would like to look at the offering plan to determine whether she can afford to buy her apartment. What rights does she have? 
A. Sandor Krauss, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said that with noneviction-plan conversions — the most common form of conversion — state law gives existing tenants certain rights at the time that the conversion plan is accepted for filing by the attorney general’s office. Among them: the right to receive a copy of the offering plan; the exclusive right to buy the apartment for 90 days; the right to any “insider” discounts; and the right to decline the owner permission to “show” the apartment to potential buyers within the 90-day period.        
If a tenant does not buy the apartment during the 90 days, the sponsor must offer a new lease, not a month-to-month lease at a market-rate rent. Mr. Krauss said that if the sponsor has not complied with those rules, the tenant can file an action in the courts or with the attorney general’s office requiring the owner to do so.

The math-averse may not be drawn initially to “Proof,” the David Auburn play that is being presented by McCarter Theater Center in Princeton. It is, at least superficially, about advanced math and mathematicians.        


But Mr. Auburn’s four-character play, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 2001, is really more concerned with the value of trust in relationships than with proving some mind-boggling equation that changes the world’s understanding of the cosmos. And for all its emotional turmoil, the piece is agreeably streaked with humor. Think of it rather as a nice-geeks-in-love sort of scenario, and the work becomes more inviting.        
Set on the back porch of a house near the University of Chicago, the contemporary story centers on the 20-something Catherine, unsettled by the death of her father, Robert, a celebrated mathematician who became helplessly “bughouse,” as he put it, in his later years. Catherine relinquished her own academic studies in the field to care for Robert, and now, obviously, is at loose ends.        
Robert’s elder daughter, Claire, who arrives from New York for the funeral, fears that the sadly withdrawn Catherine may have inherited her father’s mental instability, as well as some of his genius, and urges her sister to return East with her for therapy.        
Hal, one of Robert’s former students, is a friendly stranger in the house who has been vainly sifting through scores of Robert’s scribbled notebooks to see whether the man conceived of anything significant during his lengthy illness.        
As the first act proceeds, a romance is kindled between Catherine and Hal. Their budding relationship breaks down, however, when Catherine shows Hal the contents of a notebook she says belongs to her. The disbelieving reactions of Claire and especially Hal shatter Catherine’s frail composure.        
Although the play’s eventual resolution may seem somewhat facile, what transpires before is a touching study in filial devotion, as brilliant people struggle against their fears of madness.        
Emily Mann, the McCarter’s artistic director, delivers a smart account of the play that looks and sounds wonderfully intimate within the center’s 360-seat Berlind Theater.        
Ms. Mann and her longtime collaborator Eugene Lee, the set designer, provide visual circumstances that seem equally natural and abstract. The Chicago back porch is framed against a vast blackboard scrawled with equations, theoretical notations and partial erasures in white chalk that suggest the enormous scale of Robert’s calculations. It also provides the appropriate environs for a drama in which the figure of Robert appears in the flesh during the flashback sequences, but also as a presence in his daughter’s mind.        
Persuasive acting under Ms. Mann’s sensitive guidance lends the play a sense of warm actuality.        
Often wrapped in a too-large cardigan that obviously belonged to her father — the insightful clothing design is by Jennifer von Mayrhauser — Catherine, as portrayed by Kristen Bush, is a spiky yet anxious individual. With her hair scraped back from a plain-pretty face sometimes dominated by black-rimmed glasses, Ms. Bush is believably either vibrant or desolate as Catherine contends none too successfully with her violently fluctuating emotions.        
A craggy Michael Siberry, resembling a white-haired Raymond Massey at certain angles, depicts the kindly Robert with expansive gestures and a resonant voice.        
Thanks to the chemistry shared by Mr. Siberry and Ms. Bush, the scenes in flashback between the father and his daughter are particularly poignant. Perhaps the production’s most moving moment occurs when Robert, seemingly lucid, proudly shows Catherine his outline for a new proof. As Catherine silently scans the notebook, with Robert beaming at her side, her eager face clouds and then falls when she realizes that her father’s mind has begun to fail him again. “Dad,” she says quietly, “Let’s go inside.” Ms. Bush communicates a great deal of heartbreak in those few words.        
Michael Braun’s gentle, scruffy Hal is a lovable fellow who is clearly taken with Catherine’s mind, and her other charms. Jessica Dickey gives an assured performance as the bossy but well-meaning Claire.        
Stephen Strawbridge, the lighting designer, artfully employs side lighting to give a sculptural quality to the actors. The complex sound design created by Mark Bennett musically percolates with woodwinds and strings as it punctuates the play’s moods, most notably with a sharp crack when Catherine makes a claim to greatness that concludes the first act so dramatically.

Runaway 18-wheelers, death-defying motorcyclists and vehicular acrobatics that seem to defy the laws of physics have become a staple of YouTube, in large part a result of the availability of dashboard video cameras. It’s all entertaining, but there are also practical reasons for recording while driving.        


The technology is readily available. Personal action video recorders are already popular among outdoor sports enthusiasts who attach cameras like the GoPro Hero3, starting around $200, to their helmets. Taxi fleet operators are using similar equipment to monitor their drivers and to act as an eyewitness when collisions occur.        
For consumers, an inexpensive model designed specifically for the family car is the Genius DVR-FHD590, about $120 online. The dashcam is about the size of an Oreo, so it can be installed on top of the dashboard without blocking the driver’s view. It records full HD video, has an LED for low-light situations and includes USB and HDMI ports for downloading and playback. It stores files on a microSD card; I installed an 8 GB card that cost $13.        
Compared with point-of-view sports camcorders like the GoPro models, the Genius is easier to set up — no squinting at endless menus required. It has a built-in 2.3-inch color display, so there’s no need to have a device like a smartphone to serve as a viewfinder, and it comes with a power adapter, windshield suction mount and a clip to attach it to a sun visor.        
Once plugged into a car’s 12-volt outlet, the Genius DVR-FHD590 automatically begins recording when the car is started and stops when the ignition is switched off. A built-in sensor will initiate emergency recording in the event of an accident, and the file remains stored until the owner deliberately deletes it.        
On several 200-mile excursions, I found the recorded video clear enough at night to see the vehicles traveling around me, although on a dark street it was still difficult to pick out a driver entering her double-parked car. Scenic country drives and urban highway routes were captured faithfully. The wide angle camera tends to capture a more inclusive vista than what drivers normally focus on, however; on the Interstate, the camera’s recording of passing trucks in narrow lanes looked more treacherous than it was in reality.        
While most drivers are unlikely to record a hot lap around a racetrack or witness a meteor strike while on the road, dashcams can be useful. I’ve been the victim of a hit-and-run by a New York taxi, which then ran a red light to escape, leaving an ugly yellow streak down the side of my vehicle. The driver’s dangerous getaway meant I missed catching the license plate number. A dashcam like the Genius might have saved the day.

Once marketed “for milady” and available only for passengers, vanity mirrors now come on both the left and right sunvisors of most vehicles sold in the United States. Among the 2,192 trim levels offered on 2013-model cars and trucks, dual visor mirrors are standard on 81 percent, according to Chrome Data Solutions, a Portland, Ore., company that provides vehicle descriptions for online shopping tools.        


But while many well-appointed Rams, Silverados and Jeeps provide bilateral vanity mirrors, 262 versions of new vehicles do not. They have one visor mirror, for the front-seat passenger.        
“That just seems crazy,” said David Gartman, a sociology professor at the University of South Alabama and author of “Auto Opium: A Social History of American Automobile Design” (Routledge, 1994). “It could just be dumb tradition. That’s where the vanity mirror has always been, because when couples ride together, the man has traditionally done the driving.”        
Automakers may assume that “since women stereotypically are the vain sex, they need the mirror where they sit, the passenger side,” he added.        
Even if women clamor louder than men for vanity mirrors — as one big automaker says they do — placing just one on the passenger’s side makes little sense, Dr. Gartman said, “since families now have a car for each adult in the household, which means women are probably driving themselves and their children.”        
For the first time, more women than men are in the driver’s seat, according to a study released last year by the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. In 2010, the report said, 105.7 million women were licensed to drive in the nation, compared with 104.3 million men, reversing a longtime gender gap.        
Yet some automakers aren’t catering to those women at the wheel. On the Nissan Versa sedan, a passenger-side vanity is optional on the SV version and standard on the SL, with no driver-side mirror available for either model. And for all Smart cars, a vanity is standard for the passenger but not even an option for the driver.        
“It certainly has nothing to do with gender roles,” John Curl, a regional product manager for Nissan, said of the Versa, about half of which are bought by women. “We had only enough money for one mirror, and we decided it should go on the passenger’s side,” he said, adding that “regardless of gender, the driver can use the rear-view mirror,” while a vanity mirror could be a “driver distraction.”        
“It would be exceedingly odd if you only had one to put it on the driver’s side,” he added. “I think you would get customer complaints.” But according to Chrome Data, versions of three 2013 vehicles — the Chevrolet Spark, Dodge Journey and Honda CR-Z — did just that.        
Dr. Gartman, the sociologist, said the boom in men’s cosmetics and plastic surgery suggested that “men are just as vain about their appearance as women.” But if vanity is gender-neutral, requests for vanity mirrors are not, said Justin Healy, the global overhead systems supervisor for engineering at Ford. He said that when Ford surveyed S.U.V. drivers in 2009 about their favorite visor feature, 54 percent of all respondents asked for a mirror. Among women, the figure was 70 percent.        
He said dual vanity mirrors were standard in 90 percent of Ford vehicles, the exceptions being commercial vehicles and entry-level cars. But in those with a solo mirror, why give it to the passenger?        
“We’re hedging our bets that the driver will use the rear-view mirror for a quick check,” Mr. Healy said. Or maybe not: Mary Sipes, vice president for global planning and program management at General Motors, looked into that in 2005, when she was a vehicle line director. She asked engineers to climb into an S.U.V. and check their teeth after eating broccoli. Pamela Flores, a G.M. spokeswoman, recalled that the men used the rear-view mirror; the women went for the vanity on the visor.

Three men convicted of murdering a Federal Express executive in 1995 have been free since January, when a judge in the Bronx ordered them released from prison after 
vacating their sentences. But it was not until Friday, when a prosecutor said her office would not seek to retry them in the case, that they learned that they were truly rid of the charge.        


The three, Devon Ayers, Michael Cosme and Carlos Perez, had been convicted of murdering the executive, Denise Raymond, in her apartment in the Soundview neighborhood. Along with two other people, the three were also convicted of killing a Senegalese cabdriver, Baithe Diop, days later in the same neighborhood.        
The convictions in the cabby’s killing fell apart in 2012 after an investigator for the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan revealed that two former gang members, who had become federal informants, had confessed to the crime. Because prosecutors had linked the two murders, the convictions in the Raymond case were also thrown into doubt.        
In January, at the request of prosecutors, Justice Denis J. Boyle of State Supreme Court in the Bronx vacated the convictions of Mr. Ayers, Mr. Cosme and Mr. Perez and ordered them released from prison without bail.        
But he also agreed to give prosecutors a chance to see if they could come up with new evidence for a second trial.        
On Friday, a prosecutor, Nicole Keary, said such evidence had not surfaced.        
“The district attorney’s office has determined that we will not prosecute the defendants for the murder of Denise Raymond,” she told Justice Patricia DiMango.        
Justice DiMango then dismissed the case and sealed the record, taking the last steps to end the three men’s involvement in the matter.        
Ms. Keary said investigators had looked at a bloodstain on a piece of glass that had been found in Mr. Cosme’s home, fingernail clippings from the body of Ms. Raymond, and handcuffs and duct tape that had been used to bind the victim before she was shot in the head.        
She said that the blood on the glass had come from a man, not Ms. Raymond, and that the fingernail clippings had not yielded a DNA match to the men.        
The duct tape, Ms. Keary said, contained so much of Ms. Raymond’s DNA that any other biological material would be masked.        
And three sets of handcuffs recovered from the crime scene were contaminated when a surge of water caused by Hurricane Sandy flooded into a storage facility.        
In addition, Ms. Keary said, one witness in the original trial had died and the testimony of a second had been “substantially compromised.”        
She told Justice DiMango that the decision to vacate the indictment did not mean the men were exonerated, but defense lawyers strenuously disagreed, with one describing the original case as “dubious from its inception.”        
As he left the courthouse, Mr. Cosme, 38, called the decision to vacate the indictment “a huge weight off my shoulders.”        
A few minutes later, Mr. Perez said he was grateful to the judge and to his lawyers. “I lost so much in those 18 years in prison for a homicide that I didn’t do,” he said. “I’m glad the truth came out.”

If Sammy Obeid has learned one thing from performing stand-up for 1,000 consecutive days, it’s to embrace his inner robot.        


Mr. Obeid, 29, who was to finish his Ironman project on Friday night, has long been a driven, goal-oriented perfectionist. He earned a 3.9 grade point average at the University of California, Berkeley, majoring in applied mathematics and business administration, before trying comedy, which he approached with the same rigor.        
“Jokes can be very systematic,” he said in an interview by Skype on Tuesday. “What is the right word that fits in this blank to make this equation work? How does its meaning evoke the best laugh?”        
His stand-up displays an analytic style full of wordplay, clever misdirection and ethnic humor riffing on his Middle Eastern roots (he’s Lebanese-American). In one of his characteristic jokes, he says: “I believe God is a woman. So I don’t say ‘Amen.’ I say, ‘That’s what she said.’ ”        
As soon as he started performing six years ago, Mr. Obeid meticulously tracked the success rate of each joke. Now he gives them grades (A, A +, A++, A+++) based on quantity of laughs, and has organized the jokes into lists.        
“This thing that I did is an example of who I am — a very mechanical, robotic person, I discovered that about myself,” Mr. Obeid said.        
Originally, he undertook the 1,000-day project to accelerate his evolution as a comic. He was inspired partly by the 10,000-hour rule popularized by the writer Malcolm Gladwell, which says that an extreme amount of practice is required to become exceptional in a cognitively demanding pursuit.        
Mr. Obeid said he had been performing every day for around a year when he heard of another comic, Hal Sparks, who had done so for two consecutive years. So Mr. Obeid became determined to break the record: he picked a round number, 1,000, and established rules. To qualify, he would need to tell jokes for a minimum of three minutes, and his set had to be presented as a comedy show.        
Reflecting on his accomplishment, Mr. Obeid sounded proud, if slightly weary. “I’ve been dying for this to be over for the last year,” he said.        
His streak may be unprecedented, but Mr. Obeid is still one of many comics who perform nightly, in multiple shows. The feat also raises a question often discussed in stand-up circles: how long does it take to master the art?        
Natural talent varies — and there are very funny young comics today, like Michael Che, who have had a lot of success in a short time — but the virtue of paying your dues is not only deeply ingrained, but it is also often talked about with great specificity in comedy. Mr. Gladwell focused on hours, but comedians are more likely to talk in years.        
In his address at the Just for Laughs festival this year, Colin Quinn said it took 10 years just to know if you were good. In an e-mail, the comic Amy Schumer got even more granular, estimating that if you have a talent for comedy, and work at it at least four nights a week, you can come up with a good 10-minute set in three years.        
“A solid hour consistently takes 10” years, she wrote. “I think maybe I don’t know.”        
That some comics emphasize years lived instead of time onstage hints at another argument, that stand-up, a personal art form that relies on the strength of one voice, requires life experience as much as practice. In an interview with the Web site Splitsider.com, Pete Holmes, a stand-up comic with a late-night talk show on TBS starting next month, argued against focusing exclusively on performing.        
“I think you need to live a life worth commenting on,” he said.        
Ken Reid, a comic from Boston with 11 years of experience, added that you can practice yourself out of being interesting. “You need enough skill to be able to express yourself,” he said, “but I’d much rather see an unpolished raw voice.”        
Mr. Obeid said he had thought about this point, but concluded that rigorous, compulsive enterprise is a reflection of who he is. “People have told me: ‘We don’t know who you are. We just see jokes,’ ” he said. “Now I’m like, ‘That’s just me.’ I’m a robot. I don’t care. I’m a machine. I stay in, do work, go to bed.”        
At the same time, he recognized that his relentless schedule played a part in the breakup with his girlfriend.        
“She was patient but wanted more from me, but I didn’t give it because I wanted to put this first,” he said, sounding downbeat. “When she was gone, I realized I could have compromised.”        
Still, his career has taken off. He made his late-night television debut on Wednesday on “Conan.” He’s working on a book and a documentary about the streak. After a 10-day rest, which begins after his 1,001st straight show in San Francisco on Saturday, Mr. Obeid will embark on a college tour. He says his onstage confidence is higher than ever, his writing leaner. With the tone of a war veteran, he talks about the nights his streak almost ended.        
On one Sunday late in his run, after failing to be booked at the Punch Line in San Francisco, Mr. Obeid was in a panic that the project would falter, so he showed up unannounced at a bar where he once appeared at an open-mike night. After much pleading, the manager turned off the karaoke machine to let him perform, but he was greeted with hostility and cursing.        
Five minutes in, a karaoke fan came up to Mr. Obeid, pretending to ask for a fist bump but instead punched him in the stomach. The music was turned back on, and the karaoke resumed.        
“I’d already done my five minutes, so I didn’t care,” Mr. Obeid said, relief washing over his face. “It was worth it.”

WASHINGTON — When a friend invited Teal Pennebaker to a party in the nation’s capital, Ms. Pennebaker had just one question: “I asked her, ‘Will there be a lot of Jonahs there?’ ” she said.        


Ms. Pennebaker, 31, a Washington- based policy writer, was referring to Jonah Ryan, the White House liaison to the vice president’s office on HBO’s “Veep” and one of the show’s deliciously obnoxious characters — memorable as much for basking in his proximity to power as for his attempts to use what little status he has to get sex.        
“It’s a dead-on, very apt way to describe a certain type of D.C. guy,” Ms. Pennebaker said. “It’s such a great descriptor. ‘Oh, he’s such a Jonah,’ or, ‘That party will be all Jonahs. Let’s not go.’ ”        
(For those curious, the answer came back no; the party was a Jonah-free zone.)        
If Aaron Sorkin’s “West Wing” represented an idealized Democratic presidency (powerful people doing good things) and inspired a swath of young viewers to enter public service, the latest generation of political television offers a more dystopian vision of the nation’s capital. The distinctly dark “House of Cards,” on Netflix, serves up powerful people doing bad things, while “Scandal,” on ABC, provides powerful people doing bad things in what they believe are in the service of good things.        
But “Veep,” which is in the running for four Emmy Awards this Sunday, including one for best comedy, manages to repurpose politics as lowbrow farce, and offers perhaps the most realistic glimpse at the banal tasks, humdrum days and outsize egos that make up the daily lives of the city’s political staff members: largely powerless people doing ... things.        
As such, the characters in the show — which revolves around fictional Vice President Selina Meyer (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and her often-hapless, always-cursing staff — have quickly become an in-the-know byword for certain D.C. archetypes, in the same way that “Sex and the City” captured a whole generation of women as Carries or Mirandas.        
“These things work their way into our vocabulary, particularly in self-referential communities that like seeing themselves portrayed in the media,” said Ron Klain, a former chief of staff to Vice Presidents Joseph R. Biden and Al Gore. “I think in all professions, people like shorthand ways of referring to things and using popular culture references to refer to things. And I think Washington in particular loves to see itself portrayed on television or loves to see itself portrayed in the movies.”        
For Bill Burton, a former deputy press secretary for President Obama, “Veep” allusions have become a convenient way to capture a certain type of Washington social-climbing behavior.        
“A situation will occur and I’ll say: ‘Do you watch ‘Veep’? That’s totally what Jonah would do,’ ” Mr. Burton said. “The Jonah is the most spot-on depiction of Washington ever constructed. I know 100 guys like that.”        
Though Jonah (or, in the words of Mr. Klain, “being an obnoxious, pompous jerk”) may be the prototype that has most pervaded the Washington lexicon, almost every character on the show can serve as a convenient nickname for a certain overly eager, overly machinating and overly self-promoting Washington staff member.        
There is Dan Egan, the handsome, ambitious, quick-witted and even quicker-talking deputy director of communications. There is Sue Wilson, the brusque and efficient keeper of the gate. There is Gary Walsh, the vice president’s body man, always at the ready with his trusty bag (itself nicknamed the Leviathan) to anticipate his boss’s latest whim.        
“I’ve heard people refer to junior staffers who have to do personal stuff for the principal as, ‘Oh, he has Gary’s job,’ or ‘He’s doing Gary work,’ ” Mr. Klain said.        
There is also Mike McLintock, who has been Vice President Meyer’s director of communications since her time in the Senate, but now seems largely a lumbering, dead-tree relic in a hyper-speed Twitter world.

Couples who work together can sometimes find themselves with an excess of togetherness. For John Feinblatt, 62, and Jonathan Mintz, 49, who have both worked for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg since 2002 — Mr. Feinblatt is his chief policy adviser, Mr. Mintz is the city’s commissioner of consumer affairs — that is hardly an issue. They see each other only occasionally during work hours. On Sundays, Mr. Feinblatt and Mr. Mintz (in glasses in photographs), whom Mr. Bloomberg married in a ceremony at Gracie Mansion in 2011, shortly after New York legalized same-sex marriage, try to give their BlackBerrys a rest (at least for short spells) and savor family time together. They live in a house in the West Village with their two daughters, Maeve, 10, whose nickname is Maisie, and Georgia, 8, and two dogs, a golden retriever, Tully, and a Havanese, Molly.        


EARLY RISER (Mr. Feinblatt): I’m the first one up, usually sort of 6:30ish, slightly later. First priority is to avoid waking the dogs, so I can get out of walking them. Then I try to do work while everybody’s asleep, so that I can clear as much of the deck for the day as possible.        
DOG DUTY (Mr. Mintz): I’ll do that while John is getting the girls up and out, which can be a process especially as they get older and have to try on several outfits.        
(Mr. Feinblatt): I have far more patience for that than Jonathan. Maisie not only picks out her outfit, but she then styles Georgia.        
BREAKFAST OPTIONS (Mr. Feinblatt): We have a high and low choice. Cafe Cluny is high, which is right across the street, so it’s sort of a natural.        
(Mr. Mintz): And around the corner is one of the best diners in the city, Bonbonniere.        Karsten Moran for The New York Times "

NBC quietly renewed the contract of its chief entertainment executive, Robert Greenblatt, extending his deal with the network until 2017.        


Executives confirmed the deal on Friday, insisting on anonymity because the network did not want to make an official announcement. Still, the decision represents a distinct vote of confidence in Mr. Greenblatt, who was put in place by the new Comcast management of NBC in January 2011, with the specific charge to reverse the long slide that had sunk NBC deep into last place in the networks’ prime-time ratings.        
NBC experienced a bit of resurgence last fall, especially with shows like “The Voice” and “Revolution,” then suffered another fallow period in the winter. But this season NBC has high hopes for several new series, including the comedy “The Michael J. Fox Show” and the drama “The Blacklist.”        
Probably not coincidentally, NBC did make one announcement on Friday: that it had finished second among the broadcast networks in ratings among viewers between 18 and 49 — a prime sales group for advertisers — over 52 weeks. It was the first time NBC beat both ABC and Fox in that category for a full year since 2002-03.

MONTCLAIR, N.J. — “Glacier,” an enthralling and important new dance work lasting 60 minutes, by the choreographer Liz Gerring, abounds in arresting contradictions. The dancers look relaxed and galvanized. They hurl themselves into impetuous slides, skim across the stage in nimble footwork, push their way urgently backward on all fours, shimmer in turning or bobbing jumps — and yet, amid the formal structures, always keep an informal quality, never letting the steps acquire any veneer of academicism. Steps look natural, athletic and exploratory — even when they then come around a second or third time with other dancers. The work has wit without quirkiness, passion without emotionalism: its moods change like the weather, and its ebbs and flows carry aspects of poetry and excitement.        


This work’s world premiere was given on Thursday as part of the Peak Performances series at the Alexander Kasser Theater at Montclair State University, where Robert Wierzel’s designs made virtuoso use of the stage. The main area is backed by a single white board, like a blank cinema screen. This, however, is just the central panel of an all-white triptych, so lighted by Mr. Wierzel that we first wonder if we’re watching mirror effects on either side. This question is furthered by Ms. Gerring’s choreography, which at times differentiates between the main stage area (dance) and visible wing space (nondance), but at other moments lets the dancing carry on into the wings, as if breaking down boundaries and worlds.        
The piece is marvelously heightened by Michael J. Schumacher’s music, from which the piece takes its title. He incorporates a field recording of sounds from a summer sojourn near Glacier Lake in Colorado into a score (taped, not played live) for guitar, harp, cello, clarinet, recorder, piano and other keyboard instruments. At times, patterns of sparse, descending two-note piano phrases recall Debussy’s “Études”; we seem close to the flapping of wings; an overlap of different instruments suggests not musical harmony but a soundscape of wide multiplicity.        
Pleasure in this work is clinched by how individual Ms. Gerring’s dancers look, and how specifically released by this choreography. I have admired Benjamin Asriel in works by several contemporary choreographers. Here — he arrives relatively late in the piece — he looks newly focused but free. In one phrase, as he tips slowly forward on one leg in an arabesque line, he becomes like the needle of a magnetic compass, piercingly direct in his adjustment of the angle.        
Brandon Collwes, best known from his years with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, has always danced with a large-scale innocence; here that quality gains new intensity. Stepping repeatedly onto the ball of one foot in a series of turns but each time tilting his torso way to one side, he makes you feel in your own body the physics of the step. Tony Neidenbach, Adele Nickel, Brandin Steffensen, Jake Szczypek, Jessica Weiss and Claire Westby complete the team, changing the mood with each entry.        
Entrances and exits are lively ingredients of Ms. Gerring’s style. Often, she makes compositional jokes out of them, no sooner bringing a dancer onstage than sending him off again, only to recall him a moment later, this time for an extended stay. Two women end a duet with an unforgettable exit. Side by side, they find themselves holding hands as they, jumping upward from both feet, slowly retreat on a diagonal path: it’s the way that they, parallel and synchronized in this wonderful image of naïveté, hover artlessly in each jump that catches the heart. Mr. Neidenbach, a longtime Gerring performer of marvelously athletic presence, enters by going around in a circle on one side of the stage as he alternately runs and walks.        
That alternation — run a half-circle, then walk another, with minimum gear change, repeatedly — is one of the dance contrasts that proliferate in this piece, rivetingly. Later — hauntingly — Mr. Neidenbach crosses the stage in one forward skipping hopscotch sequence of tiny but top-speed steps, then, without missing a beat, retreats backward in a big crawling phrase on all fours: two utterly opposed kinds of movement, both delivered coolly but excitingly.        
Another beauty of the Gerring style is the keen focus she gives to her dancers. They don’t just do movement, they aim it. Witness the opening phrase: A man and a woman enter together, stand and wait, looking and bending forward. And then, simultaneously, they turn their eyes, heads and one arm upward and sideways. A simple stroke, it at once establishes the full three-dimensionality of their style. A later motif, also basic, is a side-to-side phrase in which the dancer throws up a right arm, then, stepping the other way, the left arm. The head turns to look at the view the arm has opened up. As you watch, you sense yourself doing it.        
At first, “Glacier” looks like a study in stylized pedestrianism, flat-footed, with the dancers showing how exactly they perform nonvirtuoso moves. But its texture builds up and grows complicated. Women, then men, travel on half-toe across the stage; jumps and turns enter the vocabulary. There are eight dancers, though usually fewer are onstage at any one time; it becomes customary to see several things going on simultaneously. Simple movements remain central, as when four men stand in a row, facing us, with arms outspread. One woman, entering, seems to listen to one man’s heart; two other women, unnoticing, dance in the background.        
Dancers here are primarily soloists. But partnering does occur, both same sex and, especially, opposite sex. There’s a sequence for three male-female couples: while the geometric patterning is satisfying (they at one point correspond to the three screens behind), there’s no one moral pattern for male-female behavior; you see women leading and supporting, as well as following and being lifted.        
As “Glacier” deepens and grows in texture, it changes from a seemingly analytical study into a diverse world. The analytical quality, which never vanishes, adds fascination. The diversity adds humanity. By scrutinizing movement and demonstrating its multifaceted complexity, “Glacier” proves not only absorbing but also moving.        



 
“Glacier” runs through Sunday at the Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, Montclair, N.J.; (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org.

“Miss America victory marred by racist slurs.” — Time, Sept. 16        


“2013 Miss Universe pageant to remain in Russia despite LGBT protests.” — Boston.com, Aug. 21        
“French moving to ban child beauty pageants: should we?” — CNN, Sept. 19.        
Not since so-called “bra-burning” protests upended the 1968 Miss America contest have beauty pageants attracted so much controversy.        
In late August, Bravo’s Andy Cohen pulled out of his commitment to be a host of the Miss Universe pageant because it was being held in Russia, where new antigay laws criminalize the promotion of “nontraditional sexual relationships.” Mr. Cohen told an E! News reporter that he “didn’t feel right as a gay man stepping foot into Russia.”        
Then last Sunday, the Miss America pageant crowned a 24-year-old of Indian descent, Nina Davuluri from Syracuse, which was seen as a sign of cultural progress until racist messages popped up on Twitter.        
Those who had written off pageants as anachronisms of the tail-fin era suddenly found that the swimsuit-in-heels rituals were back in the cultural-wars cross-fire.        
In the case of Miss America, no sooner had the glimmering crown been placed on Ms. Davuluri than the furor erupted.        
“Congratulations Al Qaeda,” tweeted one user, @Blayne_MkItRain (the account has since been deleted). “Our Miss America is one of you.”        
Bloggers were quickly compiling lists of the most inflammatory tweets, including a Buzzfeed listicle that generated more than five million views.        
“Idiot racists got so mad, they started mixing up Indian, Indian-American, Arab, Muslim, and everything in between,” wrote Laura Beck on Jezebel, summarizing a collection of hate-tweets that she included in her post. “It’s (literarily) a most impressive display of dumb mixed with intolerance and even more stupidity.”        
The cultural relevance of pageants, it seems, only spikes whenever they can be dragged through the mud.        
“Pageants are public cultural spectacles with huge built-in audiences, so they are a platform for protest,” said Carol Hanisch, a feminist activist. She would know, since she initiated the 1968 protest on the Atlantic City Boardwalk, where a group calling itself New York Radical Women tossed “instruments of female torture” — hair curlers, girdles, Playboy magazines — into a garbage can. (No bras, in fact, were burned.)        
Pageants continued to serve as a battleground, even as the culture wars shifted. In 1984, race was the issue when Vanessa Williams was crowned as the first African-America Miss America; she was receiving death threats and hate mail even before she was forced to resign after the publication of nude pictures of her in Penthouse magazine.        
More recently, the 2009 Miss USA contest was embroiled over gay rights when the first runner-up, Carrie Prejean of California, attracted boos during the telecast when she voiced views against same-sex marriage.        
Even that now seems like a relic of a simpler time, before social media made everyone a critic. Viewers last week were debating whether Ms. Davuluri was a victim of bias or prejudiced herself, when Page Six reported that she had referred to the previous winner, Mallory Hagan, as “fat.” (Ms. Davulari has denied the report.)        
“They should strip her of her crown,” wrote a user called Alicat0816, in response to the report, “and send runner-up to the next pageant.”        
All the chatter on blogs and social media did not seem to hurt the show’s popularity. According to Nielsen, the ABC broadcast of the pageant, which crowned the winner for 2014, had its best ratings in nearly decade: it drew an average of 8.6 million viewers, a 21 percent increase compared with the contest for 2013, which was in January.

SAN SALVADOR — El Salvador have banned 14 international footballers for life for match-fixing, including some of their best-known and most experienced players.        


One other player was given an 18-month ban, two were suspended for six months, one was acquitted while four more face further investigation, the country's football federation (FESFUT) president Carlos Mendez told a news conference on Friday.        
""The work of the disciplinary commission has been exhaustive. We have used valuable information which has come from interviews, video accounts from people who have had the strength to declare and help us find those responsible,"" said Mendez.        
The 14 given life bans were goalkeepers Dagoberto Portillo and Miguel Montes, defenders Ramon Flores, Miguel Granadino, Luis Anaya, Mardoqueo Henriquez, Alfredo Pacheco, Marvin Gonzalez and Reynaldo Hernandez and midfielders Osael Romero, Darwin Bonilla, Dennis Alas, Ramon Sanchez and Christian Castillo.        
Pacheco, Romero, Gonzalez, Alas and Sanchez have more than 50 caps apiece.        
Carlos Romero was banned for 18 months, Eliseo Quintanilla and Victor Turcios for six each and Carlos Carillo was acquitted.        
Rodolfo Zelaya, Emerson Umana, Rodrigo Martinez, Benji Villalobos will face further investigation, FESFUT said.        
All 22 players had been provisionally suspended since August.        
""The national teams will continue with their agenda,"" added Mendez. ""The players pass by and the institutions are permanent.""        
Mendez said the matches affected included a 5-0 defeat by Mexico at the 2011 Gold Cup.        
Central America is especially vulnerable to match-fixing as many clubs struggle financially, playing conditions are poor and footballers often do not get paid on time.        
Last year Guatemalan internationals Guillermo Ramirez, Gustavo Cabrera and Yony Flores were banned for life by their country's federation for trying to persuade team mates to manipulate a friendly against Costa Rica.        
The case was brought to light by the then national team coach Ever Almeida and striker Carlos Ruiz.        
Nicaragua defender Armando Collado was also banned for life over a friendly against Guatemala played in 2010.

JAFFNA, Sri Lanka — The thugs first appeared around 11:20 on Thursday night, a dozen or so men lurking outside her house. Two wore army uniforms.        


Ananthi Sasitharan — a Tamil candidate in the first provincial elections to be held in 25 years in the former insurgent stronghold here — said she had woken up her three daughters and prepared for the worst. She called a few friends, who soon appeared and persuaded her and her daughters to sneak out the back. It was a good thing they left.        
Ten of her supporters stayed behind to watch the house. A few started playing a Sri Lankan card game called Monkeys and Donkeys, but before they could finish even a few hands, four trucks pulled up outside and disgorged more than 100 men. Most of them were wearing army uniforms and carrying guns and wooden clubs, according to the accounts of several witnesses.        
“Where’s Ananthi?” the thugs started shouting. “Where’s Ananthi?”        
And then they attacked.        
Four years after Sri Lanka’s long civil war came to a bloody end, the first provincial council elections since 1988 are being held Saturday in the country’s Tamil-dominated north amid sporadic reports of violence and intimidation. There are many Tamil parties vying for seats under the flag of the Tamil National Alliance, competing with candidates from the governing coalition, the United People’s Freedom Alliance, which controls more than two-thirds of the national Parliament.        
The council is fairly toothless, because President Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka has centralized much of the government’s powers in his and his family’s hands. But the election has become an important symbol to the Tamil people as well as to international monitors about whether the Rajapaksas are willing to countenance even cosmetic steps toward reconciliation with the Tamils.        
“The military has been visiting houses all over the area and telling people not to vote for the Tamil National Alliance,” Mavai S. Senathirajah, deputy leader of the Tamil alliance, said in an interview. “We will not be intimidated.”        
The war’s end has been beneficial to Sri Lanka, an island of about 20 million people split between the dominant Singhalese and the minority Tamil. Roads have been rebuilt, tourists have returned to its crystalline beaches and tea estates, and the pervading sense of unease that gripped the country for decades has largely evaporated. New train tracks have nearly reached Jaffna, at the northern tip of the island.        
Yet, signs of the violent past remain. Destroyed houses, burned-out churches and the broken carcass of a water tower still litter the landscape in once war-torn areas. There is growing evidence that in the course of war the Sri Lankan government may have killed as many as 40,000 people — many of them innocent civilians — particularly at the close of the war. The United Nations Human Rights Council has voted repeatedly to condemn the government’s failure to investigate potential war crimes even as a string of shocking videos that appear to show the murders of innocents leaks out of the country.        
The Rajapaksa government, meanwhile, has undermined the independence of both the judiciary and the news media. Navi Pillay, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, accused the government last month of “heading in an increasingly authoritarian direction.” On Friday, Ms. Pillay accused the Sri Lankan government of waging a disinformation campaign against her.        
For the Rajapaksa government, the international criticism is worrisome. The Sri Lankan economy depends on tourism and foreign investment, and in November the country will host a summit meeting of Commonwealth leaders, a diplomatic coup. Many of the top hotels in the capital, Colombo, are undergoing renovations to ready themselves for the delegations.        
An election in the northern province that is judged as free and fair could help improve the country’s international reputation. But it is far from clear that election monitors will bless the effort.

As the pianist Ahmad Jamal and the members of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra took their bows at the Rose Theater on Thursday night, someone in the crowd filed a simple but urgent request. “Poinciana!” he shouted against the applause. “Poinciana!” he shouted again, hoarsely. “Poinciana! Poinciana! Poinciana!” Eventually reality set in: the house lights went up, and the audience began to file toward the doors.        


“Poinciana,” in case the name means nothing to you, is a tune by Nat Simon that Mr. Jamal recorded with his trio in 1958. A small masterpiece of floating groove, careful in its application of pressure, it belongs to the small society of jazz compositions that have become runaway pop hits. Just as “Take Five” defined Brubeck and Desmond, it has been an ageless signature for Mr. Jamal — and maybe a bit of a burden, given the irreducible scope of his output since.        
Why should it matter that Mr. Jamal didn’t play “Poinciana” here, amid the festive light-pomp of the season opener for Jazz at Lincoln Center? He did play it in the same room a couple of years ago; likewise when he opened Jazz at Lincoln Center’s 2008-9 season, in a concert structured exactly like this one. And there was a welcome hint of the tune’s gait and bass line in “Saturday Morning,” a quietly majestic ballad that Mr. Jamal offered in the first half.        
So the omission meant nothing, except perhaps as a metaphor. At the end of an elegant two-hour concert that showcased Mr. Jamal’s capacity for building tension within tight spaces, it was bewilderingly easy to feel unfulfilled. Just as that guy barking his request did, I left the Rose Theater in disappointment, thinking about missed opportunities. For me it wasn’t about a song, but rather a spirit of engagement.        
Mr. Jamal, 83, organizes his music as a series of dynamic events, pinballing between binary extremes: loud/soft, fast/slow, big/small. During the concert’s first half, which featured Reginald Veal on bass, Herlin Riley on drums and Manolo Badrena on percussion, he ran the bandstand like a contractor surveying a job site, often turning from the piano to wave an arm or shoot a glare. Every song in the quartet’s 40-minute set involved a form of Latin rhythm, and every song ended with a crisp, decisive snap.        
Mr. Riley and Mr. Veal make an ideal rhythm team for this music, just as they have for Wynton Marsalis, Jazz at Lincoln Center’s artistic director. On “Morning Mist” and “Silver,” they laid an earthy foundation, trancelike but alert. They were impeccable on “Saturday Morning,” the title track of Mr. Jamal’s new album on the Jazz Village label, which features the same personnel. But the whole mood was terse, reined in.        
That extended to the concert’s second half, featuring enlargements of Mr. Jamal’s music by members of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. One problem was the harmonic inertia of the material: “Baalbek,” in an arrangement by the alto saxophonist Sherman Irby, couldn’t gather much forward pull even during a trumpet solo by Mr. Marsalis. (It was his only solo all night, which made the concert’s title, “Ahmad Jamal and Wynton Marsalis,” a little misleading.)        
Where the second half hit its stride was in two arrangements that captured the variability of Mr. Jamal’s style. The trumpeter Marcus Printup made “Manhattan Reflections” into an episodic saga, with punchy accents giving way to grand, flowing gestures. And the saxophonist Ted Nash gave “Kaleidoscope” a marvelous range of ideas, including a burst of Dixielandish counterpoint followed by a lush canopy of modern chords, in descending sequence.        
Then, after an interlude by Mr. Jamal, the band revved back into gear, swinging hard behind a commanding solo by the trombonist Elliot Mason. Somehow this was the evening’s only stretch of swinging rhythm, but that wasn’t why it felt like a revelation. It was because Mr. Jamal and the band seemed both locked in and free; for a few fleeting moments, they left nothing to be desired.        



 
Ahmad Jamal appears through Saturday at the Rose Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway; (212) 721-6500, jalc.org.  
 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 24, 2013A music review on Saturday about the opening concert of the Jazz at Lincoln Center season, featuring the pianist Ahmad Jamal, misidentified the composer of “Poinciana,” which became a pop hit for Mr. Jamal when he recorded it with his trio in 1958. It was composed by Nat Simon, not by Mr. Jamal. (Buddy Bernier wrote the lyrics.)

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia — France ended Spain's reign as European basketball champion Friday with a 75-72 overtime victory behind 32 points from Tony Parker and set up a final against Lithuania.        


Two-time defending champion Spain led by 14 points at halftime, but Parker led France's comeback after the break. His 3-pointer with 2 minutes left gave France its first lead of the second half at 64-63.        
""We wanted to be aggressive, but until halftime we weren't really playing,"" France coach Vincent Collet said. ""We talked about it during the break and we came back very different. They couldn't score for five minutes in the third and even when they started hitting shots again, our spirit stayed the same.""        
Parker had a chance to put France ahead in regulation with the score tied at 65-65, but his drive to the basket was blocked by Rudy Fernandez with 11 seconds left. Jose Calderon then missed a 3-point attempt at the other end.        
In overtime, Parker and Antoine Diot scored France's last eight points from the free-throw line to keep France in front. Marc Gasol missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer after Rodriguez had missed a previous attempt to tie it.        
""We had the last shots in both regulation and overtime, but we missed,"" Spain coach Juan Orenga said.        
Diot was the only other French player in double figures with 10 points, while Gasol led Spain with 19 points and nine rebounds and Fernandez scored 17. Point guard Ricky Rubio was limited to two points, one assist and four turnovers.        
""We put a lot of intensity in the game and it allowed us to come back in the second half,"" Diot said.        
Spain beat France to win the title two years ago, but this time it was missing Pau Gasol and Juan Carlos Navarro. Spain will play Croatia for the bronze.        
""It's very disappointing to lose a game we led for 37 minutes. We played great defense in the first half but in the second we let them play their rhythm,"" said Rodriguez, who finished with 11 points, 9 assists and 6 rebounds.        
Parker finished with five turnovers and one assist, along with six rebounds.        
""We were scared at halftime. Now, we have to control our joy. Two years ago we were so happy for having qualified for the Olympics that we botched the final,"" Parker said.        
Lithuania reached its first final since winning the title 10 years ago by beating Croatia 77-62. It's aiming for its fourth championship.        
Jonas Maciulis led Lithuania with 23 points, Linas Kleiza added 22 and Mantas Kalnietis had 18. Lithuania center Jonas Valanciunas provided some big defensive plays with five blocks, while Bojan Bogdanovic led Croatia with 15 points.        
""It was a difficult game mentally because we knew how important it was,"" Maciulis said. ""Both teams came out shot-shy and we were the first to take the lead.""

LONDON — The Americans are coming, and the British literary world is not happy.        


The Man Booker Prize, which had been open to English-language novels from Britain and the Commonwealth, has just gone global, producing anxiety about damage to cultural diversity and fears that the American cultural hyperpower that dominates movies and television will crush the small literary novel.        
“It’s rather like a British company being taken over by some worldwide conglomerate,” said Melvyn Bragg, an author and television host in Britain.        
The Booker Prize for fiction, begun in 1969, was always something that Britain and its former territories could call their own, seen as a bulwark against the spread of the American novel, that globalized product of the world’s richest market.        
The award — with its publicity, its paycheck and its immediate impact on sales — has been an important boost to the careers of Canadians like Michael Ondaatje and Yann Martel, and Indians like Kiran Desai and Aravind Adiga. It has brought attention to novelists previously unknown and unpublished in the United States, and it has been an important encouragement to publishers of quality fiction.        
This week, the chairman of the Booker Prize Foundation, Jonathan Taylor, said, “We are abandoning the constraints of geography and national boundaries” to become a truly international prize, as a result of consultations that began in 2011. The change could enhance the Booker’s “prestige and reputation through expansion, rather than by setting up a separate prize” for Americans, he said.        
Next year, the prize will be open to any work originally written in English and published in Britain, not just works by citizens of Britain, the Commonwealth, Ireland and Zimbabwe, bringing immediate concerns that American novels will dominate, “simply through an economic superpower exerting its own literary tastes,” the British novelist Philip Hensher, who has been both a Booker finalist and a judge, said in an interview.        
More troubling, he said, will be the loss of “new, interesting voices.” American novels are already culturally dominant, he said: “It’s hard to think of American novels that don’t make their way into the larger English world. But I can think of Canadian, Indian, African novels that struggle to find a broader readership.”        
Karolina Sutton, a literary agent who works with both American and British authors, said that the winner of the Booker sometimes sees a sales bump of hundreds of thousands of copies, an effect that could multiply if the winner were American.        
“I think it’s terrific for American publishers, terrific for American writers, and it’s not bad news for readers,” she said. “It will suddenly become more competitive.”        
Criticism of the prize has been a literary sport since its inception, with complaints about the winners, the judges and even the prize dinners. A. L. Kennedy, who was a judge in 1996, famously and ungrammatically said that the winner was determined by “who knows who, who’s sleeping with who, who’s selling drugs to who, who’s married to who, whose turn it is.”        
Ms. Kennedy is in favor of the expansion of the Booker, however, noting that other, newer prizes open to any English-language novel published here, like the Folio Prize (£40,000, or about $64,000, which makes its first award next January) and the International Impac Dublin Literary Award (100,000 euros, or about $135,000, and also open to translations) have been “nipping at its heels.” The Man Booker award comes with a prize of £50,000, or about $80,000.        
The Booker has also become less literary, some argue, suggesting that since the Man Group, a multinational financial company, took it over in 2002, the renamed Man Booker Prize has become more middlebrow.        
Even this year, one of the six finalists, Jhumpa Lahiri’s “Lowland,” has been criticized as an American novel. Born in London, Ms. Lahiri moved to the United States at the age of 2 and generally writes about the experience of exiles living in the United States.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 24, 2013Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about reaction in Britain to the decision to open the Man Booker Prize for fiction to any work originally written in English and published in Britain — not just to works by citizens of Britain, other Commonwealth countries, Ireland and Zimbabwe — misstated the size of the monetary award that accompanies the prize. It is £50,000, or about $80,000 — not £60,000 (about $96,000).

When NBC announced recently that “Today” would host a book club featuring online discussion groups, I thought it was a fine idea.        


I had long romanticized my flesh-and-blood book club in Manhattan because it made me feel as if an important group valued me. When I described fellow members to other people, I led with their strengths and accomplishments: a brilliant ex-banker, a onetime speechwriter for a sitting vice president and a powerful intellectual with a global following.        
But the truth is, we were a bunch of yentas who (sometimes) read the same book, superficially discussed it (in a most erudite way, we thought) and then moved on to our favorite subject: ourselves. Failing marriages, high-achieving kids and kitchen renovations were just as likely to be topics of discussion as the nuances of “Daniel Deronda.”        
And sometimes, frankly, there was more blood than flesh. Last winter, a particularly ugly encounter about whether we could deviate from our practice of alternating classic and contemporary fiction ended with an expletive sent my way. That night I walked out of the gathering, telling two people within earshot I would never return.        
I had long dismissed online book clubs, believing they lacked the intimacy and spontaneity of in-person get-togethers and that they were the terrain of quiet loners who feared eye contact and physical closeness. These days I’ve come to think book club intimacy is largely overrated and, depending on who’s on the other end, eye contact can be quite terrifying.        
I’m far from alone. For Eileen Mendell of Ventnor, N.J., book club meetings frequently resemble explosive family counseling sessions where every infraction becomes indicative of a deep character flaw.        
“I have personality clashes with just about everybody, and normally I’m a happy, friendly, cheerful person, so it’s strictly the book group that gives me problems,” Ms. Mendell said. “There are some women who talk about their children nonstop and express no interest in anyone else’s children.”        
Yet Ms. Mendell balked at the suggestion that she may fit in better with an online club. “It sounds so cold,” she said. “I’d much rather suffer through the meetings than not see their faces. Maybe I enjoy being a curmudgeon. And maybe I don’t want to give up my cantankerousness.”        
Many people, though, have come to see online book clubs as an ideal arrangement. Felicia Day, 34, an actress who was featured on the 2003 season of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” founded Vaginal Fantasy Hangout, an online club dedicated to romance fiction with a paranormal twist. The hangout, which began about a year and a half ago and is female-only (as far as Ms. Day can tell), is sponsored by Goodreads, a Web site that catalogs books and helps readers set up book groups.        
Vaginal Fantasy Hangout, led by Ms. Day and three co-hosts, has almost 10,000 members and is organized around monthly live-streamed discussions about two books. In between, members chat online, which according to Ms. Day helps the cohesion of the group.        
“I travel quite a bit, and the online component makes it part of the everyday social pattern,” she said. “There are so many ways to interact because everyone is always online. That’s what the Internet does best: it connects people who have a passion for something.”        
Jessica Coen, 33, said she has discovered literature-oriented gatherings work better in theory than in practice. She joined a book club a few years ago and dutifully read the first two books, but was unable to attend either meeting.        
“That was the end of my book club experience, and I think that’s the problem with book clubs in general and it’s why online book clubs are thriving right now,” said Ms. Coen, who is the editor in chief of Jezebel, the popular culture blog. “People are busy, and even if you set aside time and you’re looking forward to discussing the book, you can’t always make it.”        
During the summer of 2012 Jezebel ran its own Internet book club, discussing “Gone Girl,” by Gillian Flynn. Ms. Coen said it was a great success and would likely be repeated.        
Chris O’Connor, a real estate agent in the Tampa Bay area of Florida, said he became a convert to the online book club after his first wife left him more than a decade ago.        
“In order to deal with the depression and all that, I tried starting a local book group, but it didn’t work out,” said Mr. O’Connor, 44.        
He posted ads for recruits, hoping to find fellow bookworms who would sip wine and deconstruct texts. Instead, he said, the turnout tended toward “unsavory” characters. That’s when Mr. O’Connor founded Booktalk, the online book club that he’s been running since 2002.

                            It could be because of Edward J. Snowden. But it’s more likely the influence of “Homeland.”        


                            Government secrets and betrayal are at the heart of two of the better new network dramas this season: “Hostages” on CBS, and “The Blacklist” on NBC, which both start on Monday. Like “Homeland,” the C.I.A. thriller on Showtime that begins a third season on Sept. 29, these shows are immersed in Washington intrigue. Each pivots on a heroine who is torn between confrontation and collusion with a male adversary.        

                            Both are suspenseful and artfully layered, and both owe a debt to “Homeland.” But they also share at least one inherent weakness with that Showtime hit.        

“Hostages” stars Toni Collette as Dr. Ellen Sanders, a surgeon whose family is taken captive by a rogue F.B.I. agent, Duncan Carlisle (Dylan McDermott). Carlisle then orders Ellen to make her most famous patient die on the operating table.        

                            “Don’t think of it as killing the president,” Carlisle says. “Think of it as saving your family.”        

                            There is a murky conspiracy at the top, but even Ellen’s seemingly normal suburban husband and two children have secret agendas of their own.        

                            On “The Blacklist,” a young F.B.I. agent, Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone), is paired with an unlikely partner: Raymond Reddington (James Spader), a former government agent turned criminal consigliere, who sells secrets and abets mobsters, thieves and terrorists worldwide. In the pilot, Reddington turns himself in and offers to help the F.B.I. track down his blacklist of master criminals, but on the condition that he deal only with Elizabeth. (The show also borrows a bit from “Silence of the Lambs,” but, in this case, Mr. Spader chews the scenery, not human kidneys.)        

                            The many layers of feints and puzzles are compelling, but it’s hard to see how they can last more than a season or two. The first two episodes of Season 3 of “Homeland” are disappointing, and that’s almost inevitable.        

                            Conventional television shows are called series for a reason: whether it is “Bonanza” or “Law & Order: SVU,” these are serial dramas engineered to last, with replaceable characters and story lines that begin and end in under an hour.        

                            The best shows these days are more like movies than serials, with narrative arcs that sweep the action and the lead characters to a fixed conclusion. And subsequent seasons are more like movie sequels: even good ones rarely live up to the first, and the more there are, the more they strain to work.        

                            Shows with two dueling characters, moreover, tend to have shorter shelf lives than those with a single central villain. Tony Soprano kept his criminal enterprise going for six seasons; Walter White of “Breaking Bad” is on the verge of shutting down after five; and women sometimes outlast the men: Nancy Botwin, the pot-dealing heroine of “Weeds,” hung on for a remarkable eight seasons.        

                            When a drama follows the collision course of two enemies of the opposite sex, sooner or later they have to consummate their love, or their hate. It’s not just sexual tension that wears off after contact; so does the piquancy of conflict.        

                            The conceit of the first season of “Homeland” was that Carrie (Claire Danes) alone suspects that the P.O.W.-turned-hero Brody (Damian Lewis) is a traitor; by the end of the second season, only she believes he is innocent. That formula can hold a viewer’s attention for only so long before it starts to feel forced.        

                            The third season doesn’t just stretch credulity, it tries patience: Brody is not in the first two episodes — there isn’t even a scene foreshadowing his imminent return — and there are only so many times viewers can watch Carrie go off her medication or Brody’s teenage daughter, Dana (Morgan Saylor), act out.        

                            The Brody family dynamic isn’t the one that counts in this spy thriller, it’s Carrie’s dysfunctional C.I.A. family that matters. Fortunately, at least one character, her mentor, Saul (Mandy Patinkin), dances to a new tune.

LOS ANGELES — The Emmy Awards have witnessed many new players on the red carpet over the years, but there has never been a gate-crasher quite like Netflix.        


Its “House of Cards” is nominated for outstanding drama, the first time that a program distributed on the Internet has competed at the Emmys right alongside programs distributed through rabbit ears and satellite dishes. And the prospect that a streaming video service like Netflix could end up a winner at the Emmys ceremony on Sunday night has cast a spotlight on just how profoundly the television landscape has changed.        
Still, most television critics and other self-professed Emmys experts suspect that it’s the cable channel AMC, not Netflix, that will have the most to celebrate at the awards show. “Breaking Bad,” which has been nominated for best drama four times before but has never won, is the clear favorite this year. In an e-mail, Debra Birnbaum, the editor in chief of TV Guide Magazine, borrowed a phrase from the series’ meth lord Walter White: “ ‘Breaking Bad’ is the danger this Emmy season.”        
And that’s with just the first half of the show’s final season in contention for an Emmy this year. AMC broke the season into two parts, and only the first half was televised before the May cutoff date for Emmy eligibility. But the second half started to be shown in August, just as Emmy voters were receiving their ballots in the mail. What’s more, the reviews have been uniformly glowing, and the ratings have been building as the Sept. 29 finale approaches. Last Sunday’s episode, which generated more than 16,000 Twitter messages a minute at one point, was the most-watched episode yet, with at least 6.4 million viewers.        
So it stands to reason that the Emmy results might reflect all the excitement. (Ballots were due on Aug. 30.) This week the Web site Gold Derby, which tracks Hollywood’s horse races, called “Breaking Bad” the “overwhelming front-runner.”        
As it turns out, the series will be competing with the Emmys (televised by CBS) on Sunday night. The three-hour backslapping ceremony will begin at 8 p.m. Eastern, while the 75-minute penultimate episode of “Breaking Bad” will begin at 9 p.m. Since the drama prize is handed out last, “Breaking Bad” viewers can change channels afterward to see if the show won. (And if it doesn’t, well, the second half of the final season will be eligible again in 2014.)        
For AMC, an Emmy for “Breaking Bad” would be a welcome acknowledgment of how it, like Netflix, has changed television. Until 2008, the only winners of the top drama Emmy, the most coveted of all, were broadcast networks and HBO. Then “Mad Men” came along and AMC became the first ad-supported cable channel to win the top drama award. “Mad Men” kept winning, for four seasons in a row, until Showtime’s “Homeland” snapped its streak last year.        
This time around, both are nominated again, along with “Breaking Bad,” “House of Cards,” PBS’s “Downton Abbey,” and HBO’s “Game of Thrones.”        
Netflix won’t say how many people have watched “House of Cards.” HBO’s “Thrones” might be the most popular of the six; HBO said the season finale in June attracted nearly 14 million viewers once on-demand viewership was calculated. About 12 million people saw the season finale of “Downton Abbey”; more than seven million saw “Homeland”; and nearly five million saw “Mad Men.”        
For the second year in a row, no dramas from the big four broadcast networks were nominated. But the broadcasters were somewhat better represented in the best comedy category, where ABC’s “Modern Family” is vying for its fourth straight win. It is up against NBC’s “30 Rock,” which ended in May and is eligible for the final time; CBS’s “Big Bang Theory”; HBO’s “Girls” and “Veep”; and FX’s “Louie.”        
The one Netflix comedy series that some thought would be nominated, “Arrested Development,” was not. But one of the stars of “Arrested,” Jason Bateman, is up for best lead actor in a comedy. Back on the drama side, Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright are both up for lead actor and actress for “House of Cards.”        
Bruce Rosenblum, the chairman of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, said that Netflix’s nominations illustrated the evolving nature of TV.        
“This is just the beginning,” he said. “If you look at the quantity of product being developed at Netflix and Amazon and Hulu and Xbox, it’s certainly reasonable to expect that this evolution will accelerate. Having said that, the quality of content on broadcast and cable is certainly at an all-time high as well.”        
Netflix’s presence at the Emmys is the result of rules that were amended about six years ago to allow some (but not all) Internet shows. Netflix is technically already a winner: it picked up two awards for casting and cinematography last weekend at the Creative Arts portion of the Emmys. But to put that in context, HBO picked up 20, including eight for its TV movie “Behind the Candelabra.” The recorded Creative Arts ceremony will be shown by FXX on Saturday.        
The prime-time ceremony on CBS will take stock of what many observers have called a golden age of TV. There remains a wide gulf, however, between the audience for the Academy Awards, which drew about 40 million viewers this year, and the Emmys, which attracted about 13 million in 2012. The Academy Awards have some advantages: namely, movie stars and 10 brand-new films in competition each year. The Emmys, on the other hand, often celebrate returning shows with relatively small audiences.        
But Mr. Rosenblum voiced confidence that the ratings for the Emmys would defy trend lines and grow over time. “The industry is accelerating from a quality standpoint and from a buzz and pop culture standpoint,” he said, “and that at some point will be reflected in our ratings.”

Enough, please, about the cultural “elite,” that all-but-useless category, so baggy it now seems to include practically everyone. No, what we really want to know about are the cultural elect — the famous people other famous people connive to meet.        


The kind of people, that is, who are likely to be found in the Upper West Side apartment of Antonio Monda, whether it’s a half-dozen novelists and spouses for Sunday brunch or weeknight dinner, or the 75 to 120 journalists, critics, painters, curators, Columbia professors and more who crowd in to the after-parties for one of the almost continuous film-related events he runs, either as organizer or interviewer, or both, at Lincoln Center, the Morgan Library and the Museum of Modern Art.        
Recent sightings included Philip Roth (scrunched in a corner, under the bookshelves that cover an entire wall); Robert De Niro (who strode in a beat after Martin Amis slipped out to smoke a hand-rolled cigarette); Zadie Smith (springing up from the table to chase down her toddler); and Jovanotti, the bearded king of Italian rap, whose Twitter followers at one point outnumbered the pope’s.        
At a time when so many Manhattan gatherings can seem as transactional as a conference call, Mr. Monda reigns as the host of the city’s liveliest, some say only remaining, cultural salon.        
Only don’t tell him so. The word “salon” makes him wince. “In Italy, it gives the impression of being lightweight,” Mr. Monda, who will turn 51 next month, said recently in his office at New York University, where he is a member of the film and television department’s faculty. He prefers “laboratory of ideas.”        
Mr. Monda’s normal style is casual, but he was expected at a gala later, and so was sheathed in a blue Brioni suit (purchased at a discount courtesy of his friend Gay Talese) with purple suspenders and a blue tie dotted with red.        
Mr. Monda’s office is both archive and storefront. The walls are covered with movie posters and stills, and the bookshelves include translations of his books, many of them collected interviews with a range of eminences, like Don DeLillo and Martin Scorsese.        
“Laboratory” seems a clinical description for Mr. Monda’s cozy at-homes, but admirers agree that his parties generate unusual excitement. “There’s always a crackle of energy in the air,” the novelist Colum McCann, who has known Mr. Monda since 2007, wrote in an e-mail. “What Antonio is essentially interested in is having people bounce off one another so that what results is the art of great conversation.”        
There was, for instance, the night Mr. Monda screened Luchino Visconti’s film “The Leopard,” based on the classic Italian novel, then led a discussion on the challenges of adaptation and dubbing. The conversation flowed easily and was mercifully free of self-promotion.        
“Nobody goes to a Monda lunch to sell a book or flog a new movie,” Mr. McCann observed. “It would be very vulgar to take out a stack of business cards.”        
The good talk is lubricated by sumptuous but unpretentious dining. “I think the secret to his parties is the food,” Isabella Rossellini, a longtime friend, said in a phone interview. “The food is there for everyone. It’s abundant. And you come and go as you please.”        
At Mr. Monda’s, she can be seen in a sweater and jeans, getting up to refill her plate with the home-cooked meals prepared by Mr. Monda’s wife, Jacqueline Greaves, who was born in Jamaica and has created her own fusion of island and classic Italian cuisine: empanadas, shrimp balls, crostini with pesto and mushrooms, pasta with a hearty tuna sauce (with pine nuts, cinnamon, raisins), bowls of giant strawberries — washed down with Chianti or a white wine purchased in the neighborhood.        
Such improvisation would be unthinkable at other Manhattan dinner parties. “Paparazzi are around,” Ms. Rossellini said. “You have to show you’re the best dressed, that you’re young and thin. Every time I’m invited, I have to evaluate: ‘Do I have to have a makeup artist?’ ‘How much does the dress cost?’ It’s very commercial.”        
Informal though he is, Mr. Monda, a screenwriter and filmmaker before he moved to the United States in 1994, imparts an air of the grande spettacolo to all his productions, including his N.Y.U. courses, to which he invites guest lecturers like the Coen brothers and Wes Anderson. Mr. Monda played himself in a brief scene in “The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.” “Sometimes directors ask me to appear in their films,” he said. “I never say no.”        
He does seem custom-built for the part of the Italian intellectual, erudite yet effusive, bounding from one topic to the next: the short stories of Isaac Bashevis Singer, the religious themes coiled inside the subversive films of Pier Paolo Pasolini, the curious parallels between Italian and Jewish-American literature, each founded on “the unique relationship with religion, with culture, with aristocracy.”        
It is his fondness for big subjects, and his talent for putting intellectuals at ease, that inspired Mr. Monda’s best-known public event, the annual Conversazioni he and his close friend Davide Azzolini, an arts and events organizer, present each June on Capri.

The round-robin stage of the world championships in Bali, Indonesia, is just past the halfway mark, 12 of 21 rounds. With eight teams to qualify for the quarterfinals, five of the six United States teams are in the top eight.        


In the Venice Cup, USA-2 is second and USA-1 third. In the Bermuda Bowl, USA-1 is sixth. USA-2 is 11th, but less than half a match behind eighth. In the d’Orsi Senior Trophy, USA-2 is third and USA-1 eighth. The Canadian Venice Cup team is eighth; that country’s other two teams will need a strong finish.        
The diagramed deal was Board 8 in the third round, in a meeting of two favorites for the Venice Cup, France and USA-2.        
At the first table, Bénédicte Cronier (North for France) opened two diamonds, showing any game-forcing hand. Sylvie Willard (South) responded two hearts, indicating a hand that was either bad, or good and unbalanced. North chose to rebid two no-trump, so South transferred into hearts, then jumped to five hearts to invite a slam. Understandably, North passed.        
With the 3-3 trump break, South lost only two heart tricks.        
When you are in the zone, you find successful bids — as Jill Meyers (South) did in the given auction. Migry Zur-Campanile (North) opened two clubs, and South responded two hearts, promising a five-card or longer suit headed by at least two of the top three honors. Then, after North rebid three clubs, South found the winning continuation of three diamonds. North raised, then used Roman Key Card Blackwood. South’s five-club reply denied a key card.        
North then bid six diamonds, which was the only makable slam.        
West led a spade. Declarer won with dummy’s queen, cashed the club ace and king, and ruffed a club. When the queen appeared, South drew trumps and claimed. But even if a defender had started with queen-fourth of clubs, declarer would have been all right if the spades were 4-3.        
Minus 450 and plus 920 gave 10 international match points to USA-2 en route to victory by 12 imps.

NATIONAL HARBOR, Maryland — The U.S.-led effort to train the Afghan air force faces big challenges ranging from security threats to possible repercussions from procurement scandals that have triggered a review of infrastructure and equipment projects, the U.S. general in charge said.        


""This is a hard deal. We're far from 100-percent guaranteed on delivery,"" said Air Force Brigadier General John Michel, who leads NATO Air Training Command Afghanistan, which is due to complete its training of the Afghan air force by December 31, 2017 - three years after most U.S. forces leave Afghanistan.        
The one-star general cited progress in training and planning for Afghanistan to assume control over the air force but said many factors were outside his control.        
Michel spoke to Reuters this week during the annual Air Force Association conference here.        
He said the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force was re-examining all infrastructure projects after a report that one $37 million (23 million pounds) aviation facility may have been used to store opium.        
The Pentagon also has opened a criminal investigation into the Army aviation unit that awarded contracts for maintaining and overhauling Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters.        
Michel said Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, who heads ISAF, was trying to insulate the training command from any fallout from the procurement problems.        
""If they downscale some of our infrastructure (and cut aircraft), there's a degrading effect on our capacity,"" he said. ""All of these become impediments to our success while we fight the clock.""        
Michel, who arrived on the job seven weeks ago, said about 70 percent of the hangars, taxiways and other infrastructure needed to support the air force, which is due to expand to around 8,000 people from 7,000, were completed.        
But he said he fears the remaining 30 percent might never get built if problems identified in a recent report by the Special Inspector General For Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) lead to project cancellations.        
""You have to have concrete and buildings to operate from,"" he said.        
'SMALL BUT MIGHTY'        
The training mission is being led by 649 U.S. military advisers, contractors and advisers from other NATO forces. Their ranks will swell to 1,114 over the next two years after four Lockheed Martin Corp C-130 cargo planes and 20 A29 Super Tucano planes built by Sierra Nevada Corp arrive.        
A dozen Mi-17 helicopters are also expected in coming weeks, Michel said.        
The NATO advisers are helping Afghans develop the skills to operate, maintain, develop budgets for and manage what Michel calls a self-sustaining, ""small but mighty"" air force.        
Afghani pilots will be trained to carry out missions, respond to natural disasters, and evacuate casualties in a mountainous country that still lacks roads and other forms transportation.        
One of the biggest challenges has been ensuring that about half the force learns English, Michel said, noting that recruiting was difficult in a country where literacy in native languages was at just 31 percent.        
Michel's unit now runs seven English courses, serving about 420 students at any given time.        
Security at six training sites in Afghanistan is another worry, with attacks or threats setting back training efforts and forcing trainers to reinforce security, he said.        
""The more we have to do those kind of (security) missions, the more we have to degrade training,"" he said.        
A longer-term concern is whether the Afghan military can afford the estimated $600 million to $620 million a year it will cost to run the air force.        
That question, Michel says, could have big implications for the training effort, and is being debated by Dunford, the Marine Corps general, and Afghan leaders.        
""We're going to consume 15 to 20 percent of their budget. We need to know today if that's sustainable,"" Michel said.        
Despite the challenges, he said the Afghan air force was flourishing in many respects.        
A casualty evacuation that once took three days can now be executed in three to four hours, and Afghan pilots recently evacuated 300 villagers threatened by major flooding, Michel said.        
The air force is also laying the groundwork for the emergence of an Afghan aviation sector and the related infrastructure that will help Afghanistan attract foreign investment, he said.        
""Aviation opens you to the world,"" Michel said. ""It seeds the investment that Afghanistan is going to need to really flourish going forward.""

More than one-third of Libya’s oil production has come back on line in recent days after a striking militia opened the valves on a critical pipeline between two major western oil fields and Mediterranean port terminals outside the capital, Tripoli.        


Protests and strikes by militant groups that overthrew the Libyan dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi reduced Libya’s oil production to 10 percent of its capacity in recent weeks, pushing up global oil prices and threatening to make Prime Minister Ali Zeidan’s weak interim government look impotent.        
Libyan oil executives said it was not clear whether the lifting of the strike by the Zintan tribal militia was the result of a negotiated settlement with the government or simply a short-term expression of good will or a negotiating tactic. The parliament recently voted to increase the salaries of civil servants, which include oil facility guards, and government officials have threatened to arrest strike leaders.        
With the pipeline open, a critical source of oil is flowing again to the global market. But no resolution appears near to the more intractable strikes at export terminals and oil fields on the eastern side of the country, where the remaining two-thirds of the nation’s oil production is based.        
Oil production was expected to reach 700,000 barrels by the end of the week, up from a low of 150,000 barrels early this month. Normal output is 1.6 million barrels a day.        
David L. Goldwyn, the State Department coordinator for international energy affairs in the first Obama administration, said the reopening of the western oil fields represented “a little bit of success.” But he said Saudi Arabia, which has been pumping at record levels in recent weeks, could lower its production now to keep prices stable. “I don’t think you are going to get much of a softening of prices.”        
Libya, which has Africa’s largest proven reserves, is an important source of high quality oil for European refineries. Its production peaked at 3.3 million barrels a day in 1970 and has since shrunk by half. A recovery is possible since much of the country has not been explored and large shale oil fields have not even been tested. But foreign investment and expertise will be needed.        
Libyan oil and government officials have tried to reassure nervous foreign oil companies with promises of action to end the strikes. “We will soon overcome these problems and hiccups,” Nuri Berruien, the chairman of the national oil company, told an oil conference this week.        
Officials have also suggested that they are considering ways to make the country’s investment terms more appealing to foreign oil companies to attract bids at an auction for exploration rights. The auction, scheduled for the middle of next year, would be the first since the revolution in 2011.        
But there are no guarantees that there will be bidders. Foreign oil company executives have expressed concern over the ability of the government to provide security for their workers when it relies on the very militias that are supporting the strikers. On Tuesday, Exxon Mobil said it was cutting back its staff and operations in the country because of the security situation.        
The well-armed Zintan militia, which has been a constant thorn for the central government, has backed strikers demanding back pay for guarding western oil fields and critical pipelines. At a festival on Monday, its leaders promised to open the valves on a critical pipeline connecting the El-Sharara and El-Feel oil fields with the Zawiya and Mellitah export terminals that mostly supply southern Europe.        
But oil and security experts say Mr. Zeidan’s problems are far from over in the eastern part of the country where militias are demanding virtual self-rule.        
“You can more easily take care of the western concerns, which are about jobs and money, than the eastern concerns, which are about politics and regional autonomy,” said Geoff D. Porter, the head of North Africa Risk Consulting. “The objective of the east is to change the structure of the government, which the government is not going to do.”

Whenever Michael Carl, the fashion market director at Vanity Fair, goes out to dinner with friends, he plays something called the “phone stack” game: Everyone places their phones in the middle of the table; whoever looks at their device before the check arrives picks up the tab.        


Brandon Holley, the former editor of Lucky magazine, had trouble ditching her iPhone when she got home from work. So about six months ago, she began tossing her phone into a vintage milk tin the moment she walked in. It remains there until after dinner.        
And Marc Jacobs, the fashion designer, didn’t want to sleep next to a beeping gizmo. So he banned digital devices from his bedroom, a house rule he shared with audiences during a recent screening of “Disconnect,” a film that dramatizes how technology has alienated people from one other.        
As smartphones continue to burrow their way into our lives, and wearable devices like Google Glass threaten to erode our personal space even further, overtaxed users are carving out their own device-free zones with ad hoc tricks and life hacks.        
Whether it’s a physical barrier (no iPads at the dinner table) or a conceptual one (turn off devices by 11 p.m.), users say these weaning techniques are improving their relationships — and their sanity.        
“Disconnecting is a luxury that we all need,” said Lesley M. M. Blume, a New York writer who keeps her phone away from the dinner table at home. “The expectation that we must always be available to employers, colleagues, family: it creates a real obstacle in trying to set aside private time. But that private time is more important than ever.”        
Much of the digital detoxing is centered on the home, where urgent e-mails from co-workers, texts from friends, Instagram photos from acquaintances and YOLO updates on Facebook conspire to upend domestic tranquillity.        
A popular tactic is to designate a kind of cellphone lockbox, like the milk tin that Ms. Holley uses. “If my phone is buzzing or lighting up, it’s still a distraction, so it goes in the box,” said Ms. Holley, who lives in a row house in Red Hook, Brooklyn, with her son, Smith, and husband, John. “It’s not something I want my kid to see.”        
An empty fishbowl, which sits on a dining room credenza, serves a similar function for Jaime David, a publicist at the Starworks Group in New York, except there are consequences for violators. “If someone picks up the phone between 6:30 and 8:30 p.m. without a really good reason, they are tasked with getting our son to bed,” said Ms. David, who lives in Maplewood, N.J., with her husband, Jon, and two sons, Milo, 4, and Jack, 10 months.        
Others assign a digital curfew. “No screens after 11 p.m.,” said Ari Melber, a host of MSNBC’s “The Cycle,” who lives in a walk-up apartment in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, with his fiancée, Drew Grant, a pop culture reporter at The New York Observer. The rule was instituted in January, after a vacation in Honduras where the couple found themselves without Internet access and ultimately happy about it.        
“We found the evenings were more relaxing, and we were sleeping better,” Mr. Melber said.        
Sleep is a big factor, which is why some, like Mr. Jacobs, draw the gadget-free line at the bedroom. “I don’t want to sleep next to something that is a charged ball of information with photos and e-mails,” said Peter Som, the fashion designer, who keeps his phone plugged in in the living room overnight. “It definitely is a head-clearer and delineates daytime and sleep time.”        
Households with young children are especially mindful about being overconnected, with parents sensitive to how children may imitate bad habits.        
Rebecca Minkoff, a fashion designer, makes a point of turning off the ringers and leaving her two phones on the opposite end of her Dumbo apartment when she plays with her 2-year-old son, Luca. “It isn’t easy, but I do my best to make the few hours I have with my son cellphone-free until he goes to sleep,” Ms. Minkoff said.

He is the Famous Greenwich Village Leprechaun Handyman, or so the small sign on Colin Ryan’s toolbox proclaims.        


“Have tools, will travel,” the sign reads. Sometimes that means lugging his tools into Manhattan walk-ups to hang curtain rods, or hopping the subway to Queens to tile a bathroom, or catching a ride upstate to throw a deck onto a country home.        
But most work for Mr. Ryan, 62, comes from right here in the Village, where he was born and raised, and where he remains a fixture as a freelance carpenter. This time of year, there is no shortage of work.        
“All summer, people are out at their summer homes talking about stuff they want done in their apartments, and now they’re back and having it done,” said Mr. Ryan, who is rarely without his heavy toolbox-on-wheels bearing his leprechaun logo sign.        
“This has always been my neighborhood, so everybody knows me,” he said on Tuesday while refinishing a wooden stairway for a customer on Spring Street. “My customers can just throw me a key and say, ‘O.K., Colin, go to work, I’ll be back later.’ ”        
But in true leprechaun fashion, he can be tricky to catch. He has no storefront or Web site, and the cellphone number on his fliers is sometimes switched off for nonpayment.        
Best to try his base of operations: a small stoop across the street from the Blue Note jazz club on West Third Street near Avenue of the Americas, where he can often be found roosting between jobs and scrounging up beer money by laying out an overturned yellow hard hat with a sign reading, “Leprechaun Relief Fund.”        
“I don’t need no pot of gold — just enough for beer and cigarettes and subway fare,” he said, in his gravelly voice. “I’m happy for every day I’m above ground.”        
Mr. Ryan stands 5 feet 5 inches above ground, and he is usually dressed in work boots, jeans and a work shirt. He keeps a tape measure on his belt and a flat carpenter’s pencil tucked in his Vietnam Veteran cap.        
Mr. Ryan, who ran a Navy river patrol boat in the Mekong Delta in 1973, learned firsthand how tough it was to find a job as a service member returning from war. So when the repair jobs are big enough, he shares the work with fellow veterans, including younger ones who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.        
“I help out veterans coming home who aren’t immediately hirable, and also older vets,” he said. “Any of them I would trust with my life. They’re reliable and they know how to follow orders, which is important because I’m still the senior officer. No one outranks me on the job site.”        
Mr. Ryan grew up on Macdougal Street, and even while attending elementary school at St. Anthony of Padua church on Sullivan Street, he was washing beer mugs in local bars around Bleecker Street, where he would later participate in the constant jam sessions, wheeling his Hammond B3 organ from club to club, he said.        
As a teenager, he worked as a busboy and then a kosher cook in Catskill hotels, and he also did carpentry work on Fire Island. After crewing on the ferries there, he earned his captain’s license, which helped qualify him to become a quartermaster on his gunboat in Vietnam. Enemy fire eventually left him with head and leg wounds, and a Purple Heart, he said.        
The Spring Street customer, Katya Salkinder, a psychotherapist, said she liked Mr. Ryan’s $25-an-hour rate and his stories.        
“But the best thing about him is that he’s available,” she said. A grimacing Mr. Ryan struck a pinup girl pose and squealed, “Yes, darling, I’m always available!”        
Mr. Ryan, who has two grown daughters, has a house and wood shop upstate near Liberty but spends most of his time in the Village, staying with friends.        
By 9 on Tuesday night, sleeping options in the neighborhood seemed scant, so he wound up reaching an old rabbi buddy in Borough Park, Brooklyn. He would stash his tools at a friendly parking garage and hop the subway out there. No problem for a fellow with the wiles of a fairy and the survival skills of a gunboat quartermaster.        
“I’m going with Plan B,” he said, in his gravelly voice. “I haven’t survived this long without having a Plan B.”

Karbido means “free choice” in Polish, according to the musicians performing in “The Table,”  part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Next Wave Festival. And it’s an appropriate name for this group from Wroclaw, Poland, which at first glance seems to use rudimentary tools — knives, coins, wineglasses, a metal bowl — to create percussive sounds. For visual flavor, a candle appears.        


Such mundane objects are their instruments — even the wood table at which four band members sit. But you soon realize that it is no unassuming piece of furniture. Along some of its sides are mounted strings, which can be played like a horizontal bass; at times, a bow is applied to them for cello-like strains. In shadow, beneath it, are foot pedals, enabling the onstage players (Pawel Czepulkowski, Michal Litwiniec, Igor Gawlikowski and Marek Otwinowski, who goes by maot) to create a range of sound treatments.        
Lending acoustic warmth is the intimate interior of the academy’s Fishman Space, which practically serves as one more instrument. The band’s four-channel sound system adds spatial complexity to the numbers, which can encompass busy polyrhythms and long, lyrical swells as they wander stylistically among ambient jazz, Belarussian folk and aboriginal and Middle Eastern idioms.        
There is tension. And magic. And humor: When a knife was dropped, the members silently stood and congratulated one another with handshakes.        
 At the end of the performance, the quartet at the table were joined by the lighting designer and programmer Tomasz Sikora and the sound designer Jacek Fedorowicz. They deserve the recognition. But for all the fancy electronic embellishments, “The Table” manages to retain its own very human heartbeat.        



 
“The Table” runs through  Sunday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Fishman Space at BAM Fisher, 321 Ashland Place, Fort Greene; (718) 636-4100, bam.org.

Almost since its opening in 1939, the 92nd Street Y’s Unterberg Poetry Center has been the Carnegie Hall of American literary life, host to just about everybody who was anybody, and site of more than one dramatic evening. But who knew that the Y once tried to book a poetry reading by Mao Zedong?        


“I have written to Chairman Mao,” Grace Schulman, the center’s director at the time, wrote to one of his translators in 1974, two years after President Richard M. Nixon’s visit to China.        
She went on to describe the skeptical reaction she received from “a poet named Chang” at the United Nations: “After telling him my plan, and how important it was for Chairman Mao to read his poems aloud, I heard him laugh uncontrollably for quite some time. But I still hope Mao will come.”        
Mao didn’t come. But Ms. Schulman’s letter, unearthed during a scouring of the poetry center’s archives in preparation for a 75th-anniversary season that begins this month, stands as one of the more quixotic episodes in the center’s long commitment to the live literary voice.        
During the anniversary season, that literary voice can be heard, as usual, onstage. It can also be sampled on the Internet, thanks to “75 at 75,” a series pairing 75 recordings from the poetry center’s audio archive — it contains more than 2,000 readings — with specially commissioned essays.        
And starting on Sept. 25, “Love the Words,” an exhibition, will be in the Y’s lobby gallery. It draws on previously unseen photos and rare correspondence from the likes of T. S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas and Robert Lowell to illuminate the center’s role in New York’s literary history.        
These days, it can seem like every bookstore, bar and bowling alley in the city has been taken over by writers seeking to read their work in public. But when the poetry center opened its doors in 1939, with a lineup including William Carlos Williams, W. H. Auden and Langston Hughes, the idea that live performance was an essential part of a writer’s job was new.        
“This just wasn’t part of what writers did at the time,” Bernard Schwartz, the center’s director, said during a recent preview of materials from the archives. “They treated the occasion as more than business as usual,” he added.        
Today, an invitation to read at the Y, many writers say, arrives like a quasi-divine summons.        
“The mother of all lecterns,” the poet Billy Collins said recently, when asked to describe the Y’s more-than-900-seat Kaufmann Hall, ringed with names like Aristotle, Maimonides and Shakespeare, spelled out in gold leaf.        
“When you read there, you’re aware that just about every writer you’ve ever admired has gone before you,” said the playwright Tony Kushner, who began attending readings at the Y as an undergraduate at Columbia in the 1970s. “You don’t feel like you’re being judged. You feel like you’ve already been judged.”        
“Love the Words,” put together by Mr. Schwartz and Ava Lehrer, contains plenty such testimonials, along with glimpses of less high-minded aspects of the enterprise. Truman Capote, in 1964, asked if the center could up the standard honorarium — still “modest” today, according to Mr. Schwartz — to $1,000. (Leonard Cohen, invited the following year, said he was happy with $100.) And when the elderly Robert Frost gave a reading, ushers were dispatched to fill empty seats.        
“I am in the position to watch the madness of old age eating away some of the old poets and composers,” Elizabeth Kray, the center’s director at the time, wrote in 1960 to the poet Donald Hall. “One outward sign is their desire for public attention. With Mr. Frost, this is a mania.”        
Marianne Moore, by contrast, said in a 1964 letter that she would read only if there were no “ ‘hero’ atmosphere,” declaring, “It’s regulation or nothing.” (For her, regulation meant wearing a tricorn hat and Paul Revere-ish jacket, shown in a photograph included in the show.)        
Elizabeth Bishop declined the Y’s invitations for decades — “I suffer too much, and I don’t think people enjoy seeing someone miserable,” she wrote in 1950 — then requested that a recording of her first reading there, in 1973, be destroyed. (It was, though two other Bishop readings survive in the center’s collection.)        
The Y, whose lineup today is heavier on novelists than poets, has also coaxed some notably retiring prose writers into the limelight. Don DeLillo gave his first reading for the general public there, in 1990. “I’m glad it’s over,” he wrote in a note afterward. (He has since done three more readings at the Y.)        
The center has long been known for its onstage pairings, which this season include Allan Gurganus and Donna Tartt, Colum McCann and Norman Rush, and Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt, who first met at the Y in 1981 and have been a couple ever since.        
“Love the Words” also does some sly matchmaking of its own. On one wall, a photograph of Norman Mailer during a 1961 reading (which ended when the center’s director brought the curtain down during a recitation of obscene couplets) hangs alongside a portrait of Cynthia Ozick, who, in an encounter preserved on YouTube, stood up at a 1971 panel discussion on feminism to ask the macho Mr. Mailer what color his ink ran after he dipped his testicles.        
That confrontation took place at Town Hall, but Ms. Ozick said at the time that she had always fantasized about asking him that question “at the Y.”        
“We thought they belonged next to each other,” Mr. Schwartz said.

Mark Golin was in his office at the Time-Life Building recently, reflecting on his go-go days as the editor of Maxim magazine in the late 1990s.        


“We were in a lot of ways the barbarians at the gates of Rome,” said Mr. Golin, now 51 and the group editor of style and entertainment at Time Inc., overseeing People, Entertainment Weekly and InStyle. “There you are, you’re sitting there with your city sanitation and your senate and everything,” getting beaten by “guys that don’t shower.”        
“It felt great,” he said. “It was a lot of fun.” During his time at Maxim, Mr. Golin relished playing the heel, but he says he was never the lout or the lad he was portrayed as at the time. “I play the violin,” he said. “I don’t drink beer.”        
He also doesn’t read Maxim anymore. “I’ve never read another copy since I left,” Mr. Golin said. “I never would’ve read the thing if I didn’t work there.”        
The magazine is universally credited (for what it’s worth) with encapsulating a “beer and babes” ethos that helped make careers for people like Megan Fox and Ashley Greene, even as it raised eyebrows and crinkled noses.        
But last week, it was sold with little fanfare for an undisclosed sum to Darden Media, whose chairman, Calvin Darden Sr., issued a statement about expanding the Maxim brand into a cable network and other platforms. He did not return calls for further comment. (The magazine’s previous owner, Alpha Media Group, bought the publication and two others, since shuttered, from Dennis Publishing for $250 million six years ago.)        
While magazines of every stripe are struggling with a decline in ad sales, it seems safe to assert that Maxim has perhaps outlived its power to provoke and titillate.        
Though he no longer reads the magazine, Mr. Golin is certain that the Maxim man is still out there. What’s changed, he suggested, is the culture that surrounds him.        
What had once been what Mr. Golin called a treehouse for a certain kind of guy, has perhaps become the forest. “Maxim expanded out to be easily found in the general fabric of everything,” Mr. Golin said. “It became expected and accepted.”        
Looking around, Mr. Golin sees signs of his former publication everywhere. “Probably one of the highest-grossing movies, or trilogy of movies, was ‘The Bachelor,’ ” he said.        
Did Mr. Golin perhaps mean “The Hangover”?        
“ ‘The Hangover,’ ‘The Hangover;’ ” he said.        
You can also see some of the Maxim man’s grasping ego in a character like Kenny Powers (played by Danny McBride), the blustery, blubbery former major league baseball pitcher on “Eastbound & Down” on HBO.        
On Fox, there’s Schmidt (played by Max Greenfield) on “New Girl,” who presents a more polished version of a ’90s-era Maxim guy, and who embodies the kind of behavior derided by Susan Faludi in her 2000 book “Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,” in which she called Maxim “simpering and sneaky” and described it as “a last blast of anachronistic masculinity.” Schmidt dresses as if he just walked out of a spread in Details, but his roommates force him to put a dollar into a jar every time he blurts out another sexist or self-regarding comment.        
Then there’s Will Ferrell, whose every character from Ricky Bobby to Ron Burgundy to George W. Bush channels the wounded pride of overgrown boys living through what’s been called “the end of men.”        
“I think ultimately Maxim won,” Mr. Golin said, adding that the sophomoric are now found in great abundance on the Internet, which makes a monthly magazine of humor and innuendo less necessary.        
Intended as a raspberry in the face of political correctness, Maxim was an overnight success following its transplantation from Britain by its owner, Felix Dennis. If National Review famously aimed to stand “athwart history, yelling Stop,” Maxim keg-stood the era of identity politics and Antioch consent rules. Its combination of “lad” humor, PG-13 starlet ogling and service articles upended its category, inspiring its competitors like GQ, Esquire and Details to change their formulas.

Carla Kaplan, a professor of American literature at Northeastern University, offers a joint biography of six largely forgotten women (winnowed down from five dozen whom she researched) in “Miss Anne in Harlem: The White Women of the Black Renaissance” (Harper, $28.99).        


The convention-bending women included philanthropists, educators, heiresses and novelists who figured in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s as patrons, muses and editors and in assorted other roles that Professor Kaplan, a biographer of the writer Zora Neale Hurston, captivatingly illuminates and places in overdue perspective.        
“We have documented every other imaginable form of female identity in the Jazz Age — the New Woman, the spinster, the flapper, the Gibson Girl, the bachelor girl, the bohemian, the twenties ‘mannish’ lesbian, the suffragist, the invert and so on,” she writes. “But until now, the full story of the white women of black Harlem, the women collectively referred to as ‘Miss Anne,’ has never been told.”        
Professor Kaplan tells it engagingly, highlighting her subjects’ decisions to embrace blackness and repudiate their own whiteness — and the rewards and costs of their modern rebellion.

“We have enough police here to stop a revolution,” Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine declared outside Madison Square Garden on Feb. 20, 1939. What was going on inside might have been far short of revolutionary, but it was nonetheless revolting: 22,000 Nazi sympathizers celebrating Hitler’s Germany and castigating President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his “Jew Deal.”        
In “Swastika Nation: Fritz Kuhn and the Rise and Fall of the German-American Bund” (St. Martin’s Press, $27.99), Arnie Bernstein tells the story of the German-born Kuhn, who hoped to replace the United States government with a fascist dictatorship, and the real-life crusade of eccentric and unlikely allies that stopped him. After managing to infuriate his own followers and his fellow Americans, Kuhn ended up in prison for embezzlement and was booted back to Germany after the war.        
Mr. Bernstein takes Kuhn’s campaign personally. The author was a high school student in Skokie, Ill., in the 1970s when neo-Nazis planned a march in the Chicago suburb, where about one in six Jews was a Holocaust survivor or related to one.        
“Kuhn was denaturalized and deported — but there is no invention to delouse him,” Walter Winchell wrote in 1945. In this engrossing retelling, Winchell figured with Thomas E. Dewey, Fiorello H. La Guardia, a Manhattan congressman on the payroll of the Soviet spy agency and assorted gangsters to help Kuhn undo himself.

Luckily, the book complements a current exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York, so readers who cannot find a copy can see Ms. Ruttenberg’s mystical and inventive works in person at Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street — and maybe take in a bit of nearby Central Park on the way.

Q. The unusual building at 1782 Third Avenue, at 99th Street, is listed as “Substation 7” on the National Register of Historic Places, but I can’t find any information about it. Why is it historic? 


A. It’s a link to the els.        
Joseph J. Cunningham, an engineering historian and an authority on New York City’s electrical power systems, said that this particular substation was one of seven buildings that provided power to the elevated trains operated by the Manhattan Railway Company on Second, Third, Sixth and Ninth Avenues.        
The electrification project, which began in 1898, had its source in the main power station at 74th Street and the East River, Mr. Cunningham said in an e-mail. There were three substations on each side of Manhattan and one in the Bronx.        
The function of the substations was to receive 11,000-volt alternating current from the power house and convert it to 625-volt direct current for the third-rail distribution system to the trains. The power station and substations began operating in late 1901, and all trains were running by electric power by the spring of 1903.        
So why is Substation 7 historic? “My supposition would be that it is because it is the last that resembles the original structure,” Mr. Cunningham said. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, the first major subway line, leased the Manhattan Railway Company in 1903 and their power systems were interconnected, he said. Some substations were replaced; others remained until the els were demolished.        
No. 7 was the primary supply of power for the upper portion of the Lexington Avenue subway from 1918 into at least the late 1970s, when other substations were constructed underground. “Therefore it never became a commercial structure, but was retained for other transit-related work, such as storage or field crew space,” he said. It is still owned by M.T.A. New York City Transit.        
By comparison, he said, Substation 2, the only remaining substation for the els on the West Side, was reused as a hardware and lumber store.        
While there are numerous retired substations that were built solely for the subways, and many that date from the days of direct-current utility power for residential and commercial customers, No. 7 is the only Manhattan substation that dates from the electrification of the pre-subway elevated system and also retains its original appearance, Mr. Cunningham said.        
Q. Is there a rule covering the maximum length of a dog leash in the city? 
A. Yes. When a dog in any public place is required to be on a leash — the normal situation — the maximum allowable length of the leash or other restraint is six feet.        
The parks department allows many exceptions to the leash law on parks property: for example, enclosed dog runs where dogs are permitted to run off-leash; and designated parks with no dog runs but off-leash hours from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and then from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.        
A list of all of the parks that either have off-leash hours or have dog runs can be found at: nyc.gov/parks/dogs.

To the Editor: 


Re “Pope Says Church Is ‘Obsessed’ With Gays, Abortion, Birth Control” (front page, Sept. 20):        
As a child raised Catholic and a mature adult who chose to leave that tradition, I find myself cheering Pope Francis in his attempts to breathe fresh air into the suffocating atmosphere that surrounds him at the Vatican. The question is: Will he change the Vatican, or will it change him?        
It will be interesting to see if one man — will it ever be one woman? — can make a difference in a mammoth organization like the Roman Catholic Church that is founded on hierarchical policies and practices.        
This man needs to hear from those who share his views. And he needs to be encouraged to open his eyes, mind and heart to all the abuses and oppressions still perpetrated by the church he loves.        
He has a long way to go, but it sounds as if Pope Francis is on the right path.

To the Editor: 
Pope Francis’s shift in direction induces nostalgia. His love of people and messages of hope and healing are what childhood Catholic education and upbringing are grounded in.        
I have no memories of any of my hometown priests’ talking about abortion, homosexuality or contraception, but many memories of their talking about love, acceptance and forgiveness. I think that most Catholics are seeing a shift in church leadership back toward the principles that shaped us into the adults we are.

As an American who is happily Catholic, I have devoted considerable effort to combating elective legalized abortion. In light of Pope Francis’s recommendation to focus on the person, I would encourage him to do just that and do all that he can to protect the life of the human person from conception to natural death.        
There is no more pressing moral issue, and no more pressing human rights issue.

To the Editor: 
We welcome Pope Francis’s desire to find “a new balance” within the Catholic Church and ensure that it is truly a “home for all.”        
The recognition that the church is out of step with modern times could not come at a better moment: with world leaders set to discuss at the United Nations the framework for the next global development agenda, the health and rights of women and young people must be prioritized. That means ensuring access to comprehensive sexuality education, contraception and safe abortion services — necessities that the Vatican has vehemently opposed.        
We hope that this is one step forward in making violations of reproductive and sexual rights a thing of the past.

To the Editor: 
As a former Catholic who became disgusted with the church’s insane focus on sex while poverty and injustice and financial crime thrived, I am relieved to see that Pope Francis appears to be a voice of sanity.        
I hope that he lives long and his influence prevails. There are many Catholics who are more like Francis than Benedict, but in the last 30 years only the strident voices of the right-wingers in the church have been given the megaphone.        
It’s probably too late for me, but maybe my children will want to attend such a church.        
MARY H. CLARKE Nashville, Sept. 20, 2013        
         
To the Editor: 
I think this is merely a pragmatic attempt to enlarge the Catholic Church by creating a “big tent.” There is a realization that the church is shrinking and will continue to do so if nothing changes.        
The risk is that conservatives become alienated and fracture from the main body. Thus far, those losses have been small compared with those who leave because of ambivalence or who go to evangelical Protestant churches.

Just a few months ago it seemed that Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI had ensured that they would be succeeded, perhaps for generations to come, by men who shared their painfully cramped view of the church. Who would have thought it possible that a man of Pope Francis’s profound insight and inclusive vision would be elected to restore the church’s fading relevance in the modern world?

DALLAS — AT&T has closed on its $780 million acquisition of Atlantic Tele-Network Inc., a wireless phone operator that operates under the Alltel brand with 590,000 subscribers.        
The network covers about 4.5 million mostly rural residents in Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina and South Carolina.        
AT&T says it will begin upgrading the network and will roll out its ""4G LTE"" service in former Alltel areas by late 2014.        
Dallas-based AT&T Inc. will release its third-quarter results on Oct. 23. It said Friday that it expects to show growth its smartphone base by 1 million in the quarter, with higher smartphone upgrades than a year earlier, followed by a year-over-year decline in upgrades in the fourth quarter.

MILAN — When Stuart Weitzman decided to close his shoe box of a store on the Via della Spiga here and open a fancy new “international flagship” in the heart of Milan’s shopping district, he had three architects in mind: Frank Gehry, Santiago Calatrava or Zaha Hadid.        


Mr. Weitzman likes to think big.        
This is the quirky 71-year-old shoe designer who, for many years before the recession, liked to make a splash at the Oscars with his $1 million diamond-encrusted heels, which, at the risk of appearing tacky, never failed to get attention. Last year, he hired Kate Moss to appear in his advertising campaigns. And people started to think of Stuart Weitzman, who has been designing sophisticated but not terribly expensive shoes in New York since he worked for his father’s factory in the 1960s, as a luxury brand.        
So he wanted the Milan store to make a statement, that Mr. Weitzman was right up there with Ferragamo, Gucci and Prada, even though most of his designs are much less expensive.        
Only the architects acted as if they had never heard of him.        
It took several cold calls to Ms. Hadid’s London office before anyone would agree to hear Mr. Weitzman’s pitch, and only then, he said: “I got to her heart through her feet. Women love shoes.”        
So there, at the opening party on the Via Sant’Andrea on Thursday night, was Ms. Moss, wearing a black pantsuit and a big smile as she breezed through a store designed by Ms. Hadid as if it were the interior of a spaceship. Mr. Weitzman’s signature over-the-knee boots and his new men’s-inspired pumps (many priced under $400) were aligned on curving, swirling displays made of fiberglass with a rose-gold trim, with suede seats built at odd angles into the displays. The gray walls curved inward, like a cave, making it hard for guests to stand if they ventured too close to the sides.        
“The shoe business is so much more elevated today,” said Mr. Weitzman, standing off to the side of the party, which had spilled out into a garden behind the store. “Women always had to have them, but shoes were never as much a part of their personalities as they are today. It’s much more democratic.”        
At that moment, a security guard tapped Mr. Weitzman on the shoulder and told him to move along, as Ms. Moss was standing nearby. But he was on the list!        
As many women will attest, Mr. Weitzman is a remarkable shoe designer, and, in fact, his fit model said that he will spend hours going over the placement of straps to make sure there is not the slightest bump against the foot. He has been designing over-the-knee boots called 5050 (they are leather in the front, stretch fabric in the back) for 20 years, and still he featured the design, which costs $598, in his fall campaign, again with Ms. Moss. They are again a top seller for the company.        
Like the boots, successful fashion is half product and half perception.        
“The brand has gone from starting out as a shoemaker to being a part of fashion,” he said.        
Ms. Hadid, who is known for her futuristic architecture, has previously designed stores for Neil Barrett and an art pavilion for Chanel. (She also has recently designed shoes for United Nude and Melissa Shoes, but that is another story.)        
“I like shoes,” she said in a telephone interview. “And I do think retail is really interesting. You often have department stores with very expensive clothes and only one mirror where you cannot see anything. Maybe it’s a trick.”        
Her design for Mr. Weitzman is filled with reflective surfaces, and the seats are made with space for a woman to place her bag next to her, rather than on the floor. The idea was to propel a customer from the street right into the displays.        
“Stores are becoming bigger now,” Ms. Hadid said. “They have to compete with online. And there is another aspect of shopping, which is entertainment. You need that.”        
Mr. Weitzman has more than 100 stores around the world, including 3 others in Italy. A quarter of the company’s annual sales, which total about $350 million, come from its own retail business, so Mr. Weitzman, who sold the label to the Jones Group in 2010, said it was important to create a new concept to entice shoppers. Ms. Hadid’s store design will be recreated in five other locations, including a New York store next year.        
“It is as much for our peers as it is for our customers,” Mr. Weitzman said. “Stores like this have opened up the eyes of retailers around the world to our brand. They are like advertisements to other people in our industry.”        
A store next to Chanel on an exclusive retail strip of Milan sends a powerful message. So does having Ms. Moss as the star attraction at your party, watching a video of herself walking in your boots.        
“We’re never going to sell enough shoes from that image to pay for that one ad,” Mr. Weitzman said. “But people notice.”

Re “A Decade of Goodbye,” by Joan Marans Dim (Op-Ed, Sept. 19):        
My husband, Alan, recently died at age 69 of Alzheimer’s disease, and I, too, reflected back on the last decade of our life together. His descent into the abyss of dementia was truly awful, and we were denied the one thing that Ms. Dim and her husband were able to accomplish — to say goodbye to each other.        
There was one last moment of clarity between us two years before his death, during an intense conversation in which he told of his sorrow at my having to take care of him. We expressed our love for each other, and I told him I knew that if the roles had been reversed, he would have done the same for me. I guessed that there would not be any more conversations like that in the future, and I was right.        
Alan loved life and tried everything to safeguard his health and well-being, but it was futile. Although his passing was peaceful, I still wish we could have said goodbye.

Re “Caught in the Hipster Trap” (Sunday Review, Sept. 15):        
Steven Kurutz is spot on about how hipsterdom has colonized fashions that some of us have always worn simply because, well, that’s what we do.        
I have ridden a bike for decades, and to keep my trousers out of the chain, I’ve rolled up the cuffs, sometimes forgetting to unroll them again afterward. My children and others have ridiculed me, and I just assumed that, like T. S. Eliot’s Prufrock, “I grow old ... I grow old ... / I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.”        
Now I look around, and voilà! Bikers everywhere, with factory-made turn-ups on their pants.

Stanley A. Plotkin is right that the Lyme disease vaccine was an effective component of efforts to protect the public against exposure (“Bring Back the Lyme Vaccine,” Op-Ed, Sept. 19).        
Rather than simply bringing back the discontinued vaccine, however, the federal government and industry should be supporting efforts to develop a vaccine against the blacklegged tick. This tick (formerly called the deer tick) transmits not only the Lyme disease bacterium, but also the agents that cause babesiosis, anaplasmosis and Powassan viral encephalitis.        
People who get vaccinated only against Lyme disease might relax their vigilance against ticks and become more vulnerable to these other tick-borne illnesses, which are rapidly emerging in several parts of the United States. Progress has been made in developing vaccines that cause our immune systems to attack the tick itself when it attempts to feed. Indeed, some breeds of cattle, and some humans, are resistant to tick bites because of inherent immunity to proteins in tick saliva.        
Aggressive pursuit of an anti-tick vaccine would protect the public against Lyme and several other widespread diseases.

Re “Wi-Fi and Cellphone Service on Subway Trains? M.T.A. Leader Says It May Happen” (news article, Sept. 18):        
As somebody who lives in an area where the trains are mostly aboveground, I can say from experience that loud cellphone conversations are rarely a problem and that when people do talk on the phone it’s usually at normal volumes. Most of the noise still comes from loud eating, crying babies and rowdy teenagers, just as it does in the underground portions of the system.        
Anyone who complains about passengers yapping away on cellphones clearly hasn’t taken the trains outside of Manhattan since cellphones were invented, if at all.

LONDON — The right-leaning populist party that has sent tremors through British politics sustained a self-inflicted setback on Friday when a senior official was disciplined after jokingly referring to women as “sluts” and hitting a television reporter on the head with a party document.        


The disciplinary action against Godfrey Bloom of the United Kingdom Independence Party, which campaigns against immigration and for Britain to leave the European Union, overshadowed a party conference here. Mr. Bloom is also a member of the European Parliament.        
Although the party has no members in Britain’s Parliament, some opinion polls suggest that it is challenging to become the country’s third-most popular party, eclipsing the Liberal Democrats, who are the junior partners in the coalition government.        
Buoyed by a series of electoral successes, the Independence Party’s leader, Nigel Farage, told the party conference that “an earthquake in British politics” would occur next year when, he predicted, the party would win more seats in European Parliament elections than any other in Britain.        
But Mr. Bloom, who made headlines nine years ago by saying that women did not clean behind the refrigerator often enough, did so again Friday when he was heard saying that a room was “full of sluts.” He said later that the comment was meant as a joke and that everyone, including the women in the room, had laughed.        
But he later reacted angrily when asked by a television reporter, Michael Crick, why there were no black faces among more than 250 photographs of party supporters on the cover of the conference agenda. Mr. Bloom accused Mr. Crick of asking a racist question and was filmed hitting him across the head with a copy of the agenda.        
The party leadership said that Mr. Bloom would be removed from his party whip post pending an investigation, which meant he would be suspended from formal involvement in party business.        
The episode could damage the credibility of the Independence Party, which has made impressive electoral gains. Some analysts say that by splitting the right-wing vote in some areas, the party is hurting the prospects of the Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, to win a majority in the next general election, due in 2015.        
Addressing the conference, Mr. Farage insisted that the party was “opposed to racism, sectarianism and extremism.” But his speech dwelled at length on European Union rules that starting in January will allow Romanians and Bulgarians without special permits to seek work in Britain. The two nations joined the European Union in 2007, and their citizens are already allowed to enter Britain freely for visits.        
“I’d come here myself if I was in their position,” Mr. Farage said. “So would you. Anyone would be tempted. In Bulgaria and Romania, average earnings are a fifth of ours.        
“London is already experiencing a Romanian crime wave,” Mr. Farage said. “There have been an astounding 27,500 arrests in the Metropolitan Police area in the last five years. Ninety-two percent of A.T.M. crime is committed by Romanians.”        
He also said that Britain “should not welcome foreign criminal gangs” and should deport offenders.        
Romania’s embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment. The Metropolitan Police said Mr. Farage’s figures were in line with theirs, which show that 7,650 Romanians were arrested in the first six months of this year, compared with 7,046 in all of 2012. Mr. Farage’s A.T.M. fraud statistic was based on an estimate given by the London police.        
Mr. Farage argued that his party has changed the contours of British politics by forcing other parties to toughen positions toward the European Union and immigration. Earlier this year Mr. Cameron said that if he were re-elected, he would renegotiate the terms of Britain’s membership in the European Union and hold a referendum in 2017 on whether to continue membership.        
Once seen as a maverick, Mr. Farage has become a rising star of British politics through plain speaking, a rejection of political correctness and a strong sense of mischief. But Peter Wilding, director of British Influence, a group campaigning to keep Britain in the Union, described Mr. Farage as “a demagogue, whipping up fear and hatred with a smile on his face and a pint in his hand.”

Re “As Deadline Nears, Taxi of Tomorrow Faces Court Fight and Reluctant Owners” (news article, Sept. 16):        
When am I going to be able to stick my hand in the air and hail a cab like anyone else instead of being stranded?        
Since the mid-’90s, when I started using a wheelchair, I’ve been shut out of this basic part of the New York City transportation system. I’ve watched thousands of cabs pass me by when all I needed was a ride to my next meeting.        
But instead of following the example of London, where wheelchair-accessible cabs were mandated in 1989, New York City chose an inaccessible van from Nissan in its Taxi of Tomorrow initiative.        
It’s infuriating: my time and the time and flexibility of the tens of thousands of other New Yorkers who use wheelchairs in the city are just as important as anyone else’s. And that figure doesn’t count the many wheelchair-using tourists and business people visiting here.        
New York City should go back to the drawing board, and if it wants to mandate a taxi, make sure that we aren’t left at the curb.

The number of civilian fire fatalities in New York City dropped drastically last year, with roughly one-third fewer deaths than in the previous year, according to a report issued by the Bloomberg administration on Friday.        


There were 46 fire fatalities in the 2013 fiscal year compared with 70 in 2012, according to the Mayor’s Management Report.        
The report, which has been issued by mayors for more than three decades, is a data bonanza. It offers a comprehensive statistical look at how every municipal agency is performing and is packed with details on how the estimated 300,000 city employees are delivering services.        
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who built a business empire and his personal fortune on the dissemination of information, has expanded the amount of detail in the reports. They now cover everything from air quality, crime and education to noise complaints, pothole reports and street cleanliness. With Mr. Bloomberg’s tenure ending soon, this is the last time he will offer such a volume.        
In addition to the drop in fire fatalities, one of the most striking statistics was the sharp rise in the number of people applying for food stamps, formally called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.        
There are 1.8 million New Yorkers receiving nutritional assistance, and the number has risen every year since 2003. It is now 124 percent higher than when Mr. Bloomberg entered office.        
In many areas, there has been a marked improvement over the mayor’s term, including a well-documented decline in violent crime.        
“New York City services have shown constant improvement over the last 12 years despite multiple economic downturns and operational challenges like Hurricane Sandy that have tested our talented and dedicated workforce,” Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement.        
City officials said the administration was particularly proud of the recent progress in reducing carbon emissions in government buildings, part of a broader effort to reduce emissions citywide by 30 percent by 2030.        
Hurricane Sandy’s continuing effects were reflected in data from a number of agencies, most notably the Department of Transportation.        
The number of streets that needed repairing jumped 40,000, to 241,572, according to the report.        
Then there are the perennial challenges that are a part of urban life, like graffiti.        
As graffiti disappeared from subways and roll-up gates went out of fashion with the drop in crime, graffiti has faded as an urgent subject or symbol of blight.        
In 2011, the responsibility for cleaning graffiti moved from the Department of Sanitation to the Economic Development Corporation.        
But for those who thought the problem was vanquished, the report offers a sobering number.        
In 2013, graffiti was scrubbed off more than four million square feet of the city’s landscape. That is the equivalent of 91 acres.

After hours of harsh questioning from a defense lawyer, the psychologist testifying for prosecutors twisted ever so slightly in the witness stand.        


How could it be, the defense lawyer had asked, that 20 other doctors examined the defendant, a Portuguese fashion model, and concluded he was in the throes of a manic episode at the time he killed his companion — and only you determined that he was faking it?        
How could it be that the rule book for your profession says a manic episode can come on rapidly — and yet you insist that the book is wrong on that point?        
And how could you conclude that the defendant, who has a degree in physical education from a college in Portugal, learned how to invent an insanity defense in a college psychology class, without having any idea whether he even took such a class?        
With that, William B. Barr shifted a bit in the witness chair. He tilted his head to one side, but he did not lose his cool.        
“It’s my assumption that getting a general degree from a university, that chances are that someone has studied psychology,” he answered calmly.        
As an expert witness, Dr. Barr is among a select group of mental health professionals in New York City who regularly play a central role in criminal proceedings, and he has become something of the go-to man for prosecutors when the mental health of a defendant is at issue. There is no record of exactly how often an expert appears for either side, but since 2000, Dr. Barr has been hired by prosecutors as a consultant in more than 100 such cases, he testified last year.        
Because they are hired largely by word of mouth among like-minded lawyers, it is all but inevitable that the same experts will be repeatedly called. Yet most try to avoid testifying more frequently for one side to avoid the appearance that they are tailoring their conclusions to the needs of the lawyers who most often hire them.        
Dr. Barr’s role is often to tell jurors that defendants who might seem mentally ill did not meet the legal definition of insanity at the moment they are said to have committed their crimes. And his testimony follows an almost predictable pattern: defendants are exaggerating a mental impairment and acted out of rage.        
His first major case was the 1999 trial of Andrew Goldstein, who pushed a young woman to her death in front of a subway train. Dr. Barr testified that Mr. Goldstein was exaggerating his mental illnesses and might actually have attention-deficit disorder. Yet under cross-examination, Dr. Barr acknowledged that he had not read Mr. Goldstein’s 3,500-page medical history, which included repeated diagnoses of schizophrenia.        
He gave similar testimony in the 2007 trial of Peter Braunstein, a former magazine writer convicted of sexually assaulting a former colleague after dressing as a firefighter to get into her apartment. Dr. Barr testified that Mr. Braunstein exaggerated symptoms of schizophrenia during testing, giving answers that were so “off the chart” that “if it was valid, it would be one of the most severe forms of schizophrenia ever observed in the world.”        
Dr. Barr’s methods, and even his mere presence in court, have become an increasing focus of trials in which he participates.        
In the trial last fall of the Portuguese fashion model, Renato Seabra, a defense lawyer, Rubin Sinins, asked Dr. Barr if he simply “cut and paste” into his report that Mr. Seabra acted out of rage.        
An expert for the defense, Dr. Roger Martin Harris, the former director of psychiatric units at several local hospitals who now teaches forensic psychiatry at New York Medical College, testified that Dr. Barr was “creating his own diagnostic system” in ignoring definitions in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, sometimes referred to as the bible of mental disorders.        
“I respectfully think that Dr. Barr is going out of his way trying to make Mr. Seabra responsible for the crime,” Dr. Harris said.

ROME — From the moment he was introduced to the huge crowds waiting for a new pope in the rain at St. Peter’s Square, Pope Francis has been a surprise. People gasped when his name was called out. He was 76, seemingly another rigid conservative, not the younger, dynamic figure many Catholics had hoped for.        


Now six months later, the surprises keep coming, including the pope’s new remarks that the church risked becoming a “small chapel” overly fixated on sexual morality and should instead offer a broader, more inclusive message.        
Francis is challenging the status quo of the Roman Catholic Church so determinedly and so unexpectedly that Vatican watchers are debating whether this is merely a change of tone, as many had thought at first. Some now think the pope may be making a deliberate effort to shake up the Vatican governing hierarchy, known as the Curia, and prepare the ground for a more fundamental shift in the direction of the church.        
“I think we are looking at major changes,” said John Thavis, a longtime Vatican observer and author of “The Vatican Diaries.” “There is a lot of disorientation inside the Roman Curia. They used to feel they were in charge. Right now, they know they are not in charge.”        
The latest unexpected jolt from Pope Francis came in an interview conducted with a Jesuit journalist and released Thursday in Jesuit publications around the world. Francis, himself a Jesuit, chastised the church’s narrow focus on controversial social issues and called instead for a more merciful and less judgmental church. He had already sent out earlier signals, declining to live in the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace, chiding prelates for driving fancy cars and announcing that church properties should be used as shelters for refugees.        
Francis did try to temper the impact of his remarks on Friday, telling an audience of Catholic gynecologists that abortion was a symptom of our “throwaway culture” and urging them to refuse to perform the procedure.        
But there seems little question that Francis wants to change the papal conversation. His predecessor, Benedict XVI, often seemed engaged in an angry verbal jousting match with secularism and modernity, usually delivered through formal encyclicals or speeches that, to many Catholics, felt like a personal rebuke. The church seemed like “a rigid institution dictating impossible norms to follow, an overly severe mother,” said Lucetta Scaraffia, a scholar of Catholicism in Rome.        
By contrast, Pope Francis has made impromptu telephone calls to people who have written him letters seeking help, while also thriving on socializing with other priests and laypeople. He is assuming the tone of the parish priest, many analysts say, recognizing that people struggle daily with issues of conscience and that the church, rather than shake a finger, must offer a broader message of comfort and healing. Many analysts have seized on an analogy cited by Francis in his interview: the church as a hospital in a battlefield.        
“People have been wounded in a war over secularization,” said Ms. Scaraffia, a history professor at the University of Rome La Sapienza. “He’s saying: ‘Let’s look after the wounds. That’s more important than winning the war.’ ”        
The deep challenges confronting the church became evident after Benedict’s stunning decision to resign early this year. Allegations of mismanagement were erupting in the Vatican, and accusations of impropriety shook the Vatican bank. Many cardinals blamed the problems on the secretive administrative body, the Roman Curia, and wanted Benedict’s successor to usher in major reforms that would decentralize power.        
Pope Francis has already signaled his independence from some of the Vatican’s traditional channels, and his biggest governance move, as yet, has been the creation of an advisory group of eight outside cardinals to help him usher in Curial reform. But in his interview, he hinted that bigger changes could be coming, including possible structural changes to the conferences of bishops, known as synods. He also pointedly warned that certain departments in the Curia, when functioning poorly, risk “becoming institutions of censorship.”

BERLIN — The man in the floppy hat and khaki vest was on his knees, pounding two small, brass-plated bricks into the wet sidewalk. One bore the name Arvid Harnack, the other of Mr. Harnack’s wife, Mildred Fish-Harnack — the only American civilian to be executed on the direct order of Adolf Hitler.        


On Friday afternoon, more than 50 people huddled under umbrellas for the commemoration ceremony on the front step of Genthinerstrasse 16, the Harnacks’ last address before being arrested by the Nazis for working with the resistance.        
The man hammering the stones into place was Gunter Demnig, a German artist who has spent years installing more than 43,000 of these so-called Stolpersteine, or “stumbling blocks,” into the sidewalks of 16 countries across Europe, making them one of the largest decentralized memorials to victims of the Third Reich. Some 5,000 of them are in Berlin alone.        
Some of the people who attended were Ms. Fish-Harnack’s great-nieces, others were cousins or second cousins. The United States ambassador to Germany, John B. Emerson, also delivered remarks.        
“She couldn’t turn her back on Germany,” said Jilly Allenby-Ryan, the grandchild of Mr. Harnack’s sister. She was reading aloud from a letter her grandmother had written to remember Ms. Fish-Harnack after her death. “She wasn’t without fear, but she was brave,” Ms. Allenby-Ryan continued.        
A University of Wisconsin alumna who married a young German graduate student, Ms. Fish-Harnack moved to the eastern German city of Jena in 1929, only months before Black Tuesday and the dawn of the global financial crisis that would eventually propel Hitler and his Nazi party out of obscurity and into Parliament.        
In 1931, Ms. Fish-Harnack got a job lecturing on American literature at Berlin University at the same time that Albert Einstein was on the faculty there, according to the Web site of Wisconsin Public Television, which produced a documentary about Ms. Fish-Harnack. But the position was short lived. Fifteen months later the university had fired her for not being “Nazi enough.”        
Unsettled by the swell in far-right extremism in German society, Ms. Fish-Harnack and her husband joined the resistance group Rote Kapella, or Red Orchestra, with which they worked until being captured by the Nazis on Sept. 7, 1942, while on vacation at the Baltic Sea. Mr. Harnack was hanged three days before Christmas that year; Ms. Fish-Harnack was guillotined two months later. Her execution marked the only time an American civilian was murdered at Hitler’s direct behest, according to historians at the ceremony and information from the United States Embassy in Berlin.        
At one point during the afternoon, Neela Härting, 79, pulled out a wrinkled piece of paper to show to Ms. Allenby-Ryan, her cousin. It was a photocopy of a black-and-white picture of a 25-year-old Mr. Harnack dated Sept. 20, 1925.        
“They would not want to be remembered as heroes or victims,” Ms. Allenby-Ryan would later say. “But as people.”

CAVE CREEK, Ariz. — A baby buffalo stood guard outside Town Hall, snorting at the approach of three mounted police officers from nearby Scottsdale who had towed their horses here on a trailer.        


From the sideline, Larry Wendt, a former sheriff’s deputy whose saloon holds weekly live bull-riding spectacles, took the first shot. “They’re riding English!” he hollered — as in English saddles, which, being hornless, “are no saddle for real cowboys,” he explained.        
And so the tone and stage were set for a modern-day Western showdown that would be punctuated not by bullets, but by words on paper and a vote by seven elected Cave Creek officials, three of whom are actually East Coast transplants. At stake was Scottsdale’s motto, “The West’s Most Western Town,” which it has claimed on its official seal for more than 60 years. The people of Cave Creek were determined to prove that their town deserved the title instead.        
In a lighthearted way, the challenge distilled a familiar Western story, in which growth and development, having changed the land, threaten to transform tradition and a way of life.        
A resolution approved unanimously by the Cave Creek Town Council on Monday night listed three pages’ worth of justification for the town’s claim. Cave Creek, the Council asserted, is “both legally and properly called a town,” while Scottsdale is a city. It has “the only mayor that runs a horse-racing track, vice mayor that practices equine law, and a live-bull-riding town manager” — Rodney Glassman, who lasted under eight seconds, by his own estimation, in a competition at Mr. Wendt’s saloon, the Buffalo Chip.        
“Our mayor and Council are throwing down the gauntlet to claim a title that is rightfully theirs,” said Mr. Glassman, a former city councilman in Tucson who ran as a Democrat in 2010 against Arizona’s long-serving senator, John McCain.        
Close to 100 people packed the biggest room at Town Hall, most decked in Western gear, even if some did not seem entirely at ease in chaps and cowboy boots. One man, Bob Fox, strolled to the microphone carrying a live owl wearing a faux-diamond necklace — “big, flamboyant,” like Scottsdale, he said.        
Dennis E. Robbins, a Scottsdale councilman, wore perhaps the only straight face in the audience as he read a letter inked on a parchment scroll in defense of his city’s motto. “Our brand isn’t up for grabs,” he deadpanned. (He was accompanied by the city’s chief information officer, Kelly Corsette, who typed intently on a smartphone. “It wouldn’t be a Wild West showdown if someone wasn’t Tweeting about it,” he said.)        
It is hard to picture Scottsdale as it once was — a desert community of cattle ranches and fig, nut and citrus farms, many of which were subdivided long ago and sold for housing developments. The city is best known these days for its lavish spas, verdant golf courses, buzzing night life and bustling spring-training scene; the San Francisco Giants play in a ballpark downtown, within walking distance of many bars.        
New high-rise condos that sell for millions of dollars dot Scottsdale’s center. Its Old Town shopping district is a merely a replica (but so, it should be said, is Frontier Town in Cave Creek, where a yoga studio and a restaurant, the Horny Toad, share the main drag).        
By contrast, Mr. Wendt, the saloon’s owner, pointed out, most of Cave Creek, where hitching posts are a common sight, can still be reached on horseback, “like in the old days.”        
The town was settled in 1870 as a remount station for Army cavalry units working to protect settlers against Indians. It was the hub of a gold-mining district that spread across 144 miles, and home to one of the largest ranches in Arizona, the Cartwright Ranch, boasting 65,000 acres of grazing land.        
Today, working ranches are considerably more modest, but they still exist. Parts of town are zoned for properties no smaller than five acres to encourage horse ownership. At the local Laundromat, two machines are reserved for horse blankets.        
Still, for old-timers like Bev Metcalf Brooks, who has lived here for 53 years, changes have been enough to fundamentally alter the town’s character. Cave Creek, she said, “used to be” the West’s most Western town, when “real working cowboys” were around.        
No longer.        
“We’re a motorcycle town,” Ms. Brooks told Mayor Vincent Francia, Vice Mayor Adam Trenk and the town’s five city councilmen, among them Reg Monachino, who grew up in the Bronx.        
On weekends now, motorcycles cruise Cave Creek Road, which is lined by hills speckled by mesquite trees and saguaro cactuses. But to Evelyn Johnson, a Texas native who moved here from Seattle 17 years ago, it is not the ride or attire that certifies Cave Creek’s Western ethos.        
“Western isn’t about diamonds and denim, Levi’s and lace,” said Ms. Johnson, executive director of the Cave Creek Museum. “It’s a way of life.”        
In the letter Mr. Robbins read during Monday’s meeting, the mayor of Scottsdale, Jim Lane, suggested a meeting to “discuss real issues of mutual concern and benefit to our citizens.”        
Mayor Francia sent him a response on Thursday, saying he appreciated the invitation, but nonetheless hoped to settle the score the old-fashioned way. He challenged Mr. Lane to a quick-draw contest in the parking lot of the Horny Toad, to be held Nov. 2, at high noon.        



 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: September 24, 2013A picture caption on Saturday with an article about a showdown between Scottsdale and Cave Creek, Ariz., over the right to use the motto “the West’s most Western town” misstated, in some copies, part of the name of a buffalo being shown off in Cave Creek. The buffalo is Harley Wallbanger, not Harvey Wallbanger.

CARACAS, Venezuela — In the latest diplomatic dispute between the United States and Venezuela, American officials late Thursday gave permission for President Nicolás Maduro to fly over Puerto Rico on his way to a state visit in China and denied angry accusations from Venezuelan officials that the United States had tried to bar Mr. Maduro from its airspace.        


But Venezuela’s accusations resonated among some of its leftist allies in the region, who compared the contretemps to the incident in July when President Evo Morales of Bolivia was denied permission to fly over some European countries because, according to Bolivian officials, they wrongly suspected his plane was carrying Edward J. Snowden, the fugitive American intelligence leaker. Leftist leaders at the time accused the United States of being behind that incident, although Washington said it was not involved.        
On Thursday, Mr. Maduro and Foreign Minister Elías Jaua accused the United States of barring Mr. Maduro from American airspace, calling it an act of aggression.        
But on Friday, Roberta S. Jacobson, the United States assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, said that was not true and that the request had never been denied.        
American officials said that, instead, Venezuela had not followed normal procedures in submitting its request to enter American airspace and that Washington had granted it anyway.        
A State Department statement said that Venezuela had made the request on Wednesday, just a day before Mr. Maduro’s scheduled departure, when such requests are supposed to be made three days in advance.        
Officials also said that Mr. Maduro was flying in a Cubana Airlines jet and that diplomatic flight requests were supposed to involve official state aircraft.        
The statement said that, despite all of that, the United States had worked with Venezuelan officials to get the approval done quickly.        
“This whole thing is absurd,” Ms. Jacobson said.        
“This was a request that came in very late for an aircraft that is not a Venezuelan state aircraft and therefore would not normally get diplomatic clearance, and we got it done as quickly as we could so we don’t understand this reaction.”        
But Venezuela treated the flight request as a major international incident. Mr. Maduro said the United States had denied permission to use American airspace and said the United States had made a serious mistake. Mr. Jaua said it was an aggression against Venezuela.        
The dispute fits a pattern of recent incidents in which Venezuela, a major oil supplier to the United States, has grabbed onto seemingly innocuous comments or actions by American officials that it then seeks to turn into major confrontations.        
Mr. Maduro has increased verbal attacks against the United States since he was elected in April to replace the country’s longtime socialist president, Hugo Chávez, portraying Washington as an imperialist aggressor intent on undermining his government.        
In the end, however, the permission was granted and Mr. Maduro said in a Twitter post just before 10 p.m. that he was departing for China. It was not clear, however, what route the plane took or if it passed over Puerto Rico, which is a commonwealth of the United States.        
It was also unclear why Venezuelan officials chose that route. The first leg of Mr. Maduro’s flight took him from Caracas to Paris, an official said.        
Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst in Port Washington, N.Y., said that the most direct route from Caracas to Paris was over the Lesser Antilles and that flying over Puerto Rico, which is farther north, added about 100 miles to the flight path.        
He said that there could be valid reasons to travel the extra distance, including wind forecasts or technical issues associated with the type of aircraft being used.        
But he suggested another reason.        
“It could also have been a sharp stick in the eye,” he said. “And given some of the personalities involved that’s always possible.”        
The dust-up was used by other South American governments to lash out at the United States.        
Mr. Morales, speaking at a news conference in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, accused the United States of carrying out a policy of intimidation and said he planned to file a lawsuit in an international court charging President Obama with crimes against humanity.        
The foreign minister of Ecuador, Ricardo Patiño, also weighed in. “First it was with Bolivia and now with Venezuela,” he wrote in a Twitter post, implicating the United States. “What are they trying to do? Put at risk the friendship between people and peace in the world?”

Ariel Castro, who committed suicide in prison this month after pleading guilty to the imprisonment and rape of three women in Cleveland, used a sheet attached to a window hinge in his cell to hang himself, coroner’s investigative notes show. The hinge was almost seven feet from the floor. Two sheets of paper were found in the cell, one with Bible verses written on it and the other with the names of Mr. Castro’s children and grandchildren, the notes said. A Bible open to the book of John was also found.

After the authenticity of a guitar supposedly signed by Michael Jackson and Eddie Van Halen was called into question, the United States Marshals Service pulled the plug Friday on an online auction of items forfeited by former Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. The auction was intended to recoup part of the $750,000 in campaign funds that Mr. Jackson and his wife illegally spent on memorabilia, furs and other personal items. The agency announced Friday that it was canceling the auction “out of an abundance of caution.” Mr. Jackson was sentenced last month to a 2 ½-year prison term for scheming to spend campaign funds. His wife, Sandra, got a one-year sentence. Also Friday, Raghuveer Nayak, a onetime contributor to Mr. Jackson who was also a figure in scandals related to former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, pleaded guilty in a medical fraud case. Mr. Nayak admitted to charges that he bribed doctors to refer patients to surgery centers he owned. He faces a maximum 23-year sentence.

An Army veteran accused of fighting alongside a Qaeda-affiliated group of Syrian rebels is out of jail after a secret plea deal. The veteran, Eric Harroun, 31, of Phoenix, had been charged with providing material support to a terrorist group and faced up to life in prison. But under a deal entered in federal court in Alexandria, Mr. Harroun pleaded guilty to an obscure law regulating munition exports and was sentenced to time served. The plea deal remains sealed, though court records show it was entered on Thursday. Mr. Harroun had been jailed since March. Prosecutors accused him of fighting alongside the militant group Jabhet al-Nusra, one of many Syrian rebel groups seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad. But defense lawyers argued there was confusion about exactly which rebel group he had joined.

Sea ice in the Arctic Ocean underwent a sharp recovery this year from the record-low levels of 2012, with 50 percent more ice surviving the summer melt season, scientists said Friday. It is the largest one-year increase in Arctic ice since satellite tracking began in 1978.        


The experts added, however, that much of the ice remains thin and slushy, a far cry from the thick Arctic pack ice of the past. Because thin ice is subject to rapid future melting, the scientists said this year’s recovery was unlikely to portend any change in the relentless long-term decline of Arctic sea ice.        
“I’m not at all surprised there was a jump upward — we’ve never set two record lows in a row,” said Walt Meier, a NASA scientist who has monitored sea ice for years. “I would say I’m a little surprised the jump is as big as it is.”        
Last year’s ice extent was so low that this year’s recovery looks larger by comparison, Dr. Meier said. The main reason for this year’s growth, Dr. Meier added, was that the region was colder and cloudier through the spring and summer than in the recent past.        
“We had cool conditions, cooler than the long-term average, and yet it is still going to be the sixth-lowest ice minimum on record,” Dr. Meier said.        
Playing out over a generation, the decline of the Arctic ice cap has been one of the most striking effects of global warming, a change in the planetary aspect so large it would have been visible to an observer on the moon. “We could be looking at summers with essentially no sea ice on the Arctic Ocean only a few decades from now,” said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., in a statement.        
Contrary to popular impression, the melting of sea ice does not cause a rise of sea level, since the ice is already floating and displacing its weight in water. But the replacement of white ice with dark water does mean the surface of the Arctic Ocean can absorb far more heat in the summer, which could contribute to the melting of nearby land ice in Greenland, raising sea level.        
During the winter, the Arctic plunges into near-darkness 24 hours a day, and a skin of ice grows across most of the ocean surface. But during the summer, the sun shines continuously. The key to the status of the ice cap is how much of it survives the summer melt season to become thick, resilient ice.        
When satellite monitoring began in the late 1970s, about half the surface of the Arctic Ocean would be covered by ice at the end of the melt season, which usually occurs in September. By last year, that figure had fallen to 24 percent of the ocean surface, rising this year to 36 percent.        
The National Snow and Ice Data Center announced Friday that the low point in sea ice this year had occurred on Sept. 13. The timing varies from year to year, and the agency always waits several days before making an announcement to be certain the ice pack has begun to regrow.        
Lately, a new low in summer sea ice has been set every few years, followed by a few years of recovery, followed by yet another low that typically exceeds the previous one by a substantial margin.

BAD HOMBURG, Germany — Europe has barely been mentioned in the German election campaign. But in the final days before Sunday’s vote, a fringe party that wants to scrap the euro is gaining in the polls, threatening to scramble the country’s consensus politics with a message that has echoes of the Tea Party in America and rightist movements elsewhere in Europe.        


Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats are expected to emerge victorious from the elections. But polls are giving the upstart party, Alternative for Germany, a decent chance of winning seats in Parliament for the first time. Its surprising strength could have an outsize effect on the shape of the next German government and help determine how far it can go in satisfying the desire among its European Union partners for more forceful steps to end the Continent’s economic crisis.        
A small but committed minority of Germans see the party as the only alternative to mainstream parties too timid to admit that the euro has failed. And the party has offered a home to more socially conservative Germans who are unhappy with the way Ms. Merkel has pushed the conservative bloc to the center on social issues like gay rights.        
In recent days, there has been a sense of euphoria among Alternative for Germany’s supporters about its chances of winning a share of power. “I am convinced they will get into the Bundestag,” said Ingrid Cook, 63, who lives in Bad Pyrmont, in northwestern Germany, and translates technical manuals for a machinery company.        
Mrs. Cook said Friday that she had been handing out leaflets and working at party information stands in her area. “I have grandchildren, and I want to be able to tell them I saw the catastrophe coming and tried to do something about it,” she said by telephone.        
Alternative for Germany is poised to drain votes from Ms. Merkel’s party and its junior partner in government, the Free Democratic Party — enough, perhaps, to prevent the Free Democrats from reaching the 5 percent of the national vote needed to return to Parliament. Such a result would leave Ms. Merkel no alternative but an awkward coalition with her main opponents, the center-left Social Democrats.        
While Alternative for Germany would be too small to have much sway over policy, it could be a loud and disruptive voice in debates about measures to prevent the collapse of the euro, offering a rightist challenge to the determined centrism Ms. Merkel has pursued in her eight years as chancellor.        
As it has gained in strength, the party has been trying to move beyond a fixation with abolishing the common currency and attract social conservatives by talking about issues like family policy and tax reform.        
“In the past few weeks, the party has understood the need to expand beyond their image as a single-issue party and position themselves as an alternative for people who are socially conservative and no longer feel the Christian Democratic Union represents them,” said Oskar Niedermayer, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin.        
Alternative for Germany is decidedly a work in progress, attracting an eclectic group of supporters who seem to be united only by their conviction that the mainstream parties are not discussing the issues important to them.        
It remains to be seen whether the party can become a lasting force in German politics, in the same way that the Green Party emerged from the environmental movement in the 1980s, or whether, like so many other issue-driven parties in the past, it will self-destruct amid squabbles over doctrine and leadership posts.        
The party’s contradictions were on view at a forum it sponsored Thursday evening in Bad Homburg, a wealthy suburb of Frankfurt. One man in the audience stood up to urge the party to take a stand against same-sex marriage.        
Konrad Adam, one of the party’s leaders, conceded that it had no official stance on the issue. “We don’t have a position on every question,” Mr. Adam said, speaking from the stage of a community center.        
Another man rose to say Germans should get extra votes for each child they have, as a way of rewarding people who are helping to stave off population decline.        
Mr. Adam, a 71-year-old former political reporter, said he thought that was a good idea, while again cautioning that the party had no official position.        
In a country that has had public health care since the 19th century, the party’s rejection of government, however, is selective.

ATLANTA — Nine days after the University of Alabama’s campus newspaper detailed chronic racial discrimination within the campus’s Greek system, the university’s president said on Friday that six minority students had accepted offers of admission to traditionally white sororities.        


The announcement marked the first time since 2003 that those organizations said they had added minority students to their memberships. Other new minority members could follow, said the president, Judy L. Bonner.        
“I am confident that we will achieve our objective of a Greek system that is inclusive, accessible and welcoming to students of all races and ethnicities,” Dr. Bonner said in a videotaped statement. “We will not tolerate anything less.”        
Dr. Bonner said the sororities had extended 72 bids this week to students, including 11 black women.        
By Friday afternoon, six women who are minorities had agreed to join the sororities, including Halle Lindsay, who accepted an offer of admission from the Alpha Gamma Delta chapter in Tuscaloosa.        
“This is all so surreal and exciting,” Ms. Lindsay wrote on her Twitter account. “I love my sisters already and happy to be an Alpha Gam!”        
The national headquarters of Alpha Gamma Delta did not respond to a request for comment.        
News of the admissions capped a tumultuous week for the university, the site of a Wednesday demonstration by hundreds of students and faculty members who demanded an end to long-running racial biases on the campus.        
In marching to the Rose Administration Building, the protesters recalled the actions of Gov. George Wallace, who 50 years ago tried to bar African-American students from enrolling at the university, where blacks now make up more than 12 percent of the student body.        
Although segregation in Alabama’s Greek system had been the subject of periodic anger and conversations through the years, the issue resurfaced last week when The Crimson White published an interview with a woman who described the conduct inside the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority house during August’s recruitment process.        
According to the woman, Melanie Gotz, the sorority’s alumnae forbade current students from offering bids to two black women, one of them the stepgranddaughter of a member of Alabama’s board of trustees.        
After days of escalating pressure, Dr. Bonner, in an abrupt reversal of the university’s longstanding contention that the privately run Greek organizations should fashion their own membership standards, ordered the sororities to engage in a protracted recruitment process.        
On Friday, she said that step was “already yielding positive results,” and she expected the sororities to continue to broaden their membership throughout the academic year.

MILAN — Not too long from now, Karl Lagerfeld will pass a milestone in fashion. He will have spent 50 years at Fendi, designing its fun furs and cerebral ready-to-wear.        


Mr. Lagerfeld hasn’t exactly spent a half-century looking out a single window. He works for Chanel, too. And lately he has been slapping his name on products at a do-or-die rate.        
At least one part of his brain remains, by design, slow and analog in its thinking, with broad excursions to the past. And it’s this part, I suspect, that keeps him rooted in one place for so long. But the other part is highly alert and reactive, constantly moving toward new ideas and devouring them. With good reason, he has been compared to a shark.        
Whatever accounts for this vital mix of the comfortable and the hard-wired, Mr. Lagerfeld keeps re-energizing himself. With Fendi, more than Chanel, he likes the idea of digital technology; this season, he uses words like “informatics” and “hyperlinked” to describe the modular design of the clothes, as well as the grid patterns.        
It’s very possible that he doesn’t have a clue what these terms mean. But the language and imagery of the Web give him an idea, and that’s what he reacts to. In truth, if you want a better thought picture for the opening dresses in the Fendi show, dresses in overlapping panels of laser-cut, fluorescent pastel organza, it would be James Turrell’s light sculpture in the Guggenheim rotunda, with its graduated and minimally composed hues.        
Mr. Lagerfeld is obviously limited by the surface and function of a dress. He also is keen to apply Fendi’s skills, especially with fur, to his visual statement about light, pattern and color. And “light” must mean weightlessness, as well.        
He achieved this harmony throughout the show, but you see it most vividly in the opening organza dresses and those in which the grid patterns were done with shaved fur mounted on organza. Typically they were done in three slightly different patterns, in three solid colors, with the organza allowing light to pass through.        
In his review of the Turrell show, Peter Schjeldahl of The New Yorker noted that this kind of installation “trumps a trend among contemporary artists, favored by art institutions, toward clamorous, hysterically clever spectacle and performance.” Well, fashion is insanely clever at the moment — too many novel fabrics and crashing colors on what amount to conventional shapes. And since designers have to knock out new collections every few months, the subtle doesn’t get traction. Plus, you need someone who can work as hard, and think as fast, as Mr. Lagerfeld.        
The Prada show was definitely a big spectacle. That’s what editors and buyers have come to expect from Miuccia Prada. I loved her spring men’s show, in June, if only because her creepy paradise theme made me wonder if she was slyly referencing the novels of Michel Houellebecq.        
Her woman’s show the other night felt a bit stingy, in spite of the saturated colors and the bobblehead blowups of illustrations on dresses, which mirrored those on the walls of the Prada show space. For the presentation, the company invited four muralists and two illustrators to create work around the themes of femininity, power and multiplicity. According to Prada, the concept originated from an interest in political wall art from Mexico.        
In one sense, the exuberant energy of the artwork — it was done with the artists working together in the space — was repeated in the clothes. But in another sense, it felt as if the energy and spirit of feminine power was simply being mimicked in the overloaded designs, with shapes and fabrics from Prada’s archive.        
The most compelling designs were sleeveless shifts in viscose knit that evoked athletic wear (the models wore soccer socks with sports sandals). They projected an air of physical strength that most women can relate to. But if Ms. Prada was broadly making a case for feminine power, it was hard to see why she included cheerleader skirts and dresses with bra designs. My assumption is she knows young women will think they’re cute.        
At Gucci, Frida Giannini combined active-wear styles, like track pants and flowing beach tunics, with Art Nouveau patterns inspired by Erté. It was an interesting idea, and it helped to soften up the brand. But I kept wondering where one was meant to wear these clothes; with their black mesh bras and streaming ties, they looked too exposed for the city. A yacht? A modern apartment tower in Shanghai? You needed some imagination, which, I guess, is not a bad thing.        
Today, in Italy, MaxMara’s neominimalist pencil skirts in pearl-beige linen with matching cashmere sweaters, or etched-looking denim separates in plain, tonal designs (the press notes alluded to a Robert Ryman monochrome painting), looked almost modest. They are not out of step with the times. On the contrary, they seem a buffer.        
With so many dressy clothes on the runways, one starts to long for a simple summer dress. Italian sportswear seems almost extinct. Tod’s has hired Alessandra Facchinetti, who started her career at Prada, to create sportswear and accessories. She made a small start on Friday, but it was excellent. There were lovely shirtdresses in rust and pale pink cotton with a gather across the back, a relaxed pantsuit in powder blue cotton, distinctive leathers and a jaunty version of the Tod’s moccasin.        
Donatella Versace’s collection was populist luxury to the hilt, a mere skip in her skyscraper platforms and printed flare skirts and bustiers (or mesh silk shorts with a ruched crinkle up the rear) to the country’s TV personalities. This, too, is not a bad thing. Because with all her brawny instincts, Ms. Versace is just reacting to her world.

BAGHDAD — ON a recent afternoon, a pistol lay on Munir Haddad’s coffee table. A television, sound off, played professional wrestling. As a visitor entered he told an assistant to remove the gun, embarrassed by its presence, but then said he is never without a weapon, even in the bathroom.        


He proudly pointed to a picture on the wall of himself standing next to Anthony M. Kennedy, the United States Supreme Court justice, and singled out other photographs that line the walls of his office. There he is, with emirs, ayatollahs, princes and ambassadors. One stands out more than the others. In it, a smiling Mr. Haddad, in a judge’s robe, is peering up from a desk at a man whose face is unseen but whose identity is unmistakable: Saddam Hussein.        
Mr. Haddad refers to himself as “the guy who hung Saddam Hussein,” and while it was an ensemble cast who carried out the dictator’s execution, he played a leading role. He presided over the trial, and, early one morning in 2006, in a drab room in a former military intelligence building, Mr. Haddad read Mr. Hussein the execution order and then accompanied him to the gallows.        
Since then, life for Mr. Haddad, who as a Shiite and a Kurd was doubly oppressed under a dictatorship that was dominated by a Sunni Arab elite, has taken on an unlikely trajectory. He is now in a private law practice, having been pushed out of the judiciary, like so many qualified civil servants, by the Shiite-dominated government and replaced, he says, by political party hacks. He has carved out a late-career niche — and a new measure of fame — defending countless Sunnis jailed on what he and human rights activists say are spurious terrorism charges.        
“I used to be a hero for the Kurds and the Shiites,” he said, because of his role in Mr. Hussein’s trial. “Now, I’m a hero for the Sunnis.”        
He has also gotten rich.        
“I have become a millionaire,” he said, immodestly, and then ticked off the locales in which, he said, he owns homes: Beirut, Dubai, Barcelona, Germany.        
“Last week I bought a big house in Holland,” he said. He said he had plenty of money, but kept working because “my wife and daughter want everything.”        
His family lives in the northern Kurdish region, where life is easier and safer than elsewhere in Iraq, and where, he said, his daughter recently called him asking for a $40,000 Jeep. He said he would purchase it in Baghdad and have it sent north.        
As he spoke, he remembered that he was due in Beirut in a few days, to try to sell a property there because he is worried that the war in Syria will drive down real estate prices. He called in an assistant and pulled from his pocket a roll of $100 bills, peeling off a few and telling the young man to buy a plane ticket to Beirut.        
MR. HADDAD’S story tells two truths of modern Iraq: the exile of educated technocrats from government service in favor of the patronage appointments of party-aligned officials who bend to the will of a powerful prime minister, and the vast wealth that is available to the well-connected in a society where the majority of citizens live in abject poverty.        
With violence in Iraq increasing, the government has responded with some of its harshest crackdowns yet on Sunni areas, casting a wide net in pursuit of terrorism suspects, arresting the innocent and guilty alike. Which is good news, of course, for Mr. Haddad, whose business is booming. He said his phone was constantly ringing, with calls coming in from Anbar, Mosul and Tikrit, Sunni areas where young men are filling the jails.        
Through Mr. Haddad’s efforts, Abu Hussein, a Sunni police officer in Samarra, was recently released from jail after being held for a year on terrorism charges that he said were false and made by an anonymous informer. That is standard practice here. Many Iraqis, some of whom used to feed tips to the American military in exchange for money, now earn a living informing on their neighbors. The problem, say human rights activists and Iraqi officials, is that the information is often false.        
After his arrest, a friend told Abu Hussein about Mr. Haddad.        
“They said he is the one who defends the innocent people,” he recalled. “The Iraqi law is protecting those informers, but never the innocent people.”        
He continued: “He is a Shiite man, but he defends the Sunnis. He knows what is right and wrong, and sect is not important.”

JERUSALEM — THIS month marks 20 years since the signing of the first of the Oslo Accords between the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Two decades after Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat stood on the White House lawn with President Bill Clinton, Israelis and Palestinians are again in the midst of the umpteenth round of negotiations.        


Despite these efforts, true peace seems as distant as it did before the secret talks in Oslo were revealed to the world. The government of Israel must admit that we made a mistake and declare that the Oslo process has failed.        
Only by officially annulling the Oslo Accords will we have the opportunity to rethink the existing paradigm and hopefully lay the foundations for a more realistic modus vivendi between the Jews and Arabs of this region.        
Despite attempts to rewrite recent history by fringe elements, the failure of the Oslo framework cannot be attributed to a lack of will and persistence by Israel. What didn’t we try? We attempted direct negotiations, third-party mediators, public conferences and back-channel talks. We staged withdrawals and unilateral disengagements, established joint Israeli-Palestinian military patrols in Gaza and deployed American-trained security forces in the West Bank. None of this worked.        
The P.L.O., and later the Palestinian Authority, never truly accepted that Israel, as the national state and homeland of the Jewish people, was here to stay. No amount of impressive ceremonies, cosmetic changes to the P.L.O. charter and Palestinian doublespeak to Western media outlets about their commitment to peace was able to change this grim fact.        
To understand the mind-boggling scope of Oslo’s failure, it is best to look at the statistics. According to the organization B’Tselem, during the first Palestinian intifada in 1987, six years before Mr. Rabin’s attempt to recast the archterrorist Yasir Arafat as a peacemaker, 160 Israelis were murdered in Palestinian terror attacks. In the mid- to late-1990s, as successive Israeli governments negotiated with the Palestinians, and Mr. Arafat and his cronies repeatedly swore they were doing their utmost to end terrorism, 240 Israelis were brutally killed as suicide bombs and other heinous terrorist acts targeting unarmed civilians were unleashed in every corner of our nation.        
Things did not get better after Prime Minister Ehud Barak made the Palestinians an offer in 2000 that, judging by his landslide defeat in the election a few months later, was way beyond what most Israelis supported. Between then and September 2010, 1,083 Israelis were murdered by Palestinian terrorists.        
The Oslo process did not bring peace; it brought increased bloodshed. We must end this farce by announcing the immediate suspension of the accords.        
Little impact would be felt by average Israelis and Palestinians. Those who would suffer most would be full-time negotiators like Martin S. Indyk and Saeb Erekat, who would find themselves out of a job after 20 years of gainful employment in the peace process industry.        
What should replace Oslo’s false promise? We should implement what I have called a “three-state solution.” In the future, the final status of the Palestinians will be determined in a regional agreement involving Jordan and Egypt, when the latter has been restabilized. All the region’s states must participate in the process of creating a long-term solution for the Palestinian problem.        
In the short term, the Palestinians will continue to have autonomy over their civilian lives while Israel remains in charge of security throughout Judea and Samaria, commonly referred to as the West Bank. Following an initial period, the Arab residents of Judea and Samaria could continue to develop their society as part of an agreement involving Israel and Jordan. Similarly, Gaza residents could work with Israel and Egypt to create a society that granted them full civil authority over their lives in a manner that was acceptable to all sides.        
Most veterans of the peace process will mock this proposal, protesting that there is no way it would be accepted by the Palestinians. Their argument may seem convincing today, but as I often remind my critics, our region is unpredictable. Had you told any Middle East expert five years ago that two successive Egyptian presidents would be deposed and Bashar al-Assad’s regime would be in the midst of a bloody civil war, you, too, would have been mocked. Things change. We can make them change.        
I am aware that even if the Palestinians accepted this plan, we would still have to deal with a fundamentalist Hamas regime in Gaza and continuing instability in Egypt. No plan for Israeli-Arab peace can be fully implemented until these issues are resolved.        
In the short term, Israel’s only option is to manage this conflict by refusing to compromise when it comes to the security of Israeli citizens. At the same time, our government should take all steps possible to improve the economic well-being of the Palestinians.        
The dissolution of the Oslo Accords would serve as the official act validating what we already know — that this failed framework is totally irrelevant in 2013. Once the Palestinians were ready to sit down and seriously discuss how our two peoples, through this new paradigm, could live side by side in peace and prosperity, they would find willing partners across the political spectrum in Israel.        
It may not be the utopian peace promised to all of us on that sunny day in September 1993, but in the harsh realities of the Middle East, this may be the best we can hope for and the sole realistic chance for our children to grow up in a world less violent than previous generations have had to endure.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — To measure the popularity and financial heft of the N.F.L., one need only look at the record amounts paid for franchises, the league’s ever-rising television ratings and the astronomical prices for Super Bowl tickets.         
But one of the purest links can be found in the vast distribution centers owned by Fanatics, the nation’s largest online seller of licensed sports merchandise.        
On the Monday after the league’s opening weekend, workers here scrambled to unload trailers filled with everything from caps and jerseys to shot glasses and doormats. Half a football field away, pickers trolled the aisles with scanners and carts to collect the goods ordered overnight by fans across the country.        
Merchandise carrying the brands of the Denver Broncos, the Dallas Cowboys, the Miami Dolphins and the New Orleans Saints — all teams that won their openers — were among the most popular items being dropped into plastic boxes and sent by conveyor belt to sorters, who matched the orders. Packers then put the merchandise in bags or boxes and sent them to be loaded onto trailers destined for the airport.        
“The day after N.F.L. kickoff is a Fanatics moment,” said Dennis Matthews, who runs the 520,000-square-foot building and brought in 75 extra workers that Monday, the start of a busy season that runs through Christmas.        
The moment is also one of the clearest distillations of the willingness of fans to spend money to celebrate their teams. It’s the bedrock of the business of Fanatics, which not only operates the online shop of the N.F.L. but also those of Major League Baseball, the N.B.A., the N.H.L., Nascar, the PGA Tour and more than 150 college and pro teams. Fanatics’s success is based on fast access to more than one million items for professional and college teams, conferences and leagues. The importance of N.F.L. sales to that business is a sign of the pre-eminence of the country’s largest league in the licensed sports goods market, which generates about $15 billion in sales a year.        
Most licensed sports gear is still sold through traditional brick-and-mortar outlets. But those stores also typically sell bats, balls, running shoes, ice hockey skates and other gear, leaving them limited space for the jerseys, shirts and hats of even local teams. Often they stock only those of the most popular players.        
Fanatics, by contrast, sells goods for every player and team, in every size and design. That means a fan of, say, the Seattle Seahawks who lives in Miami can get a Marshawn Lynch jersey delivered to the front door as easily as a Georgia Bulldogs fan in Texas can get a beer mug. Fans can also find goods for instant sensations like Jeremy Lin, Colin Kaepernick and Yasiel Puig.        
“Emotions come and go quickly in sports, so we need to give fans what they want,” said Michael Rubin, the principal owner and executive chairman of Fanatics.        
These so-called displaced fans made the bulk of the 15 million orders that Fanatics shipped last year. The company, however, is eager to expand beyond them to meet an ambitious goal of generating at least $5 billion in annual revenue over the next decade, from $1 billion this year.        
The goal is audacious given that the revenue from licensed sports merchandise grew by only 2.2 percent last year and is still 17 percent below its peak in 2006, according to the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers’ Association.        
“When the recession hit, there was less disposable income and consumers were worried about gotta-haves instead of want-to-haves,” said Marty Brochstein, the senior vice president for industry relations and information at the association. “The licensed products market doesn’t go against consumer trends.”        
Still, Brochstein said that more than other retail items, licensed sports merchandise is well suited to online shopping because many fans follow teams in cities far from where they live. Younger consumers are also more comfortable spending money on the Internet, so over time the share of online sales should grow, a boon to Fanatics, he said.

I know you’re worried about the government shutting down on Oct. 1. Who wouldn’t be? Services suspended, the nation’s credibility damaged in the eyes of the rest of the world. What serious person would want to let that happen?        


Hehehehe.        
The better to plan your watchful worry, here’s a tentative schedule of events:        
Monday, Sept. 23: Senate goes into session to consider the House bill that couples funding for the government with defunding Obamacare.        
House is on vacation. I’m serious.        
Wednesday, Sept. 25: House comes back from vacation. Early. So stop carping.        
Thursday, Sept. 26: Senate is working its way toward a vote on the bill. Whoops! Somebody just objected to something. May take a little while longer.        
Friday, Sept. 27: The House takes up a bill to raise the debt ceiling, thus allowing the government to continue paying its bills. Which is tied to defunding Obamacare, and construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.        
Saturday, Sept. 28: The entire planet says: “Keystone pipeline?” 
Sunday, Sept. 29: Maybe a day or two before, but around here — the Senate strips the Obamacare part from the bill funding the government, passes the bill and sends it back to the House.        
Sept. 30: Last minute! Clock is ticking!        
Oct. 1: Best-case scenario — the House passes the bill in the wee small hours of the morning. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief and moves on to the question of whether the government’s ability to pay its debts should hinge on the construction of an oil pipe to the Gulf Coast.        
One thing at a time. About keeping the government running: In the end, it’ll all be up to the House Republicans — pass a clean bill or dig in their heels and turn off the lights. “At that point, House Republicans must stand firm, hold their ground, and continue to listen to the American people,” said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.        
House leaders were less than thrilled with his advice. It was sort of like a guy who left the Alamo at the last minute, yelling “Victory or Death!” as he galloped out of sight. Some people believe that Cruz is behind everything crazy going on in Washington right now. This is possibly true, if you work under the reasonable assumption that everything that happens in the world is based on a movie plot.        
THE CALGARIAN CANDIDATE        
During the Bush administration, agents of the Democratic Party hatch a long-term plot to ensure political ascendancy in the 21st century. Their secret tool: a Canadian-born Texas lawyer who they kidnap and brainwash. The mole — we will call him T. — suddenly emerges out of political obscurity in 2012, propelled into the U.S. Senate by members of the Texas Republican Party who have also been secretly hypnotized by the Democratic operatives. The only sign of their transformation is a compulsion to say “T. is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life” over and over again.  
By the next year, Democrats decide they want to force the Congressional Republicans to behave with breathtaking irresponsibility. Time to pull the trigger! While T. is standing alone at a Washington costume party, he is approached by a beautiful woman dressed as the Second Amendment. And then ... 
Actually, the House Republicans have plenty of Tea Party patriots who are perfectly capable of being crazy all by themselves. Representative Ted Yoho of Florida told The Times’s Ashley Parker and Jonathan Weisman that he was ready to stick to his guns: “It only takes one with passion — look at Rosa Parks, Lech Walesa, Martin Luther King.”        
I am mentioning this partly because it isn’t often you hear someone equate eliminating health insurance for the poor with Rosa Parks. Also because I like to write “Representative Ted Yoho.”        
The bill the House sent to the Senate on Friday doesn’t even make much sense. The “defund Obamacare” part looks as though it was written by squirrels. If it became law, Obamacare would actually continue to exist. At most, the administration would be crippled in their early efforts to get younger uninsured Americans to sign up for health coverage. (This would presumably give the opposition more time to run those ads that show a young woman being given a pelvic exam by a monster Uncle Sam doll.) And, meanwhile, the popular Children’s Health Insurance Program would be thrown into chaos, as well as payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients.        
But what the heck. No sacrifice is too great when the cause is convincing young adults that they shouldn’t buy health coverage.        
It’s an intense moment, even by current political standards. When the Republicans met in conference on Friday, Politico reported, Representative Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania compared John Boehner to Jesus: “I don’t want this to be like Palm Sunday, where we bring the speaker in on a little donkey and then next Friday, we crucify him.”        
I know, I’m having a hard time getting the image out of my mind, too.

Two bombs hidden inside air-conditioners exploded Friday in a Sunni mosque packed with worshipers north of Baghdad, killing at least 18 people. The attack took place on the outskirts of the city of Samarra. The deputy head of the municipal council, Mizhar Fleih, said bombs had been placed inside two of the air-conditioning units of the Musaab bin Omair mosque. The blasts also wounded 21 people, he said.

ATLANTA — Steve Stricker cut his PGA Tour playing schedule nearly in half this year so he could be a more attentive husband and father, and he found that a balanced life was worth pursuing.        


In 12 tour starts, Stricker, 46, played well enough to qualify for the season-ending 30-man Tour Championship. The average number of starts in 2013 by the other players in the field who do not divide their time between North America and Europe is 24.        
Stricker’s family values and fan outreach make him a PGA Tour commissioner’s dream, but his stellar performance on a pared-down schedule are not necessarily ideal for the Tour chief Tim Finchem.        
If Stricker, who is tied for seventh place after 36 holes at East Lake Golf Club, ends up winning the Tour Championship and collecting the $10 million bonus after playing in roughly one out of every three tournaments, winning none and skipping one of the first three playoff events, what is to keep other stars from turning their careers into season-long cameos?        
“If 40 players would do it, I wouldn’t like that,” Finchem said. “But that’s not going to happen.”        
He probably has no cause to fret. Stricker said: “I’ve talked to a few players this year that have asked me a thing or two about my schedule and what I’ve been doing and how come I come out and still play at a fairly high level at times. You know, there’s some guys, I think, that think about it. And doing it for me was the hard part. I thought about it for a lot of years. But actually doing it is another step.”        
Brandt Snedeker, the defending FedEx Cup champion, looks at Stricker as an anomaly and not a trendsetter.        
“There’s maybe three or four guys that can do that out here,” he said, making clear he is not one of them.        
“Steve can put the clubs away for three weeks, come out and play great,” Snedeker said. “I’m a guy that kind of plays into form. I need to be out here and play in competition and work myself into form that way. I can’t seem to get the same kind of focus at home practicing.”        
Stricker’s one-piece swing works to his advantage because it is easy to repeat even after a long layoff. It is like riding a bicycle, whereas a swing with many moving parts is more like riding a unicycle. “He has no hands in his golf swing,” Snedeker said, “no hands in his putting.”        
To thrive while playing a part-time schedule, it helps to have grown up in a climate where the seasons provided built-in breaks. The Wisconsin-born Stricker said, “We didn’t play all year-round, so it’s like I feel like I need to get away from it at times.”        
The primary factor in Stricker’s decision is that he has two school-age children, both daughters, who were growing up while he was gone. Five other players in the field have school-age children, including the divorced dad Tiger Woods, who worked his 16 tour starts this year around visits with his daughter and son.        
Matt Kuchar has two boys who are still young enough to travel with him on the tour. As they grow older, he said, he could envision following Stricker’s lead. “If it came down to it and I needed to spend more time with family, yeah, I could absolutely,” Kuchar said. “I think that’s the scenario that I can envision adopting that sort of schedule.”        
Since the start of the 2010 season, Stricker has missed one cut, the 2012 Players Championship. His history of consistency is cited as another reason he is one of the few players who could thrive while playing less. Stricker is one of six players in this week’s field who did not miss a cut on tour this year. The others are Kuchar, Woods, Sergio García, Jason Day and Adam Scott.        
Stricker cannot separate the consistency in his professional life from the constancy in his personal life. He said: “I’ve got a good balance in my life. I’m happy with what I’m doing. I’m comfortable with the decisions I’ve made along the way, and that goes a lot. When you’re off the course, life is in good shape, makes things a little bit easier to do out here on the road. I’ve been a little bit easier on myself. I come out fresher. I come out with a better attitude. I’m excited to be at each and every tournament. I think that’s been good.”        
Ultimately, deciding on a schedule is like deciding on a club. If not fully committed to the choice, the results are often regrettable. “You have to believe a limited schedule is what’s right for you,” said Jim Furyk by way of explaining why, at age 43, with two school-age children, a repeatable swing, a cold-weather background, consistent results and financial security, he cannot see himself playing a dozen events a year any time soon.        
“I think Strick was at the point he knew what was right for him, so he found a way to be very competitive at 12 events,” Furyk said, “where if you said in your mind, ‘I really should be playing 20 but I’m going to play 12,’ it doesn’t work.”        
Furyk, who has 22 tour starts this year, added: “I think the guys are interested in what he’s doing. They’re kind of jealous because he’s played so well doing so. What I admire is not the fact that he’s played 12 events but that he kind of figured out what is best for his family and went ahead and did it.”

MEXICO CITY — The twin storms that tore through the country this week, unleashing rains that sent mud crashing down hillsides, buckling roads and flooding coastal cities, have renewed criticism that corruption and political shortsightedness made the damage even worse.        


The death toll rose to 101 late Friday, but was expected to climb higher as rescue workers reached by air isolated mountain villages that had been cut off by landslides along the Pacific Coast. Soldiers continued their search Friday for 68 missing people in La Pintada, a coffee-growing village in Guerrero State where a hillside had given way and a river of mud poured over the town’s center.        
“Anywhere you fly over you will see a number of landslides that are truly shocking,” Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said Friday.        
The storms battered both the Pacific and Gulf Coasts starting last weekend, a rare double hit from tropical systems at the same time. But experts said officials had not learned from earlier hurricanes and had failed to prepare for disaster, which magnified the losses this time.        
“If we had the right development plan, the country wouldn’t fall into chaos,” said Angel Macías Garza, the vice president for infrastructure at the Mexican Construction Industry Chamber.        
Corrupt officials give permits to developers to build along riverbeds and in canyons, Mr. Macías said. State governors build roads without containing walls in flood-prone regions because they prefer to spend the money they save on handouts. The federal disaster fund allocates only 5 percent of its budget on prevention and the other 95 percent on reconstruction.        
“Politically, prevention doesn’t pay,” Mr. Macías said. “There is a lack of vision and a lack of resources.”        
In an editorial posted on its Web site, Cidac, a research group, echoed the criticism. “Taking preventive measures, like relocating settlements from the most vulnerable areas or investing in infrastructure,” the authors said, “doesn’t appear to sell ad space or generate grateful constituencies.”        
The worst natural disaster to affect Mexico in years began last weekend when Manuel, a tropical storm, battered Acapulco and the surrounding Pacific Coast at the same time as Hurricane Ingrid, a Category 1 storm, bore down on the Gulf Coast. Mexico had not seen paired storms on both coasts since 1958, officials said. Manuel then spun out to sea and gathered force before buffeting Sinaloa State in the north again on Thursday.        
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a brief visit to Mexico City on Friday that had been scheduled to encourage closer economic ties between the countries, announced that the United States government had donated $250,000 to the Red Cross for emergency relief and offered more direct American assistance. “It’s your decision,” he said, careful not to make the offer seem a criticism of the handling of the storm by Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto.        
Mr. Peña Nieto, whose performance in the crisis is being closely scored, spent most of the week flying between coasts to monitor rescue efforts, and canceled a visit to New York next week to address the United Nations General Assembly.        
He has been pushing Mexico’s Congress to approve an ambitious agenda of laws that would raise taxes, open up the energy sector and confront powerful monopolies.        
Mexico’s economy has stagnated, and growth may not reach the government’s tepid forecast of 1.8 percent. Mr. Peña Nieto’s plans for new investments in infrastructure to help jump-start the economy could be derailed by cleanup costs after the storms. Mexico’s construction trade association estimated that fixing the roads alone could cost more than $3 billion.        
Still, the president said on Wednesday, these storms “will not paralyze the development that Mexico should have.”        
The government reopened the main highway between Acapulco and Mexico City on Friday under blue skies, while officials farther north were just beginning to tally the damage from Manuel.        
Tiny La Pintada mourned its missing Friday as soldiers continued to search the river of mud for victims. A police helicopter vanished in the region late Thursday, a sign of how perilous the mountain rescue effort was.        
Many of La Pintada’s residents had been inside making lunch, which may have saved them, when the hillside collapsed Monday, Mr. Osorio Chong said. But the number of victims may rise, he added, as residents of nearby farms often waited in the town center to use the telephone there.

CULVER CITY, Calif. — The weekend broadcasts of “All Things Considered” are heading West.         
At an underutilized NPR office here, the famed afternoon program will reboot itself on Saturday with a new host, Arun Rath, a new time zone and even a rearrangement of its brassy theme music.        
NPR officials have billed it as a rare chance for a legacy radio program, previously based in Washington with the rest of the public radio organization, to rethink what it is and does — and let listeners decide if the changes sound good.        
The timing is somewhat awkward, since NPR is trying to balance its budget by cutting about 10 percent of its work force, initially through voluntary buyouts and, if necessary, through layoffs. The plan, announced last week, has been demoralizing for some employees — but the shows must go on, including “Weekend All Things Considered,” for which Mr. Rath was hired away from the PBS program “Frontline” in July.        
For NPR, “All Things Considered” is one of its two flagships, the other being “Morning Edition.” NPR says about 12 million people hear at least a part of the weekday program on a typical week; 2 million hear the shorter weekend program.        
Guy Raz was the host of the one-hour weekend edition until the end of last year, when he moved over to the “TED Radio Hour.” While Jacki Lyden and others filled in, NPR executives talked at length about how to adjust the show over the long term.        
“Geographic diversity was very important to us,” said Ellen McDonnell, NPR’s executive editor of news programming. “Hurricane Sandy focused our attention on how we would broadcast if there was a situation where we were incapacitated at our Washington facility. Brainstorming began and after a few meetings we agreed that moving the show west was central to our editorial and future business continuity.”        
These weren’t entirely new thoughts for NPR. The organization opened the cavernous facility it calls NPR West in 2002 and for a while originated two programs from here, including “Day to Day,” a well-regarded newsmagazine. But the programs were canceled amid a round of budget cutbacks in 2008 and 2009. NPR West has remained home to the organization’s Southern California bureau and to a number of “Morning Edition” staff members, including that program’s co-host, Renee Montagne, but the move of “Weekend All Things Considered” has brought more energy.        
“It’s good to be out West,” said Mr. Rath, who has yet to unpack all the boxes in his new office.        
“We’ll have more stories from the West; more voices from the West,” he said. “But the core values of the program aren’t going to change.”        
Kevin Roderick, the founder and editor of L.A. Observed, which covers the city’s media and politics, said: “I’m always a little wary when a national news outlet says it’s going to flavor its usual fare with more L.A. or West Coast ‘perspective.’        
“The results tend to be disappointing or at least underwhelming. But it’s good for NPR to strive for more outside-Washington sensibility, and the people involved understand the turf, so in that sense I think it’s a plus for the weekend show to be based here.”

Delay and defund. And default.        


That is the House Republicans’ brilliant plan in their last-ditch effort to block implementation of the Affordable Care Act. It is a plan that threatens to grind the government to a halt and wreak havoc on the economy.        
If they can’t take over Washington, they’ll shut it down. It’s their way or no way. All or nothing.        
This is what has become of a party hijacked by zealots.        
It would be tempting to blame all Republicans for this absurdity, but that would be unfair. There are still Republicans who are interested in good governance, but they’re being dragged to the nether regions of nonsensical policy making by younger, more ideological members of Congress, many from safely gerrymandered districts that form virtual echo chambers of irrationality.        
The old guard has warned against the recklessness of the tactics of far-right House Republicans.        
John McCain told CNN on Thursday: “In the United States Senate, we will not repeal, or defund, Obamacare. We will not. And to think we can is not rational.”        
Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said of the House Republicans’ strategy of threatening a government shutdown to force the defunding of Obamacare, “I think it’s the dumbest idea I’ve ever heard of.”        
Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, has said: ""There isn’t anybody that thinks that Obamacare is going to get defunded. It cannot happen.” He added, “It is as impossible as anything can possibly be in Washington, D.C.”        
Even Karl Rove struck a rational tone in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published online Wednesday evening, saying:        
“Any strategy to repeal, delay or replace the law must have a credible chance of succeeding or affecting broad public opinion positively. The defunding strategy doesn’t. Going down that road would strengthen the president while alienating independents. It is an ill-conceived tactic, and Republicans should reject it.”        
But all those pleas seem to have fallen on deaf ears, or at least defiant ones.        
On Friday, House Republicans (and two Democrats) passed a spending resolution that would cut all funding for the health care law.        
This bill has no chance of passing in the Senate, but that wasn’t the point. The point was to gum up the works and to force vulnerable Democrats in heavily red states to go on record as refusing to defund the health care law.        
These Republicans aren’t afraid the law will fail as much as they’re afraid that it will succeed and become part of the fabric of the collective conscience — and worst yet, be a clear legacy victory for President Obama.        
There is no more bitter Tea Party loss than a perceived Obama victory. The president is the focal point of the party’s frustrations. Tea Party representatives have been sent to Washington with a singular mission: obstruct Obama.        
These Kamikaze members of Congress have made the House of Representative a house of horrors, where smart thinking is smothered, where rabble demand respect.        
These are members of Congress from districts where the distrust of the federal government and the distaste for this president are blinding.        
Some of them twist poll results to buttress their bitterness. They point to polls showing that most Americans opposed the law as fuel for their fight. What they neglect to reveal is that a sizable portion of those who opposed the law do so because they don’t think it goes far enough, not because it goes too far. A May CNN/ORC poll found that 43 percent of Americans favored the law while 54 percent opposed it. But it also found that of those polled, 16 percent opposed the law because they thought that it wasn’t liberal enough. Put another way, 59 percent of Americans support the law or want it to be more liberal.        
Furthermore, a poll released this week by the Pew Research Center found that of the 53 percent of Americans who said they disapproved of the law, the percentage who want elected officials who oppose the law to try to make it work as well as possible was larger than the percentage who wanted them to try to make it fail.        
The American people are not on the far right’s side in battle. House Republicans are on a quixotic mission.        
Sometimes in a fight, you just have to know when your opponent has gotten the better of you, limp home and live to fight another day. But the House Republicans prefer a twisted, last-stand view: face sure defeat in a blaze of glory and be remembered for standing up for what you believe in.        
If only their stance were honorable. There is no glory in this. This is petty and small. This is vindictive and vainglorious. This is what the end of seriousness looks like.

WHITE SETTLEMENT, Tex. — People still gather nightly at the Buddhist temple here, slipping off their shoes and kneeling on the floor of what was once someone’s living room. Their chanting voices slip out the screen door into the muggy Texas night, like the misty sprays of water that keep the patio cool outside.        


But there were frequent visitors and interruptions this week: reporters and photographers and F.B.I. agents, some of whom sat in their suits beneath the patio mist interviewing temple members.        
Here, Aaron Alexis — Texas Buddhist, former Navy reservist and the man, the authorities say, who killed 12 people Monday at the Washington Navy Yard before being shot dead by the police — prayed and volunteered and lived when he rented the house behind the temple.        
Mr. Alexis became an adopted member of White Settlement’s microscopic community of Thai immigrants — the temple has about 50 regular members — that has quietly and anonymously thrived in this working-class town west of Fort Worth in an area dominated by conservative Christians.        
The shooting rampage at the navy yard shattered that anonymity and brought reporters and investigators in search of clues to Mr. Alexis’ life and motive.        
The leader of the temple, Kasem Pundisto, a monk from Samut Songkhram, Thailand, said Mr. Alexis attended services and prayed regularly at the temple beginning in 2010, but more recently visited only occasionally. Mr. Alexis helped paint the decorative designs on a wooden gazebo-style structure in the parking lot, a place for members to socialize. Several months ago, he asked to borrow Mr. Pundisto’s vehicle because his own had broken down. Mr. Pundisto let him use it for days at a time.        
Mr. Pundisto — who wears sandals and dark orange robes, has a shaved head and can speak only a few words of English — pointed to his vehicle. It was a black pickup truck, the Texas Everyman’s preferred mode of transportation. White Settlement’s Thai world is like that: It has an eclectic Texas quality.        
The temple, a one-story house that was converted to a place of worship six years ago and filled with statues of Buddha and tigers, has a sign posted outside a door: “No alcohol, no firearm,” a warning to Texas Buddhists with state-issued licenses for concealed handguns.        
At the nearby Thai restaurant called the Happy Bowl, the Bangkok-born owner — Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, 31, a friend of Mr. Alexis’ — has decorated his establishment with framed drawings and pictures of cats and butterflies and, atop one counter, Dallas Cowboys action figures.        
Mr. Alexis lived in Fort Worth and White Settlement — where Thai immigrants first arrived in the 1990s, drawn by the cheap housing — off and on since 2010. Much of his world in White Settlement was contained in a few blocks: the Happy Bowl, the barber shop next to it, the temple and the house behind it that he rented from a member.        
The temple, called Wat Busayadhammavanaram Meditation Center, has been reeling not only from the attention, but also from the shock of learning that someone who embraced the peaceful traditions of Buddhism had waged such violence.        
Mr. Pundisto sat on the patio, sipping black coffee as Sam Gambir translated. Mr. Pundisto is a hands-on monk. When reporters arrived at the temple, he was using a leaf blower in the parking lot. Later, he dragged a heavy jack through the dirt to a tool shed. But the spiritual world remains his focus.        
“His duty is to serve Buddha,” Mr. Gambir said of Mr. Pundisto.        
Mr. Gambir, 47, of White Settlement, also Thai and the owner of two gas stations, had met Mr. Alexis at the temple. He said many of the regular temple members own Thai restaurants, dry cleaners or other small businesses in the area. Mr. Suthamtewakul still visits the temple, but he converted to Christianity after arriving in Texas, and his wife, Kristi, is also Christian. Mr. Gambir said he considers himself a Dallas Cowboys fan, and enjoys listening to country music.        
“I do love Texas very much,” he said. “But I want to be honest. I don’t like the summer here because it’s real, real bad heat.”        
White Settlement is a town of 16,000. Its name dates to the 1850s, when white settlers considered the area hostile Indian territory. Thai immigrants here have barely registered in census data. Census figures categorize those of Thai descent in White Settlement as “other Asians.”        
There were 31 people in that category in 2000. In 2010, the number had grown to 90, 0.6 percent of the town’s population.        
On the night the F.B.I. agents conducted interviews, a few dozen temple members prayed for Mr. Alexis. They did not mention his name. Had he done something honorable for the community, Mr. Gambir said, they would have done so.

Thursday was quite the day for JPMorgan Chase and its chief executive, Jamie Dimon.        


In the morning, the bank agreed to pay $920 million to four regulatory bodies to settle charges that arose out of the infamous “London whale” trade of 2012, which had already cost the country’s biggest bank some $6 billion in losses.        
Then, in the afternoon, the Office of the Controller of the Currency — the primary regulator of federally chartered banks — and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — a relatively new regulator — announced that JPMorgan would pay fines of $80 million, plus $309 million in restitution, for selling credit card customers bogus services.        
That’s $1.3 billion in fines and restitution in a one day, not to mention strongly worded statements by regulators, an admission of wrongdoing by JPMorgan, and promises by a humbled Dimon to do better.        
How in the world did we get from there to here? “There” was five years ago, when financial cataclysm threatened — and JPMorgan was the one institution that avoided the missteps that brought low so many others. It was heralded as the best-managed bank, with Dimon the best chief executive.        
Now, that same bank, run by that same man, has become a piñata for government regulators; even with Thursday’s settlements, there are still a half-dozen investigations under way. Let me suggest a few possible reasons:        
The bank was never as well-managed at it appeared. On one level, JPMorgan raises the broad question of whether any of the big, sprawling, systemically important banks can truly be managed. But there are also issues that are particular to JPMorgan. The fact that the London whale trades were being marked differently by two areas of the bank suggests that something was seriously awry. Ditto the investigation regulators opened last September, resulting in a cease-and-desist order a few months later, into whether JPMorgan had appropriate safeguards against money laundering. That kind of compliance is part of the blocking and tackling of the banking business. Only now is the bank hiring thousands of compliance officers who should have been in place years ago.        
Unlucky timing. American Banker asked an interesting question the other day: what would have happened if the London Whale trades had taken place in 2009, rather than 2012? Almost certainly, the government’s response wouldn’t have been nearly as severe. “The reason is simple,” said the newspaper. “The government then was more worried about harming the system and did not want to potentially upset markets by assessing large fines.” Another reason, though, is that JPMorgan, for all its troubles, remains immensely profitable, and huge, with well over $2 trillion in assets. The government can make an example out of it without jeopardizing it.        
The regulators are finally getting serious. Yes, it’s true, despite pointing out numerous lapses by senior management at JPMorgan, the government, once again, named no names of senior executives, and indicted two relatively small fry for their actions in the London whale trade. The regulators still have a ways to go — though, they were unusually candid in describing the lapses by the top executives of JPMorgan.        
But look how far they’ve come! What one hears is that there was very little negotiating about the size of the whopping fine. And the Securities and Exchange Commission required an admission of guilt as part of the settlement, which is a very big deal. (Let’s pause and doff our cap to Jed Rakoff, the federal judge who first started complaining about settlements that did not acknowledge guilt — and whose reasoning appears to have persuaded the S.E.C.)        
“The passage of time has allowed the regulators to get their acts together,” says my friend Dan Alpert, managing partner at Westwood Capital, and the author of the coming book, “The Age of Oversupply.” It’s encouraging, for instance, to see the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency shed its former reputation as the banks’ best friend in Washington, and get tough on the institutions it oversees.        
It’s important to remember why banks are regulated so closely. It’s not about punishment, or satisfaction. It’s about ensuring that the banks are being run soundly. Banks are not like other companies; a big bank failure can have enormous economic consequences, as we saw in 2008.        
“I think the key to safe and sound banking is to hold the boards and senior management accountable,” says Karen Petrou, the managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics. “This is first time of which I’m aware it’s been done.”        
She added, “Largely because so much else went unpunished, JPMorgan ended up holding the bag.”        
“But better late than never,” Petrou said.

A little while ago, I was browsing Craigslist during one of my many daily breaks from writing. Every sentence or so, I have to do something else. I’m not a Craigslist frequenter, and I wasn’t entirely sure where to look, so I typed in “writer,” and looked at the daily job postings.        


One entry was different. An anonymous donor named River Whisper loved the arts, and wanted to give $10,000 for just one poem.        
For years, every summer, I’ve been writing my life in poems.        
On the day of the Craigslist diversion, my poem was “Pre-Used”:        
And now, at this pointinsane moment of age and longingcusp and pinnaclewhen my arms are different armswhen my dreams are always interruptedlonging becomes more than longingI can no longer do thisor that as much as I still want toI wake up wondering howI no longer care so much about whywhen a day is not just a day but right now. 
Contestants were told to upload their poem and include a brief cover letter explaining what they would do with the prize money. I also had to write a few sentences about myself and my theme. I’m getting older. That’s my theme. It didn’t need much more explanation. With the $10,000, I would write more poems.        
A few weeks later, close to midnight on a Tuesday, a mysterious e-mail arrived.        
“Congratulations!        
“You have been selected as one of the 11 finalists chosen from the hundreds of entries we received. We would like to meet you this Friday, July 26th along with the other finalists at 5PM.”        
The note gave an address in Chelsea, near the High Line.        
“Dinner and drinks will be served,” it went on.        
“We would like to discuss your poem and get to know you better on Friday. After this step, we will choose the winner.        
“Once again, congratulations.”        
It was signed, “River and Whisper.”        
Now the questions presented themselves: Was this contest real? Should I go? Was this some sort of Nigerian e-mail fraud? Was River Whisper one person, as it seemed on the Craigslist posting, or two, as this e-mail indicated? Because I know nothing about Craigslist, I called my son, who is 26. “Take a chance,” he said. My husband said go, and so did most of my friends, except one who raised the question of kidnapping. Does anyone kidnap poets? Not for money, certainly. We tried to think of all the possible swindles that this could be, and came up with none.        
Still it was hard not to be nervous, or suspicious. Not to wonder what was actually going on. Who River and Whisper were. Whether any of the other poets would show. I had no way of finding out.        
The Friday of the dinner, a warm New York summer day where the city moves in slow motion, it was hard to think of anything else besides River and Whisper and poems.        
At 4:30, dressed in what I hoped was a suitably poetic outfit, a long dress that made me look as though I could write more than one good poem, I met my husband for a drink at the Half King, an appropriately literary bar near the dinner destination. Friends texted me advice, which was more or less universal: put your husband on speed dial just in case. But just in case of what was impossible to say.        
In front of the modern glass building, expensive and imposing, stood two other poets, easily recognizable. One, a beautiful, very young blond woman, was wearing a diaphanous skirt. The other, a man who looked like a good-natured salesman, wore a dinner-party suit. Nervously, we introduced ourselves.        
The building was one of those spaces that redefine the color white by being even more white than seems possible. We entered an elevator that went right to the third floor, where we were greeted by a tall blond woman who had a clipboard. She didn’t say enter but she could have. The room was modern, and overly bright. If it is possible to have too much daylight, this room did. The space was small and well staffed with servers and helpers of various kinds, and a bar full of enough Champagne for us all to drink more than a bottle or two. Poets began drinking immediately, and attentive servers made sure that we were never without a full glass. A long table held enough finger foods to serve three times our number.        
We found out quickly with the help of the clipboard woman that River and Whisper were two. We were all informed that we were never to know their real names. Their anonymity was this contest’s only rule. River, a nervous Asian man in a T-shirt, walked around to greet us with Whisper, a thin, attractive white woman, much taller than River. River was small and jumpy. Whisper held onto him tenaciously. Whisper was both quiet and bold. They walked through the room to greet all of us, in a shy, tentative way, emphasizing that their anonymity was as important as the poems themselves. Whisper would stop suddenly, seized with unexpected passion, and feel the need to lean over and kiss River in a way that was hard for us nervous poets to ignore. “I’m just crazy about River,” was more or less all she said.

Early in the morning of May 11, 1987, someone smashed through the glass doors of the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, removed a Matisse from a wall and fled.        


All it took was daring and a sledgehammer.        
The whereabouts of the painting, “Le Jardin,” remained a mystery until the work was found last year and made a celebratory trip home in January.        
But law enforcement played no role. The return was facilitated by the Art Loss Register, a London-based company that over the last two decades has evolved into a little-noticed but increasingly integral part of art investigation around the world.        
The brainchild of Julian Radcliffe, an Oxford-educated former risk consultant who speaks of once spying for British intelligence, the Register helps fill a gaping void: billions of dollars’ worth of art is stolen every year, according to an F.B.I. estimate, but law enforcement has too few resources to prioritize finding it.        
For Mr. Radcliffe, whose other company helps recover stolen construction equipment, this presented a natural opportunity. Since it began 22 years ago, the Register has developed one of the most extensive databases of stolen art in the world, enabling it to recover more than $250 million worth of art, earning fees from insurers and theft victims.        
Along the way, the company has drawn criticism from those who say its hardball tactics push ethical, and sometimes legal, boundaries. Even so, the Register continues to count law enforcement agents among its supporters. “To me, they’re very important, a very useful tool,” said Mark Fishstein, the New York City Police Department’s “art cop.”        
Mr. Radcliffe’s company operates in the dim recesses of the art world, where the prevalence of theft, fakery and works of murky provenance has given rise to many businesses that promise to help clients navigate this lucrative but largely unregulated market.        
But for the Register, despite its official-sounding name and pivotal role as a monitor, profits have not come easily, and the company’s future looks increasingly cloudy, threatening a core player in the recovery of stolen art.        
Mr. Radcliffe said that he hopes the Registry will break even this year, but that it has lost money for the last six and has stayed afloat only thanks to his cash infusions. Now the company is losing talent, too.        
During the past year, two key employees resigned; additionally, the company’s general counsel, Christopher A. Marinello, who has been as much a public face of the company as Mr. Radcliffe, says he is leaving at the end of this month, with plans to start a rival business.        
Among the incidents that have drawn criticism, the Register misled a client who wanted to check the provenance of a painting before he purchased it, telling him it was not stolen, when in fact it was, so that he would buy it and unwittingly help the company collect a fee for its retrieval.        
It has been known to pay middlemen and informers for leads on stolen works, a practice that troubles some in law enforcement, who say that it can incite thefts. And the company often behaves like a bounty hunter, charging fees of as much as 20 percent of a work’s value for its return.        
These fees do not bother the insurance companies and other clients that hire the Register to find a work. But the company has approached people and museums with whom it has no relationship. In several cases, people say the Register contacted them, told them of a lead on a stolen work, then refused to divulge any information until the subject agreed to pay a fee.        
Officials at the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Orleans, France, for example, said that the Register approached the museum in 2003, asserting that it had information about an Alfred Sisley painting that had been stolen from the museum. The company said it could retrieve the work if the museum agreed to its fee. Unable to afford the payment, the museum called the police instead. The work was never recovered.        
“Sometimes we have to deal with the fact that, under French law, we could charge them,” said Corinne Chartrelle, the deputy for a French law enforcement unit that tracks stolen art. She was not involved in the Orleans case, but said she knew of similar instances where the Register had tried to leverage its knowledge to extract a fee.        
“They are keeping information to themselves,” she said.

A rancher in Brazil’s Amazon has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for ordering the 2005 killing of an American nun and environmental activist, Dorothy Stang. The rancher, Vitalmiro Bastos de Moura, 43, was declared guilty just before midnight on Thursday, the court in Para State said in a statement. Sister Dorothy, 73, was shot six times outside the town of Anapu, where she worked as an advocate for landless peasants, often criticizing cattle ranchers for seizing land illegally and destroying the rain forest. It was Mr. Moura’s fourth trial because he had appealed previous verdicts. Another local landowner, Regivaldo Galvão, was also found guilty of ordering the nun’s death but was granted a conditional release by the Supreme Court in 2012.

The use of biological markers like fingerprints, faces and irises to identify people is rapidly moving from science fiction to reality. Apple’s latest iPhone, which went on sale this week, can be unlocked with a fingerprint. Users of Android smartphones can unlock their devices with a glance. And the Department of Homeland Security is developing facial recognition technology that would allow it to pinpoint criminals and suspects in large crowds of people with closed-circuit cameras.        


Once so expensive that it was used only by the military or high-tech companies, biometric technology has become so commonplace that even some schools and hospitals are using it. Its adoption could make sensitive information more secure than conventional identification cards or passwords, which can be easily forgotten, lost or hacked. But it also has the potential to undermine privacy, which has been greatly compromised by recent revelations about government surveillance of phone and Internet communications.        
In fact, biometrics are not as safe as is often thought. A 2010 report from the National Research Council concluded that such systems are “inherently fallible” because they identify people within certain degrees of certainty and because biological markers are relatively easy to copy. For example, people leave their fingerprints on everything they touch, which makes those fingerprints available to any determined spy or law enforcement agent. Experts have shown that fingerprints and other markers can be copied, giving hackers and thieves access to private information. And once compromised, fingerprints cannot be reset, like passwords, or replaced, like passports.        
If proper safeguards are not put in place, the use of some biometrics, like facial-recognition technology, can also be used to conduct intrusive surveillance of individuals or groups of people by governments and private companies. Using facial-recognition software to match databases of photos with images from security cameras in public spaces and private buildings can help law enforcement agencies spot and track dangerous criminals. But the same technology can just as easily be abused to target political activists or protesters. Retailers could use such systems to snoop on their customers’ shopping behavior so that they could later target specific ads and offers to those customers. Facebook already uses software to determine whether photos that users upload to the site contain the images of their friends, though the company does let users opt out of the system.        
Even as the use of such technology has expanded rapidly, there has been little public debate about its use. Most federal and state laws do not directly address the collection and use of biological markers by businesses and the government. Some lawmakers, like Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, have asked government agencies and companies like Apple and Facebook to explain how they use biometrics. But Congress must do more by enacting legislation that governs how this technology is used, to make sure it does not compromise privacy rights.

WASHINGTON — F.B.I. analysts are poring through the cellphone and e-mail accounts of Aaron Alexis, the former Navy reservist who the police say killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday.        


In Texas, Florida, New York, Rhode Island and other states, agents have interviewed dozens of co-workers, friends, relatives and people he came in contact with in an attempt to piece together his final weeks. Forensic psychiatrists are building a profile of Mr. Alexis, looking at whether he exhibited traits similar to others who have gone on deadly rampages.        
And investigators are parsing the final conversations of his life, searching for any scrap of information that might provide clues to what may prove an elusive goal: a motive for the shootings.        
A central theory is that Mr. Alexis, who was killed by police officers, might have had a dispute with his employer or co-workers that drove him to violence. Mr. Alexis, who had a history of angry outbursts and run-ins with the law, and whose mental stability had come into question in recent weeks, began shooting people on the fourth floor of the navy yard building. He had been working at the navy yard for about a week as a contractor for a computer services company, the Experts.        
But a senior law enforcement official said no clear evidence had emerged pointing to a workplace dispute that might have caused the rampage. “When we talk to people who have firsthand knowledge, we’re just not finding anything that points to a motive because of his work,” said the official, who wished to remain anonymous, citing the investigation.        
The official added: “In the immediate aftermath there is always a lot of hearsay. Some say they overheard this or that. But there is no requirement that something had to provoke him. When you are dealing with crazy people, sometimes there isn’t a clear-cut reason.”        
A spokesman for the Experts asserted earlier this week that the company never told Mr. Alexis that his job was in trouble. ""He was continuously employed from July until Monday,” said the spokesman, Lou Colasuonno. “He didn’t have a work issue.”        
F.B.I. agents have also spent time at the Florida headquarters of the Experts, poring through personnel records and interviewing company officials about Mr. Alexis, who worked there on and off for the past year.        
The company’s handling of Mr. Alexis in his final weeks has come into question because he told police in Rhode Island last month that he was disturbed by vibrations sent by a microwave machine. The company told hotel workers that it would bring Mr. Alexis “home” because he was “unstable,” but it is unclear what the company did.        
On Friday, Pentagon officials also said they thought that the company’s chief executive, Thomas Hoshko, might have been trying to solicit business from the Department of Defense in an e-mail sent to several Pentagon officials the day after the shootings.        
The e-mail expresses Mr. Hoshko’s condolences and “disbelief” that the gunman worked for his company. But he also offers his services in a review of how security clearances and background checks are conducted on government employees and contractors. That review was ordered by President Obama after the shooting.        
“I would like to offer my service, expertise and knowledge with security,” Mr. Hoshko said in the e-mail, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. “I am confident that I can provide valuable input and solutions to the process that will provide better security for the military contractors and civilians.”        
The Experts declined to comment on the e-mail.        
While the victims’ families and members of Congress are demanding answers to what set off Mr. Alexis, current and former federal law enforcement officials said that in terrorist attacks and mass shootings — particularly ones in which the perpetrators are mentally ill and have been killed — investigators often never come to a definitive conclusion about motive.        
Law enforcement officials pointed to recent attacks — like the Boston Marathon bombings and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Conn. — as examples of how despite extensive investigations, the authorities still struggle to find answers.        
Kenneth J. Maxwell, a retired F.B.I. official who was previously in charge of the bureau’s counterterrorism branch in New York, said that when the authorities are “confronted with a tragedy of these proportions and there is a lone actor at the center of it, the focus is building an understanding of everything about the immediate history of this person: his education, his medical and psychological history, his electronic trail.”        
“Was he in debt well, well over his head?” Mr. Maxwell said. “Did he have failed relationships that added to the bizarre nature of this thing? They’re going to ask everything about this person on a personal level.”

ATLANTA — This time, Henrik Stenson’s golf bag contained less than a full complement of clubs for 18 holes, rather than just on the final hole.        


But who needs a complete set of sticks when you are faultlessly swinging whichever one you fetch?        
Minus his 4-wood, whose head caved in during warm-ups on Friday, Stenson added a four-under-par 66 to his first round of 64 at the Tour Championship. Halfway through, his lead is four strokes over Adam Scott, putting Stenson within sniffing distance of the tournament and the FedEx Cup points championships, which would enrich him by a combined $11.4 million.        
“I care more about the two trophies than I do the $11 million, that’s for sure,” Stenson said.        
The clubhouse dressing quarters, along with Stenson’s driver, were safe for another day. Last weekend in Chicago, he broke the club on the final hole and then demolished a locker in an extended fit of pique.        
Circumstances were different Friday. Innocent practice shots damaged Stenson’s 4-wood, leading to its removal from his bag. Its absence reduced his club choices to 13, but it was hardly missed. Stenson said he might have used it only once anyway.        
“Worked out fine without it,” he said. “No harm done.”        
Hauling it around might have harmed Stenson’s score. After his round, the rules staff, which apparently was tipped off by a television viewer who observed the scene at the driving range, informed him that toting a “nonconforming” club carries a two-shot penalty — and deploying it brings disqualification.        
“Good thing that we put it in the locker before we teed off,” Stenson said.        
Form has held, to a degree. Stenson, of Sweden, and Scott, of Australia, pulled into East Lake Golf Club ranked second and third in Cup points, each tantalizingly close to the $10 million bonus that goes to its winner.        
Ahead of them was Tiger Woods, but he seemed dead in the water for both titles when his tee shot Friday on No. 17 met the same fate.        
Woods, after a dreadful, birdie-free first round that buried him in next-to-last place, poked back into contention by skating through 13 holes in five under par.        
Then his approach shot on the 14th found sand, condemning him to a double bogey. It got worse three holes later, when his drive vanished into a lake. Almost as culpable was a botched chip shot that preceded a triple bogey, ultimately leaving Woods tied for 26th, 14 strokes behind.        
Woods, who declined to comment to the news media Thursday, was no more inclined Friday, muttering to his caddie, “Why don’t you talk to them?”        
Yet he stepped onto the interview podium and let down his guard, admitting to physical fatigue. A balky back has gripped him for much of the season.        
“It’s been just a long, long grind,” he said.        
Regarding his wayward drive on the 17th, Woods said: “My legs were just tired. I didn’t rotate through the ball, and I turned it over. Same thing I did over on 14.”        
“I put everything I had in that start and didn’t have much at the end,” he said. “Just ran out of gas.”        
With no cut for the compact field of 30, Woods must refuel for two more rounds. There was no concession speech. He was encouraged by his improved greens literacy, which helped reduce his total putts by six after he persistently misread them Thursday.        
“There’s 36 holes remaining,” he said, delivering a self-directed pep talk. “That’s why we play four rounds. This is not a sprint. It’s a marathon.”        
For the panting Woods, East Lake is only his 16th tour stop of the season, the same number played by a healthier Scott, who said this week, “If I tell you I’m feeling tired this year, you can slap me across the face.”        
Scott, who will be paired with Stenson on Saturday for the second straight round, expressed confidence enough “in my own striking to not be intimidated by Henrik’s good ball-striking.”        
Of greater concern to Scott should be his history of fading at East Lake. Since taking the 2006 Tour Championship, he is an aggregate 12 under in the opening two rounds and six over in the closing two rounds.        
For the 20-year-old Jordan Spieth, who stands third at five under, this season’s tournament load is more than twice his previous high. But Spieth brims with so much vitality that he was nearly trotting up the course’s hills Friday, spurring his caddie to keep up.        
“I think I’m just so still stoked about being at this tournament, what it means,” he said.        
As long as a certain former president is not added to the field, Spieth, a Texan, cannot imagine feeling intimidated. Asked if he was ever awe-struck, Spieth said, “First time I played golf with George W. Bush, probably.”        
After two days of utopian weather, a stormy Saturday looms. The third round has been moved up an hour to 7:30 a.m., with the field grouped in threesomes instead of the usual duos.

In the latest snub to the International Criminal Court by an African government, Ivory Coast has decided it will not send Simone Gbagbo, left, the wife of former President Laurent Gbagbo, to the court in The Hague to stand trial with Mr. Gbagbo on charges of crimes against humanity.        


The charges are related to a civil war that erupted in 2010 after Mr. Gbagbo refused to leave office despite losing a runoff election. The government said Friday that the country’s own courts had been “rehabilitated” after the war and were now capable of granting Mrs. Gbagbo a “fair and equitable trial.”        
But Ivory Coast remains politically divided, too much so to try Mrs. Gbagbo calmly, in the view of some human rights officials. The civil war was fomented partly by Mrs. Gbagbo, according to the I.C.C., which issued an arrest warrant for her in February 2012.        
Several African nations have recently threatened to withdraw from the I.C.C., with Ivory Coast becoming the latest to question, indirectly, the court’s jurisdiction in Africa.

Israeli soldiers manhandled a European diplomat on Friday and seized a truck full of tents and emergency aid a group of diplomats had been trying to deliver to Palestinians whose homes were demolished this week in Khirbet al-Makhul, a community in the occupied West Bank. Soldiers reportedly threw sound grenades to drive away the diplomats, aid workers and residents, and yanked a French diplomat, Marion Castaing, out of the truck before driving it away. Residents said the Israeli Army demolished the homes on Monday after Israel’s high court ruled that they did not have proper building permits. The army said Friday that security forces had tried to prevent tents from being erected, in accordance with the ruling. “At the site, Palestinians and the foreign activists violently objected, throwing stones and striking law enforcement officers,” a military spokeswoman said. “Reports that foreign diplomats abused their diplomatic privileges are currently being reviewed.” Diplomats from France, Britain, Spain, Ireland, Australia and the European Union’s political office were at the site.

In the aftermath of the gun rampage at the Washington Navy Yard that killed 12 Americans just blocks from Capitol Hill, President Obama expressed dismay that “this becomes a ritual that we go through every three, four months.”        


By “this” he meant not just the horrific mass shootings but the tens of thousands of other gun deaths each year — all of them with an all-too-familiar aftermath: shock, followed by words and prayers of sympathy, followed by a complete unwillingness in official Washington “to take some basic actions” to better protect the public.        
The ineffectualness of Washington’s politicians was palpable after this week’s assault. The Senate had already failed miserably to approve modest new gun restrictions despite public outrage over the massacre of 20 schoolchildren and 6 educators in Connecticut last December. The tacit, cynical question now was whether 12 more victims could contribute anything new to the equation.        
Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, said he had to be assured of enough votes for gun restrictions (which seems totally unlikely) before he would even try again. Steny Hoyer, the House Democratic minority whip, pointed to the recent voters’ recall of two Colorado state legislators because of their support for gun controls. “It does not bode well,” Mr. Hoyer said, for another Congressional effort to control what he called “access to weapons that can be used to kill a lot of people quickly.”        
The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said that Mr. Obama would not accept the gruesome spates of gun violence as “the new normal.” Yet as the president himself observed, both the gun mayhem and the ritual that follows are beginning to seem all too predictable.

Having agreed this week to pay $920 million in fines to resolve federal and international investigations into its $6 billion “London Whale” trading loss, JPMorgan Chase has reportedly reached “some closure” in the case and is ready, in the words of its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, to move forward in a process of “simplifying” the bank.        


While JPMorgan may feel some closure, there is scant closure for the American public, which deserves accountability for bank recklessness that continues to endanger the economy and which understands that without accountability true financial reform is impossible.        
Under the settlements, JPMorgan will pay fines that amount to very little for a bank that earned $6.5 billion in the last quarter alone. It has also admitted to violating securities laws on corporate governance and internal controls. The Securities and Exchange Commission rightly extracted the admissions as a condition of settlement. But unless federal prosecutors follow up with charges against the bank or its officers under the Sarbanes-Oxley accounting law or other federal statutes, those concessions are mostly an embarrassment. They are not, in themselves, punishment for past improper conduct and are unlikely to deter future bad behavior.        
The bank has escaped more serious charges of lying to investors and regulators, evidence of which was presented in an earlier Congressional investigation and is even broached in the settlements’ narrative of events, with regulators making references to “senior management” withholding information from the bank’s board and from regulators. If board members and regulators were misled, it stands to reason that investors were also wrongly kept in the dark.        
As for the “senior management,” no actions were taken against any individuals and no executives were named in the settlements. But five were identified by title, some of whom are still at the bank — including the former chief financial officer, who is now a vice chairman, and Mr. Dimon.        
The S.E.C. as well as federal prosecutors and the F.B.I. in Manhattan are reportedly still investigating the losses. Unfortunately, their records in pursuing big banks and top bankers are poor.        
Mr. Dimon said this year that he exhorted the bank’s executives and managers to be forthcoming and diligent in facing up to the London Whale losses as they came to light. That response misses the point: executives have to be held responsible for the disastrous results that arise out of bad management.        
The London Whale settlements open the door to the possibility of other investigations that can lead to real accountability, but whether regulators and prosecutors will follow through remains a question.

Lionel Shriver, an American novelist who lives in England, told a reporter recently that she was considering applying for citizenship in her adopted country, in part to be eligible for the Man Booker Prize, which historically has been limited to citizens of the Commonwealth. She may be relieved to learn that she needn’t take the trouble.        


The Booker Prize Foundation announced on Wednesday that it would open the contest in 2014 to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. Jonathan Taylor, the chairman of the foundation, said in a statement that he expected the move to enhance the Man Booker’s “prestige and reputation,” adding that barring Americans and other English-language writers was “rather as if the Chinese were excluded from the Olympics.”        
As rumors trickled out before the announcement, some in the literary world warned that the expansion would dilute the character of the prestigious award. Jim Crace, who’s on the 2013 Man Booker shortlist of finalists for his novel “Harvest,” said the new parameters would offer a greater overview of English-language literature but would also result in a less focused prize. “I’m very fond of the sense of the Commonwealth,” he said. “There’s something in there that you would lose if you open it up to American authors.” And Susan Hill, shortlisted in 1972, asked, “Why can’t we have a prize of our own?”        
But the Man Booker wasn’t actually well focused before the shift in policy. It allowed writers from all 54 countries in the Commonwealth as well as Ireland and Zimbabwe — in other words, English-speaking nations plus some non-English-speaking nations (Cyprus, for example), minus the United States.        
Three of this year’s six shortlisted authors live and work in America. A fourth, Jhumpa Lahiri, resides in Rome but is an Indian-American who moved to Rhode Island from London as a child. It’s silly that Ms. Lahiri was eligible for consideration but Ms. Shriver, who published a new novel this summer, was not. It’s perfectly reasonable for Ms. Shriver to be allowed to compete in the future.

SAN FRANCISCO — With a huge lead and the rival skipper Jimmy Spithill swearing at the helm of Oracle Team USA’s yacht, Emirates Team New Zealand looked as if it had finally managed to end a decade of frustration and collective soul-searching to bring the America’s Cup back to the island nation where sailors are superstars.         
No such luck.        
Instead, it turned into yet another day on San Francisco Bay that stretched the limits of credulity and the Kiwis’ patience and ended with them still — yes, still — needing just one victory to win the Auld Mug. They lead, 8-3.        
It is tough enough at this stage to beat the improving Oracle team, which is gaining in speed and confidence, but the need to beat Oracle and the Bay Area wind deities is making the task even harder.        
At least one race was postponed because of too much wind on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. But Friday’s obstacle was too little wind, and although Team New Zealand was ahead by close to a mile at one late stage, the race that would have won them the Cup was abandoned with their AC72 nearing the penultimate mark because it had exceeded the 40-minute time limit.        
“It’s better to be lucky than good, isn’t it?” said Ben Ainslie, Oracle’s tactician. “We were obviously staring down the barrel of defeat.”        
When the race was stopped, the Kiwis were perhaps less than three minutes of sailing time away from the finish and a national celebration. But like Gatsby and the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock, they were left staring across the water.        
“It’s obviously tough on the guys; they put a lot into the race,” said Dean Barker, Team New Zealand’s soft-spoken skipper and helmsman. “We weren’t thinking about the time limit until we realized in that second downwind leg that it was going to become an issue. I think it’s about being able to put it behind you. You can cry or you can laugh and get on with it. And we did, we got back into it.”        
So they did, with Barker and the Kiwis holding off the ultra-aggressive Spithill to win the start in the next race and then round the first mark with a slight lead. But the rest of this wind-shifting, mood-shifting race day belonged to Oracle.        
The American team took the lead farther down the leg after using its starboard advantage to get a penalty on Team New Zealand as the two big AC72s jibed and race officials ruled that Team New Zealand, still out in front, did not leave Oracle quite enough room to cross unencumbered.        
At the bottom mark, Oracle outwitted and outmaneuvered the Kiwis again, rounding with a 20-second advantage and then building on it during the upwind leg and finally crossing the finish line 1 minute 24 seconds in front, and — just to be clear on a muddle of a day — well within the 40-minute time limit at 27 minutes and 20 seconds.        
“I’m speechless, and it’s hard for me to be speechless,” said Ken Read, the former America’s Cup helmsman, of the Kiwis. “I can’t feel worse for these guys.”        
Time limits are a staple of sailboat racing, and America’s Cup races were called off for exceeding the time in 1977 and 1983.        
But Bob Fisher, an America’s Cup historian from Britain, said there had never been a race called off with a team needing just one victory to win.        
Fisher termed the 40-minute time limit “a bit ridiculous.        
“It is a bit low for a light-air race around that track,” he said of San Francisco Bay. “They were doing at times 20 knots and plus, and if they couldn’t finish in that, it doesn’t give them much of a break, does it?”        
Iain Murray, the regatta director and former America’s Cup sailor, said that the teams had unanimously agreed to the 40-minute limit last year, which Barker acknowledged through the pain.        
“It would have been nice to have another 10 minutes,” Barker said. “Look, today was a very unusual day on San Francisco Bay. I think it’s the first time we’ve sailed out there when it’s been that light all day. So I think with all the thoughts on timing and to get two races in a day, to do that in a set time to work around TV and things, it needed to have a definitive end so that you could actually guarantee you’d be able to get two races.”        
As Barker spoke in the postrace news conference, Spithill, as usual, was sitting next to him. They are talented, two-in-a-generation helmsmen from the Southern Hemisphere — Spithill is from Australia — but they are also longtime rivals and disparate personalities. Spithill is more outspoken, direct and openly combative, Barker more understated.        
Team New Zealand dominated the early stages of this regatta, taking an 8-1 lead on Wednesday. But Oracle has won two in a row, and though the Kiwis remain heavy favorites, Spithill is taking every public opportunity to remind Barker that the momentum is shifting.        
“We’re in a battle now and honestly we both want to kill each other, and that’s sport and that’s battle,” he said. “I think we’ve both got a lot of respect for each other, and it’s one hell of a fight.”        
Asked to rank the aggression level on a scale of 1 to 10, Barker answered “12.”        
Spithill answered: “12, 15, 20. It’s just full throttle for us. We don’t have an option.”

LOS ANGELES — California is challenging the historic status of American citizenship with measures to permit noncitizens to sit on juries and monitor polls for elections in which they cannot vote and to open the practice of law even to those here illegally. It is the leading edge of a national trend that includes granting drivers’ licenses and in-state tuition to illegal immigrants in some states and that suggests legal residency could evolve into an appealing option should immigration legislation fail to produce a path to citizenship.        


With 3.5 million noncitizens who are legal permanent residents in California, some view the changes as an acknowledgment of who is living here and the need to require some public service of them. But the new laws raise profound questions about which rights and responsibilities rightly belong to citizens over residents.        
“What is more basic to our society than being able to judge your fellow citizens?” asked Jessica A. Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, referring to jury service. “We’re absolutely going to the bedrock of things here and stretching what we used to think of as limits.”        
One new state law allows legal permanent residents to monitor polls during elections, help translate instructions and offer other assistance to voting citizens. And immigrants who were brought into the country illegally by their parents will be able to practice law here, something no other states allow.        
In many ways, the new measures underscore the lock Democrats have over the State Capitol, where they hold an overwhelming majority in both houses. Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed the poll worker legislation this month and has indicated his approval of the other bills. Many of the changes, including granting drivers’ licenses to unauthorized immigrants, passed with overwhelming support and the backing of several Republicans.        
State legislatures across the country approved a host of new immigrant-friendly measures this year, a striking change from just three years ago, when many states appeared poised to follow Arizona’s lead to enact strict laws aimed at curbing illegal immigration. More than a dozen states now grant illegal immigrants in-state college tuition, and nine states and the District of Columbia also allow them to obtain drivers’ licenses.        
With an estimated 2.5 million illegal immigrants living in California — more than in any other state in the country — some say the state has no choice but to find additional ways to integrate immigrants.        
“It’s a recognition that how people are living and working in their community might trump their formal legal status,” said Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “There is an argument that in parts of California a jury without a legal permanent resident is not really a jury of peers. Some view citizenship as the final consecration of complete integration, but this says, ‘Let’s take who we have and get them to participate in our civil institutions.’ ”        
Early this month, the State Supreme Court suggested during a hearing that lawmakers could create a law to address the case of Sergio Garcia, who was brought to the United States illegally as a child. Mr. Garcia had met every other requirement to become a licensed lawyer. Within days, legislation was approved to allow immigrants who were brought here illegally as minors to obtain law licenses, with just three opposing votes.        
But the bill to allow noncitizens to sit on juries has proved more controversial. Several newspaper editorials have urged Mr. Brown to veto it.        
Rocky Chávez, a Republican assemblyman from northern San Diego County, said that allowing noncitizens to serve on a jury would make it harder to uphold American standards of law.        
“What we call domestic violence is appropriate in other countries, so the question becomes, ‘How do we enforce our own social norms?’ ” Mr. Chávez said. He added that granting more privileges would weaken immigrants’ desires to become citizens. “Once we erase all these distinctions, what’s next? What is going to convince someone it is essential to get citizenship?”

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration’s potentially pathbreaking proposal for carbon emission limits on new power plants will face political and legal challenges from opponents who argue that the technology needed has not been close to being proven as the law requires.        


The draft rule was announced on Friday at the National Press Club by Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. But to protect industries from pie-in-the-sky requirements, current law limits what rules the agency can make.        
E.P.A. rules sometimes demand technological advancements, but the goals that the agency establishes have to be met by techniques that existing law describes as “adequately demonstrated.”        
The proposal would limit new gas-fired power plants to 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt-hour and new coal plants to 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide. Industry officials say the average advanced coal plant currently emits about 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour. A megawatt-hour is a little more than a typical American household uses in a month.        
Once the rule is in place, new plants would be required to capture carbon dioxide from the smokestacks and “sequester” it underground. Officials said the regulation could be completed by the fall of 2014.        
But, utilities say, laws governing underground disposal were not written with carbon dioxide in mind, and sequestration is in a legal quagmire.        
Three systems of carbon capture are in various stages of development. The most common is to convert coal into a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide — which in this context is a fuel, not a pollutant — and carbon dioxide, and to recover the carbon dioxide at two different stages.        
Another method, demonstrated by the utility American Electric Power in recent years at its Mountaineer plant in West Virginia, is to burn coal conventionally and use an ammonia process to grab the carbon dioxide out of the flue gas. And if coal is burned in nearly pure oxygen, the flue gases are nearly pure carbon dioxide.        
In the last few days, Ms. McCarthy has referred to several early-stage carbon capture projects as a sign that industry can build the needed equipment. In testimony on Wednesday before the House Energy and Power Subcommittee, Ms. McCarthy cited four such projects. She told reporters on Friday that the draft rule was based on “technologies that are already entering the market and being constructed in plants today.” But the four she referred to in the committee hearing ranged from under construction to planned. None of them would sequester the carbon dioxide, and all would sell it.        
The closest to opening is the Southern Company’s Kemper County plant in Mississippi, which will convert coal to gases and then filter out some of the carbon dioxide, reducing emissions by about 65 percent.        
But the plant, at $5 billion, is $1 billion over budget. Southern Company said in a statement on Friday that the plant’s economics were peculiar to its location, and not a national model. Its captured carbon will be sold for use in the oil fields, where it helps force more oil to the surface.        
But most power plants are not in areas where they can sell their carbon dioxide.        
Revis W. James, director of the Energy Technology Assessment Center at the Electric Power Research Institute, said that before a technology could be considered commercially demonstrated, “you’d need Kemper to be operational and a couple more Kempers, and have the kinks worked out.”        
Carbon capture and sequestration, he said, was unlikely to be competitive unless natural gas prices increased by 100 to 150 percent and the construction of nuclear plants was ruled out.        
Ms. McCarthy also referred to three projects that would sell carbon dioxide to the oil industry: a coal plant in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the Boundary Dam project, where the provincial utility plans to rebuild a small 45-year-old unit to capture carbon dioxide; the Texas Clean Energy Project, 15 miles west of Odessa, where the builders hope to soon break ground; and Hydrogen Energy California, proposed for the oil fields of Kern County.        
As the price of oil has risen, so has the value of carbon dioxide to oil drillers. The value as a carbon-reduction mechanism is unclear, though, because the result is to produce more oil, all of which will be burned, producing more carbon emissions.        
E.P.A. officials say that a carbon-emissions rule would push improvements in the technology. Two decades ago when the agency required technology to reduce emissions of a different pollutant — nitrogen oxides, a smog precursor — that, too, was expensive and not thoroughly demonstrated, but today it is routine, they said.        
The biggest carbon-capture project to date was at the American Electric Power’s Mountaineer plant in New Haven, W.Va. But Nicholas K. Akins, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said that technology was “definitely not ready for prime time.”        
Mountaineer was a pilot project. Equipping the whole plant would have cost $1 billion, he said, and driven up costs per kilowatt-hour by 60 to 80 percent. The company eventually shut down the effort because it could not recover the costs from its customers. And injection of carbon dioxide into the earth was only possible because it was classified as a research project, he said.        
Mr. Akins and other industry executives say that a rule governing new coal plants would have little impact because of the low price of natural gas. “No one in their right mind is going to start a coal unit at this point,” he said.        
But they fear it will become a precedent for limits on existing plants. Rules on smog, mercury and other pollutants are accelerating the retirement of many old coal plants, and a rule on carbon dioxide would hit many more, they say.        
Many of the environmental groups that applauded the E.P.A.’s proposed standard appear to agree. They took pains to note that coal plants also emit a variety of smog-forming and toxic chemicals, and that suppressing new plants because of their carbon dioxide emissions would have the effect of reducing the other emissions, too.        
On the other side, Senator Mitch McConnell, who is from coal-dependent Kentucky, promised to prevent the measure from being carried out. “The president’s decision today is an escalation of the war on coal,” he said.

A company that buys cattle hides, just outside Bellingham, Wash., has been doing business with one of its Canadian suppliers, West Coast Reduction, for decades. One particular transaction this summer went awry and far afield.        


West Coast Reduction sent a truckload of hides to the buyer, Friese Hide and Tallow. That’s about 550 or 600 hides, to be sorted, processed and graded.        
“When they come to us,” said the owner, Roger Kennedy, “they’re all mixed up.” Friese then ships the hides, usually to the Far East, where they are turned into leather.        
Friese paid for the load of hides with a check for $37,080, issued June 21. The check went out with the mail that night, Mr. Kennedy said on Friday. He does not know which mailbox in town was used. “The gal’s on vacation that would have taken it in,” he said.        
The United States Postal Service said mail from Bellingham would probably be sent to Seattle for sorting, then to its recipient in Vancouver, British Columbia.        
Not this time.        
Several days passed, and Friese received a call from a fraud investigator at Sovereign Bank. The investigator asked whether Friese had written the check for $37,080. Yes, he was told.        
The check seemed to have made a detour east of about 2,900 miles, to Brooklyn, and, the police said, into the hands of a 19-year-old from Crown Heights with no discernible background in the procurement and sale of cattle hides.        
On July 3, 12 days after the check was mailed in Washington, the teenager entered a branch of Sovereign Bank on Montague Street in Downtown Brooklyn, the police said. He opened a new account under the name West Coast Reduction, and “provided a notarized business certificate” that said he was conducting business under that company’s name, according to a criminal complaint filed later by prosecutors.        
He deposited the check and left, the complaint states.        
Something about the transaction attracted the attention of the Sovereign fraud investigator. There are safeguards set up to catch fraudulent business paperwork like that described in the complaint. Sovereign put a flag on the account. And waited.        
July ended, and August came and went, with the $37,080 just sitting there.        
Finally, last week, the 19-year-old returned.        
On Sept. 13, he “did attempt to withdraw the entire balance” of the account, the criminal complaint states. Bank security approached the young man, and someone called 911. A patrol officer in the area arrived at the bank and arrested him.        
The suspect was identified as Christopher Mulligan of Prospect Place. He was charged with grand larceny, possession of stolen property and falsifying business records. After his arrest and a court appearance, he was released on his own recognizance. The investigation is continuing. Mr. Mulligan’s lawyer did not return calls for comment. The bank declined to comment.        
How did the check end up in Brooklyn? Was it stolen in the mail? Mistakenly sent to Crown Heights?        
A spokeswoman for the United States Postal Inspection Service said the agency was not investigating the matter. “We’re just doing some fact-finding,” she said.        
A man who said he was Mr. Mulligan, responding to a note on his door, called me on Thursday. He shed little light.        
“I don’t know anything about no check,” he said.        
The bank has video of him opening the account with the check on July 3, according to the criminal complaint.        
“They said they had me on video,” he said. “It’s not me.”        
He said a friend had sent him to the bank. “All he told me to do is open a business account, and that’s what I did,” he said, as if everyone were asked to do that sort of thing.        
Why did he wait so long before returning to the bank? The delay, more than two months, suggests a cool degree of patience, but that may not be entirely accurate.        
Mr. Mulligan has a history of marijuana-related arrests, and when he was charged with possession and sale over the summer, in between the bank visits, he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, the Brooklyn district attorney’s office said. Mr. Mulligan said he spent “about a month” at Rikers Island for it.        
It is not hard to imagine a young jail inmate passing the time during his incarceration daydreaming about the nice nest egg waiting for him in the downtown Sovereign Bank branch, but Mr. Mulligan said that was not entirely accurate either. He said he did not want all that money.        
“I just wanted to take out $1,000,” he said.

A former Staten Island man was sentenced to 13 years in prison on Friday for lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his attempts to join the Taliban or Al Qaeda to wage violent jihad against the United States.        


Prosecutors in United States District Court in Brooklyn had sought the maximum 21 years behind bars for the man, Abdel Hameed Shehadeh, arguing that he was following a proven formula of other would-be, homegrown terrorists who succeeded in aligning themselves with extremist groups by traveling to Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan.        
Judge Eric N. Vitaliano imposed the lesser term, however, after suggesting the defendant proved too inept to pull it off.        
Mr. Shehadeh, 23, appeared in court with his long hair in a ponytail. He spoke briefly, telling the judge a letter he had written asking for leniency expressed his position.        
His outlook on jihad “has matured over time,” he wrote.        
“Jihad and terrorism are not synonymous, they are conflicting in my view.”        
The letter portrayed his failed attempt to get to Pakistan as “an impulsive move” by a misguided young man.        
Mr. Shehadeh also said that while he was under investigation, he had provided the F.B.I. with valuable information on aspiring jihadists he knew from a mosque in Brooklyn. Among them were Najibullah Zazi, Zarein Ahmedzay and Adis Medunjanin, all convicted in a failed plot to attack the New York City subway system as suicide bombers in 2009.        
He offered “information on persons who shortly thereafter were arrested on terrorism charges,” Mr. Shehadeh said. But, he added, “I was never credited for my information.”        
Prosecutors said in court papers that Mr. Shehadeh knew Mr. Medunjanin. But they also insisted his information did not advance the investigation of the subway plot.        
A jury convicted Mr. Shehadeh earlier this year after hearing some of his friends testify that he spoke of wanting to die while waging violent jihad, or holy war, abroad against the American military. They said Mr. Shehadeh, an American citizen, had hoped to attend a terrorist training camp in Pakistan.        
Mr. Shehadeh first drew the attention of federal investigators in 2008 when he bought a one-way plane ticket to Islamabad. Pakistani officials would not allow him into the country, and he returned to New York.        
Prosecutors said that when members of the F.B.I. and the New York Police Department’s joint terrorism task force interviewed him about the trip, he lied by saying he had tried to travel to Pakistan to “study Islamic law.”        
Four months later, Mr. Shehadeh went to a Times Square military recruiting station and tried to sign up, the authorities said. A friend with whom he had worshiped later told investigators that Mr. Shehadeh had hoped the Army would deploy him to Iraq, where he could desert and join insurgent forces.

The day after Jonathan Sanchez was released from prison in 2010 after serving three years for a burglary, he walked into Down East Seafood in Hunts Point in the South Bronx and asked for a job, and a second chance. He got both.        


But now Mr. Sanchez must document the past he has tried to leave behind, in an 11-page application for a photo identification card issued by a city agency that is responsible for ferreting out organized crime. He is one of hundreds of food workers who have come under scrutiny in recent years by the agency, the New York City Business Integrity Commission, not because of any known ties to mob bosses but simply because they work for a company in Hunts Point.        
The commission, which regulates the wholesale meat, seafood and produce markets operating on city-owned land in Hunts Point, has increasingly looked outside those markets to companies on private property nearby. Since 2009, the agency has registered 54 companies in the area adjoining the markets and has collected applications for background checks and identification cards from their employees.        
The applications ask for detailed personal information, like the names and addresses of former spouses, every residence over the past decade and any criminal offenses or testimony given in criminal and civil investigations. If workers refuse to complete the applications or do not carry their identification cards, their employers can face heavy fines.        
“This was my brand new start,” said Mr. Sanchez, 26, who makes $40,000 a year packing lobster orders.        
Mr. Sanchez said he worried that his past crime will follow him from job to job and brand him as an ex-con. “I feel violated because I don’t think those things have to be asked,” he said. “I feel that it could stigmatize me.”        
The applications have also raised concerns among recent immigrants who fear their information could be shared with other government agencies, and have drawn protests from many companies that see the requirements as an unnecessary burden. More than three dozen local companies voiced complaints about the commission last week at a meeting organized by the Greater Hunts Point Chamber of Commerce, which represents about 700 local businesses.        
“When people hear this, they don’t want to move here,” said Josephine Infante, president of the chamber, who said the commission continued to perpetuate a negative image of Hunts Point. “They think there must be a criminal element here, when in fact the environment has truly changed.”        
The commission, created in 2001 to consolidate earlier efforts to combat organized crime in the wholesale food markets, commercial garbage hauling and shipboard gambling, has long collected personal information about those working in the markets. The applications and other requirements have been a sore point for the Hunts Point wholesale produce market, which recently cited the commission’s regulatory efforts as a reason that it was unable to come to terms with the city on a new long-term lease.        
Commission officials said they started focusing on workers outside the public markets in 2009, after a state court decision mandating equal treatment of companies inside and outside the market walls. They added that they stepped up their efforts this year after receiving an anonymous complaint that many companies had not complied with the registration and identification cards.        
Shari C. Hyman, the commissioner of the Business Integrity Commission, said her agency sought to ensure a safe, fair and competitive business climate for all food companies in Hunts Point. Since 2011, the agency has closed three companies outside the markets with ties to the Genovese crime family, and a fourth company whose owner was found to have embezzled from a former employer.        
“Requiring the application is a balancing act,” she said, “one that requires us to look at the information collected in the most narrowly focused way so that corruptive influences are kept at bay, business needs are met and a clear path to employment for those who need it most is provided.”        
The commission charges each company $4,000 to register, which is good for three years, and an additional $100 per employee for the identification cards. Commission officials said the fees covered the cost of reviewing the applications and performing background investigations of the companies and their staffs.        
At Il Forno, a bakery that paid $7,000 for its registration and identification cards, many of the workers said they were intimidated by all the questions about their backgrounds.        
“It’s not right,” Ramon Eduardo, the owner, said. “They’re acting like immigration, but I think immigration would ask you less questions.”

BEIJING — For almost two years, hackers based in Shanghai went after one foreign defense contractor after another, at least 20 in all. Their target, according to an American cybersecurity company that monitored the attacks, was the technology behind the United States’ clear lead in military drones.        


“I believe this is the largest campaign we’ve seen that has been focused on drone technology,” said Darien Kindlund, manager of threat intelligence at the company, FireEye, based in California. “It seems to align pretty well with the focus of the Chinese government to build up their own drone technology capabilities.”        
The hacking operation, conducted by a group called “Comment Crew,” was one of the most recent signs of the ambitions of China’s drone development program. The government and military are striving to put China at the forefront of drone manufacturing, for their own use and for export, and have made an all-out push to gather domestic and international technology to support the program.        
Foreign Ministry officials have said China does not sanction hacking, and is itself a victim, but another American cybersecurity company has tracked members of Comment Crew to a building of the People’s Liberation Army outside Shanghai.        
China is now dispatching its own drones into potential combat arenas. Every major arms manufacturer in China has a research center devoted to drones, according to Chinese and foreign military analysts. Those companies have shown off dozens of models to potential foreign buyers at international air shows.        
Chinese officials this month sent a drone near disputed islands administered by Japan; debated using a weaponized drone last year to kill a criminal suspect in Myanmar; and sold homemade drones resembling the Predator, an American model, to other countries for less than a million dollars each. Meanwhile, online photographs reveal a stealth combat drone, the Lijian, or Stealth Sword, in a runway test in May.        
Military analysts say China has long tried to replicate foreign drone designs. Some Chinese drones appearing at recent air shows have closely resembled foreign ones. Ian M. Easton, a military analyst at the Project 2049 Institute in Virginia, said cyberespionage was one tool in an extensive effort over years to purchase or develop drones domestically using all available technology, foreign and domestic.        
Chinese engineers and officials have done reverse engineering, studied open source material and debriefed American drone experts who attend conferences and other meetings in China. “This can save them years of design work and mistakes,” Mr. Easton said.        
The Chinese military has not released statistics on the size of its drone fleet, but a Taiwan Defense Ministry report said that as of mid-2011, the Chinese Air Force alone had more than 280 drone units, and analysts say the other branches have thousands, which means China’s fleet count is second only to the 7,000 or so of the United States. “The military significance of China’s move into unmanned systems is alarming,” said a 2012 report by the Defense Science Board, a Pentagon advisory committee.        
China’s domestic security apparatus, whose $124 billion official budget this year is larger than that of the military, is also keenly interested in drones, which raises questions about the potential use of drones for surveillance and possibly even attacks inside China, including in restive areas of Xinjiang and Tibet. Drone technology conferences here are attended by both military and domestic security officials. An international conference on nonmilitary drones is scheduled to take place in Beijing from Sept. 25 to 28.        
A signal moment in China’s drone use came on Sept. 9, when the navy sent a surveillance drone near the disputed Diaoyu Islands, which Japan administers and calls the Senkakus. Japanese interceptor jets scrambled to confront it. This was the first time China had ever deployed a drone over the East China Sea. The Chinese Defense Ministry said “regular drills” had taken place “at relevant areas in the East China Sea, which conform to relevant international laws and practices.”        
The drone appeared to be a BZK-005, a long-range aircraft used by the Chinese Navy that made its public debut in 2006 at China’s air show in Zhuhai, said an American official.        
Mr. Easton said deploying the drone near disputed waters and islands “was very much a first” for China and had caught Japanese officials off guard.        
“I think this is really just the beginning of a much broader trend we’re going to see — for China to increase its ability to monitor the East China Sea and the Western Pacific, beyond the Philippines, and to increase the operational envelope of their strike capabilities,” he said.        
The Chinese military, with its constant focus on potential war over Taiwan and an eye on China’s growing territorial disputes, is at the vanguard of preparing drones for use in maritime situations. That is unlike the United States, which has used drones to hunt and kill suspected terrorists and guerrilla fighters, mostly in Pakistan and Afghanistan.        
American drones “are not designed to enter into contested or denied air space,” Mr. Easton said. “So they would be unable to fight in any conflict with China.”        
China, on the other hand, is building drones, also called unmanned aerial vehicles, precisely to operate in contested spaces. “It’s a very useful instrument for safeguarding maritime sovereignty,” said Xu Guangyu, a retired major general and director of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association. “China will gradually step up its use of U.A.V.’s in this area.”

SANTA MONICA, Calif. — It would seem to be a good time to own an electric car in Santa Monica. From the charging stations dotted around town to the dedicated public parking spaces — all provided at no cost by the city — Santa Monica has rolled out the welcome mat for electric cars.        


But even here, in this wealthy, environmentally conscious city of 90,000 west of Los Angeles, only a core group of owners has switched from traditional gasoline-powered cars.        
Less than 4 percent of registered cars run only on battery power, according to an analysis by the industry researcher Edmunds.com of data from R.L. Polk, which records vehicle registrations nationwide. Hybrids, which run on some combination of gasoline and battery power, account for 15.5 percent, the data says, but many of those are traditional hybrids, which do not require a plug-in cord for recharging.        
RoseMary Regalbuto, a Santa Monica resident, bought a Ford C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid this year for the two-mile commute between her home and her office, where she is chief executive of Meals on Wheels West.        
She wanted to reduce emissions and spend less on gas but said that going fully electric was too risky, especially for longer work trips to downtown Los Angeles or cities like Santa Clarita about 30 miles north.        
“I wouldn’t necessarily be able to plug in on the other end,” she said.        
The car gets 22 miles on a charge. Ms. Regalbuto has filled her tank only twice in the 2,200 miles she has put on the odometer, charging at home every other night. When she or her husband, who drives a Ford Fusion plug-in hybrid, run the air-conditioning at home while charging their cars, the fuse blows, she said.        
For now, automakers’ push to sell electric cars “has sparked sales to early adopters but has failed to encourage mainstream consumers,” said Jean François Tremblay, director at Ernst & Young’s Global Automotive Center.        
Higher sticker prices (even after a $7,500 tax credit), shorter ranges and a lack of a national network of charging stations are among the reasons consumers are shying away from buying electric vehicles in favor of gasoline engines, Mr. Tremblay said.        
For automakers, the reluctance underscores how difficult it will be for them to meet strict federal and state mandates on fuel efficiency and pollution over the next 12 years.        
California’s law to reduce pollution, for example, requires that 15.4 percent of automakers’ vehicles be powered by alternative technology by 2025. As a result, some automakers are producing electric vehicles just for California and a handful of other states. That includes the electric versions of the Honda Fit and Fiat 500. And the federal government is requiring automakers to nearly double their vehicles’ average fuel economy by 2025.        
Santa Monica would seem like the ideal market. With an average household income of more than $71,000, its residents can afford the higher upfront cost of electric cars. City officials have also tried to make it easy to own them. Four years ago, even before the all-electric Nissan Leaf was released, the city began a push to install public charging stations at its parking lots, shopping centers and streets downtown, where it offers electricity free. Today, Santa Monica has 42 charging stations, with 80 more on the way by early next year.        
The city offers free parking to any vehicle displaying the state-issued sticker that allows access to the car pool lanes, and the Santa Monica city government has also made it easier for residents to install chargers at home by waiving electric permit fees and speeding up the approval process.        
“We’ve worked to make it an over-the-counter process,” said Dean Kubani, director of the city’s Office of Sustainability and the Environment.        
The city, known as a surfing haven, also has one of the strongest environmental records in the nation. In 1982, it created one of the first municipal curbside recycling programs, and it has led other California cities in a ban on plastic bags at drugstores and supermarkets.        
“Santa Monica has a long history of progressive politics,” Mr. Kubani said. “It’s attracted the type of person who tends to support environmental policy.”        
The efforts to encourage electric-car ownership are bearing some fruit here compared with the rest of the nation. The city’s registration rate of 3.6 percent for all-electric cars is the highest in the United States, outside of two towns in Silicon Valley. About 90 percent of the municipal fleet runs on alternative fuels, including natural gas, biodiesel and battery power.

As the race for New York City mayor turns toward November’s general election, Bill de Blasio has a modest fund-raising advantage over Joseph J. Lhota, according to new campaign finance filings.        


Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has at least $700,000 in his campaign account that he can use for the general election, according to a filing on Friday. Mr. Lhota, a Republican, has about $500,000.        
With the Nov. 5 general election still more than six weeks away, the difference in fund-raising is relatively small. But Mr. Lhota, already facing long odds against Mr. de Blasio, can ill afford to fall further behind.        
Mr. Lhota also faces the challenge of convincing possible donors about the viability of his candidacy. Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans in New York City, and two polls released this week showed Mr. de Blasio leading Mr. Lhota by more than 40 points among likely voters.        
The two candidates have been on even footing since the primary on Sept. 10. In the six days that followed, Mr. de Blasio raised about $147,000 toward his general election campaign, and Mr. Lhota collected about $144,000.        
Both candidates are participating in the city’s public matching funds program. To receive public money, they must limit their spending on the general election to $6.4 million.        
Over all, Mr. de Blasio has about $1.2 million on hand, according to his filing. But he raised more than $500,000 for a possible runoff, and he is not allowed to use that money in the general election, according to the city’s Campaign Finance Board.        
Asked this week about his fund-raising, Mr. Lhota acknowledged that Mr. de Blasio was ahead of him but predicted he would soon catch up, and said he was confident he would raise enough money to spend the full amount permitted.        
“I think that we’ll be on parity,” Mr. Lhota said. “I’m not that far behind from where he is now, and I feel very comfortable that I will be able to raise the maximum amount that I’m allowed to raise to be able to prosecute a very, very vigorous campaign.”        
Mr. Lhota also stands to benefit from the spending of a political action committee that formed to support his candidacy, and earlier this month it reported receiving $290,000 from the billionaire David H. Koch and his wife, Julia Koch.        
The committee, New Yorkers for Proven Leadership, did not report receiving any additional contributions as of Monday. But a spokesman, Michael McKeon, said the group had seen “a significant pickup in interest, and that has started to translate into support,” and on Friday night it released a new television commercial praising Mr. Lhota.

NEW YORK — Alex Rodriguez's record-breaking grand slam was a big one for the Yankees, who can only hope it came in time for a last-gasp run at the playoffs.        


Rodriguez set a major league mark with his 24th career slam, passing Lou Gehrig with a tiebreaking shot in the seventh inning that sent New York to a 5-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Friday night.        
""It means I'm getting old,"" said Rodriguez, 38. ""It's hard to think about things like that right now. We're really on a sprint to the end here and every win is huge for us.""        
A-Rod's drive helped CC Sabathia (14-13) beat Tim Lincecum in a matchup of former Cy Young Award winners having subpar seasons.        
More importantly for the Yankees, it carried them to their second win in seven games as they cling to faint playoff hopes.        
New York, which has eight games remaining, pulled within three of the second AL wild card — with three other teams in between. The Indians' 2-1 rain-shortened win over Houston, moved them a half-game ahead of Texas, which began the day tied with Tampa Bay atop the standings but lost 2-1 to Kansas City. The Rays beat Baltimore in 18 innings to keep the lead.        
""It's an unbelievable accomplishment and it's a big one for us,"" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ""I don't know if we can afford to lose any more games.""        
Alfonso Soriano also homered and New York opened its final homestand with a much-needed victory, hours after pitcher Andy Pettitte announced his plans to retire — again — following this season.        
The news about Pettitte hardly came as a surprise, but the 41-year-old lefty put to rest any speculation he might be back next season. Pettitte, who stepped off the mound for a year before returning in 2012, is scheduled to start the series finale Sunday — the same day the Yankees will honor retiring closer Mariano Rivera in a pregame ceremony.        
Rookie outfielder Juan Perez, back home in the Bronx, hit an RBI double for the Giants. The defending World Series champions have spent all week in New York — they took two of three from the Mets at Citi Field, where a large throng of vocal San Francisco fans made them feel right at home.        
Giants rooters came out in the Bronx, too, easy to spot in their orange or black jerseys. An audible chant of ""Let's go Giants!"" quickly drew boos from Yankees fans in the crowd of 41,734.        
""There's a lot of Giants fans here. I noticed that. They travel well,"" Rodriguez said.        
With the score tied at 1, Eduardo Nunez grounded a single through the right side to start the seventh. Lincecum (10-14) hit Brendan Ryan with a pitch and walked Ichiro Suzuki with two outs, loading the bases and ending the right-hander's night.        
Rodriguez, hampered by a sore leg lately, reached out and lofted a 2-1 pitch from George Kontos toward the hitter-friendly dimensions in right field for his 654th career homer and seventh this season.        
""Just tough to watch and tough to put somebody in that kind of situation,"" Lincecum said. ""Just wasted a lot of pitches that inning, didn't attack the zone as much as the previous six, and I felt like I could've gotten out of that better than what happened.""        
The hit snapped a 1-for-25 slide for A-Rod, who returned Aug. 5 from hip surgery. It was his 14th slam for the Yankees, moving him ahead of Joe DiMaggio for second place on the franchise list behind Gehrig.        
""I'm a huge fan of Lou Gehrig, everything he's done, going back to his college days in New York,"" Rodriguez said. ""He's kind of the gold standard for a Yankee. Special moment. I'll think about it someday.""        
Sabathia was pulled after a leadoff single in the eighth and walked off to a warm ovation. David Robertson got Perez to ground into a double play, and Rivera worked a perfect ninth.        
But it was Rodriguez who delivered the big blow.        
""Unbelievable — especially at that moment. He came up big for us again,"" Sabathia said. ""Hopefully we can just keep getting big hits like that and keep winning games.""        
Lincecum, who had won four straight decisions, was looking for his first five-game winning streak since early in the 2010 season. He was charged with four runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings. He threw 66 of 121 pitches for strikes.        
""He pitched great,"" manager Bruce Bochy said. ""It's some tough luck there in that last inning.""        
NOTES: Giants CF Angel Pagan was rested in favor of Perez. ... DH Buster Posey singled in the sixth to end a 1-for-23 skid on the road trip. ... Rodriguez's previous slam came in Atlanta on June 12 last year. ... Looking to spark his struggling lineup, Girardi moved a slumping Suzuki into the leadoff spot, partly because he had faced Lincecum several times in the past few years. ... LHP Boone Logan (elbow) was available, Girardi said. ... After the Yankees got in late following Thursday night's loss at Toronto, C Chris Stewart was rested in favor of rookie J.R. Murphy. ""Physically, I just think it's too hard,"" Girardi said.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The 0-2 Giants found a ray of hope this week in the knowledge that their last such start came in 2007, when they swept their next six games and went on to win Super Bowl XLII. The belief that they can repeat such a turnaround could hinge on how they fare Sunday against quarterback Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers, an opponent they are meeting at a familiar time and place.        


The Giants traveled to Charlotte, N.C., with a 1-1 record in their third regular-season game last year. They used a 36-7 thumping of the Panthers to start a torrid stretch in which they won five of six games. That helped lead to a winning record (9-7) but not a playoff berth.        
“There has to be a sense of urgency,” defensive end Justin Tuck said of this year’s slow start, “because we are not getting those two games back.”        
Any sense of déjà vu surrounding Sunday’s kickoff in Charlotte ends for the Giants with the absence of running back Andre Brown. Against the Panthers on Sept. 20, 2012, Brown carried 20 times for 113 yards and 2 touchdowns. He and the rest of the Giants’ offense played the best possible defense against Newton by keeping him off the field; the Giants dominated the time of possession, keeping the ball for 36 minutes 10 seconds.        
This year, Brown is on injured reserve until mid-November with a broken left leg. The Giants have missed his hard-charging style. With their aging offensive line struggling to create running lanes, they have 33 rushing attempts for 73 yards, a meager 36.5 yards per game.        
It appears the defense will also be lacking a key figure: cornerback Corey Webster is listed as doubtful after missing Friday’s practice with a hip injury. Aaron Ross is expected to make his first start for the Giants since Super Bowl XLVI to close the 2011 season. He left as a free agent to sign with Jacksonville but played only one year with the Jaguars before he was released.        
Ross said that he had not been told he would start but that he would embrace the opportunity. “I love to play. I love to compete. I’m a fierce competitor,” he said. “Any time I have a chance to go out there, I’m excited.”        
Ross, drafted by the Giants in the first round in 2007, said he had always been ready to rejoin the lineup. He said of his study habits: “It’s the same as it is every week. I go in preparing like I’m a starter, because you never know what is going to happen.”        
Ross hurried into action in the season-opening 36-31 loss at the Dallas Cowboys when Prince Amukamara collided with safety Ryan Mundy and sustained a concussion. Ross held up well against Tony Romo, the Cowboys’ elusive passer.        
“We’re not looking for any kind of letdown,” safety Antrel Rolle said of the probable lineup change. “We’re looking for Ross to play ball as he did against Dallas.”        
No matter the circumstances, the Giants expressed confidence they could defeat the Panthers if they repeated the success they had last year against Newton, the first player taken in the 2011 draft and one of the game’s most dynamic players.        
The Giants held Newton to 16-of-30 passing for 242 yards and intercepted him three times. Although Newton is difficult to tackle at 6 feet 5 inches and 245 pounds, the Giants limited his effectiveness as a ball carrier by taking a double-digit lead. He rushed six times for 6 yards, including his team’s only touchdown. It came in the third quarter, after the visitors had built a 23-0 lead.        
It was a rare poor afternoon for Newton, who became the only player in N.F.L. history to pass for more than 8,000 yards (8,045) and 40 touchdowns (41) while running for more than 1,000 yards (1,045) and 20 touchdowns (22) in his first 33 games. He passed for 3,869 yards and rushed for 741 yards and 8 touchdowns last year, when he became the first quarterback to lead his team in rushing since Donovan McNabb paced the Philadelphia Eagles in 2000.        
“He is a special athlete,” Mundy said. “He can bring the ball down and get 5 yards or he can get 70 yards.”        
Although the Giants have only two sacks, defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka said he thought they could turn up the pressure against Newton. “Everybody knows about his feet and when he escapes the pocket, that he can still look down the field and he can make people miss,” Kiwanuka said. “So our job will be to push the pocket, get people up in his face and make sure we get him down on the ground.”        
EXTRA POINTS        
Hakeem Nicks was given an excused absence from practice so he could attend to personal matters. Nicks was expected back for Sunday’s game. ... Coach Tom Coughlin continued to keep focus on the game rather than on the death of his younger brother, John, who will be buried Tuesday. Asked how his players had rallied around him, Coughlin said: “Let’s not go there, please. Everybody’s working hard to get where we want to be.”

Federal health regulators will begin tracking millions of medical devices, from pacemakers to hip replacements, using a new electronic system meant to protect patients by catching problematic implants earlier. The Food and Drug Administration published new rules on Friday that require most medical devices sold in the United States to carry a unique code, identifying the make, manufacture date and lot number. The codes will be stored in a publicly accessible database to help regulators, doctors and companies monitor safety issues with devices. The tracking system has been promoted by doctors and public safety advocates for years. “The rule that came out today is a victory for patients, hospitals and clinicians,” said Josh Rising, director of Pew Charitable Trusts’ medical device initiative. “Up until now, medical devices were among the only products on the market that could not be uniquely identified.” The tracking system follows years of highly publicized recalls involving defibrillators, artificial hips and drug pumps that have been plagued by design and manufacturing flaws.

First came Aeropostale, the clothing store chain that caters to teenagers. Then Shake Shack, the trendy Manhattan fast-food chain, started flipping hamburgers on a prime corner. Last year the Gap opened with its Factory Store, and an Armani Exchange followed. In July, lines snaked around the block for a new steel-and-glass H&M, the chain known for its modestly priced clothing inspired by fashion runways. Nordstrom Rack, Century 21 and Swarovski are on the way.        


Fulton Street, Downtown Brooklyn’s clamorous bazaar, is transforming, leading the borough’s political and business minds to ask: Can the street — New York City’s third busiest shopping district after Herald Square and a stretch of Madison Avenue — accommodate such sleek emporiums without killing off the more ragtag independent shops that sell hip-hop fashion, cellphones, sneakers and gold jewelry?        
Their disappearance, some worry, would alter the distinctive street flavor that draws African-American and Caribbean-American customers.        
Rondell Antoine, who is from Grenada, is a regular shopper at the Fulton Mall, as an eight-block stretch of the street is known. For shape-hugging, flamboyant dresses she shops at the street’s smaller, less tidy, unique stores like Stellar European Design.        
“Some of these styles are unique to Caribbean women — bright colors and styles that let them show off their physique,” said Ms. Antoine, 34, as she scanned the dresses crowding the store’s walls up to the ceiling. But she is also delighted with the chain stores that have moved into the area.        
The owner of Stellar European Design, however, Sam-Yung Kim, an immigrant from South Korea, looks upon the new stores as a menace. They are, he said, driving up rents beyond $200 a square foot that may make it impossible for him to remain when his lease comes up for renewal in a year. “Next door closed,” he said. “Store next to that closed.”        
Some worry that the loss of smaller stores may drive out the current clientele, which is largely black.        
“What’s being engineered now is the replacement of one population by another to capitalize on the luxury housing boom that rezoning made possible,” said Lucas Shapiro, a senior organizer for Families United for Racial and Economic Equality, which has opposed much of the development set off by a 2004 zoning change that permitted taller office and residential buildings.        
The Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, which manages the neighborhood’s three business improvement districts, said that the demographics of the block had essentially not shifted and that the new stores are just as popular with the street’s traditional customers.        
“Retailers are going where the shoppers are,” Tucker Reed, the partnership’s president, said. “They’re not making decisions based on the color of the shoppers’ skin, but by where there’s demand for a product.”        
Marty Markowitz, the departing borough president, said the new chains were returning the street to its peak mid-20th century years, when it had half a dozen department stores like Abraham & Straus and Mays that catered to both Brooklyn’s more affluent residents and those looking to stretch a dollar.        
“H&M is the first wave of the diverse shopping experience of Fulton Street,” he said. “When I was a boy, there were opportunities at every income level. My mom used to drag me to Mays at the lower end and A&S at the upper end.”        
Mr. Shapiro said that recent development had already pushed out more than 100 smaller businesses that provided a solid livelihood for merchants, an option for lower-income shoppers and hundreds of jobs to young strivers.        
“For people of color, it’s been such a successful economic model,” he said.        
Fulton Street has been Brooklyn’s marketplace since the early 19th century. At its peak it had half a dozen department stores, but in the 1970s and 1980s, it became somewhat raffish, the scene of news-making robberies and shootings. Still, it drew working-class families shopping for shoes, televisions and clothing.

D. J. R. Bruckner, a retired book and theater critic for The New York Times who was previously a nationally syndicated political columnist for The Los Angeles Times, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 79.        


The cause was complications of cancer, his cousin Steve Langan said.        
At The New York Times, where he was on staff from 1981 to 2005, Mr. Bruckner’s official job was as an editor at the Book Review. But his byline appeared hundreds of times during his tenure, not only on book reviews but also on reviews of Off and Off Off Broadway theater and the occasional film.        
A polymath and polyglot (the languages in which he was fluent included Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and those were merely the ancient ones), Mr. Bruckner was known for his stylistic prowess.        
It was evident in his first article for The Times, an essay about grand-scale publishing projects, which appeared in the Book Review in 1981. In it, he described a series of ecclesiastical volumes issued over the course of a century by a Benedictine abbey in France, “in ivory vellum covers, like a long procession of robed abbots.”        
Mr. Bruckner could consign a subject to eternal damnation with a single image. Reviewing an Arnold Schwarzenegger film in 1985, he wrote, “Mr. Schwarzenegger first appears in ‘Commando’ in parts — one huge bicep and then another.”        
He could praise with the lavish economy of a single word. Reviewing a 1995 production of Edward Albee’s play “Seascape,” which requires actors to impersonate lizards, Mr. Bruckner lauded their “lizardry.”        
Donald Jerome Raphael Bruckner was born in Omaha on Nov. 26, 1933. He earned a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and English from Creighton University and, as a Rhodes scholar, a master’s in classics and English from Oxford.        
Mr. Bruckner was a reporter on The Chicago Sun-Times in the early 1960s, covering labor. He joined The Los Angeles Times in the mid-’60s, serving as its Chicago bureau chief before becoming a syndicated columnist for the paper.        
In one widely quoted column, from 1972, Mr. Bruckner lamented what he saw as a hardening despair among young black Americans. “There are issues enough,” he wrote. “What is gone is the popular passion for them. Possibly, hope is gone.” He went on: “In the light of what government is doing, you might well expect young blacks to lose hope in the power elites, but this is something different — a cold personal indifference, a separation of man from man. What you hear and see is not rage, but injury, a withering of expectations.”        
For his liberal positions, Mr. Bruckner was accorded a spot on President Richard M. Nixon’s enemies list.        
Before joining The New York Times, Mr. Bruckner was a vice president for public affairs at the University of Chicago.        
Mr. Bruckner, a Manhattan resident, was the author of several books, including “Frederic Goudy” (1990), about the type designer.        
No immediate family members survive.        
One of Mr. Bruckner’s most personal articles was an essay on bibliomania published in the Book Review in 1982.        
“Two years ago, needing to get rid of 600 volumes, I decided to sell duplicates,” he wrote. “Who needs two sets of Goethe in six volumes? But I’d made different notes in each set: no sale.” He added: “I did cull out duplicates from thousands of pieces of poetry I had bought since the 1950s — broadsides, pamphlets, little books bought for 50 cents or $1 years back. When a dealer named his price, I was stunned: If some had appreciated 300 percent in 15 years, what might they be worth when I am old? But I steeled myself and sold them — and then fell ill for a day.”

NEWARK — When the Devils acquired forward Ilya Kovalchuk in 2010 and later signed him to a 15-year contract, he was expected to one day own the team’s offensive records.        


The Devils, and the owner Jeff Vanderbeek, so wanted to build their franchise around Kovalchuk that they accepted severe penalties for initially offering him a 17-year, $102 million deal.        
But just two years into his contract, Kovalchuk exited, retiring from the N.H.L. to play with SKA St. Petersburg in the Kontinental Hockey League and leaving the Devils’ forward lines in a state of flux.        
Weeks later, Vanderbeek sold the club to Josh Harris, the owner of the Philadelphia 76ers. In some ways, it is fitting that Kovalchuk and Vanderbeek departed mere weeks apart. Vanderbeek, a New Jersey native, was the showy owner who got Newark’s shiny Prudential Center built but nearly sank the Devils into bankruptcy in the process.        
Kovalchuk was the limitless offensive threat who helped the Devils reach the 2012 Stanley Cup finals, then returned to his homeland 13 months later.        
Kovalchuk’s departure alone would leave a huge hole. He scored 89 goals after arriving in February 2010, and he was second on the team in points last season (31) despite missing 11 games with a shoulder injury. He had significant ice time, including on special teams, and his mere presence created offensive openings for teammates.        
“You’re not going to go out in UFA and fill an Ilya Kovalchuk,” said Devils forward Ryane Clowe, referring to unrestricted free agency. “There are only so many of those in the world.”        
But couple Kovalchuk’s departure with that of David Clarkson, and his 45 goals over the last two seasons, and the Devils are missing two of their top three scorers from a team that only scored 112 goals and missed the playoffs last year. Clarkson, a Toronto native, bolted for a seven-year, $36.75 million deal with the Maple Leafs.        
Still, the Devils feel poised to surprise critics who say they will not be able to score enough goals this year.        
“We have a good mix of veterans, energy guys and skill guys,” said Patrik Elias, the Devils’ scoring leader from a year ago with 36 points at age 37. “There are a lot of talented guys on this team.”        
Harris brings financial stability, and General Manager Lou Lamoriello went back to basics, aiming to replace Clarkson and Kovalchuk with tough, physical forwards. He re-signed center Adam Henrique to a 6-year, $24 million deal. Henrique and the top-line center Travis Zajac are signed through 2018-19.        
Lamoriello also added Jaromir Jagr, the N.H.L.’s active leader in goals, and Clowe and Michael Ryder, free agents from Newfoundland.        
Ryder and Clowe made their Devils preseason debuts in a 5-3 loss to the Islanders on Thursday and have shared time in practice on the same line. Devils Coach Pete DeBoer acknowledged it was too early to set lineups, but the notion of them playing on the same line would excite some fans in eastern Canada.        
“That hasn’t really happened before, two guys from Newfoundland playing on the same team and the same line,” said Clowe, who played for the Rangers after the trade deadline last season. “I’m sure everyone back home would love to see it.”        
The Devils also signed the 27-year-old forward Damien Brunner to a professional tryout Monday. Brunner was on the ice for three Islanders goals Thursday, but he shared time on the ice with the top forwards Zajac, Dainius Zubrus and Rostislav Olesz. He played with Elias in power-play drills Tuesday, his first full day as a Devil.        
“It’s always nice to be part of a new group and bring some energy,” said Brunner, who had 26 points for the Detroit Red Wings last season, his first in the N.H.L. after starring in his native Switzerland. “The Devils are a first-class organization, you can tell just being here. I hope it all turns out well.”        
The Devils’ power play ranked 21st last season, scoring on 15.9 percent of its chances. The team expects Brunner to help improve that. He is also talented in shootouts, another area the Devils hope to fix. They were 2-7 in shootouts last season.        
“He can make some plays when he has the puck on his stick,” DeBoer said. “There’s a good chance something good is going to happen offensively. We could use a little bit of that.”        
The Devils may have new faces, but they are not young faces. Ryder and Clowe are in their 30s, and Jagr will be 42 in February. Injuries have already bitten the Devils’ forwards. On the first day of training camp last week, Jagr left the ice after 10 minutes with what the team has called lower-body soreness. He has not practiced since, though DeBoer said Friday that Jagr was skating and would return soon.        
Clowe sustained a lower-body injury against the Islanders and did not practice Friday. Forward Mattias Tedenby, 23, left practice Friday with a lower-body injury and did not return. The Devils play the Islanders again Saturday night at Barclays Center in Brooklyn for the first N.H.L. game at the arena, which the Islanders will call home starting in 2015.        
Still, for someone like Tedenby, a former first-round pick who has played just 105 N.H.L. games over three seasons, teaming with a slew of veteran forwards is enormously beneficial. That in turn might be productive for the Devils’ offense down the line.        
“I’m really excited to be around them and play with them,” Tedenby said. “It’s good for younger guys like me who want to get to their level.”

Peter K. Leisure, a federal judge in Manhattan who in 26 years on the bench oversaw high-profile business disputes, trials of Mafia chieftains and political controversies, died on Sept. 17 in Manhattan. He was 84.        


The cause was complications of pneumonia, his longtime judicial assistant, Gloria Rider, said.        
In 1986, Judge Leisure handled the antitrust jury trial pitting the upstart United States Football League against the National Football League. The U.S.F.L., which claimed that the N.F.L. had established a monopoly and persuaded television networks not to broadcast U.S.F.L. games, won a partial victory but was awarded only $1 in damages.        
He also presided over the 1993 racketeering and drug trial that led to the convictions of three members of the Gambino crime family.        
Among Judge Leisure’s more controversial decisions was one related to the McCarthy era. In 1999, over strong objections from the federal government, he ordered the release of secret grand jury testimony in the investigation of Alger Hiss, who had been accused of being a Soviet spy and had been convicted of lying to a Congressional committee. The records included testimony by Richard M. Nixon, then a congressman and a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee.        
“The court is confident that disclosure will fill in important gaps in the existing historical record,” Judge Leisure wrote. “The materials should languish on archival shelves, behind locked doors, no longer.”        
The transcripts showed that Nixon had lobbied grand jurors to indict Hiss and offered suggestions on witnesses to subpoena and questions to ask.        
Peter Keeton Leisure was born in Manhattan on March 21, 1929, and graduated from Yale and the University of Virginia Law School. His father, George S. Leisure, was a founder of Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine, a prominent New York law firm that is now defunct.        
Judge Leisure worked as a federal prosecutor in the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York under Robert M. Morgenthau.        
A burly, congenial man who stood 6-foot-6, Judge Leisure worked in private practice after his stint as a government lawyer. He was a partner at the firms Whitman & Ransom and Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle.        
President Ronald Reagan appointed him a federal judge for the Southern District of New York in 1984 on the recommendation of Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato. He retired in 2010.        
Judge Leisure’s wife of 53 years, Kathleen Blair, survives him, as do two daughters, Mary Blair Adelfang and Kathleen Leisure, and a grandson. A third daughter, Lucille Leisure, predeceased him.

BOSTON — The Boston Red Sox waited four years to get back to baseball's postseason. They were more than happy to put off their playoff celebration one more day.        


One game after securing their first playoff appearance since 2009, the Red Sox clinched the AL East title on Friday night, getting seven strong innings from Jon Lester to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 6-3.        
The victory gave Boston 94 wins, 11 more than the Tampa Bay Rays with only 10 games remaining.        
""We're going back to the playoffs,"" said designated hitter David Ortiz, who joined his teammates in revelry on the mound already wearing a ski mask to protect his eyes from the postgame spray of champagne and beer. ""People have got to believe we've got a good team. We're going to take this all the way there.""        
The Red Sox did little to celebrate after assuring themselves of no worse than a wild-card spot on Thursday. Instead, the team brought out the cigars on Friday after earning their first division title since 2007 — a victory that allows them to skip the one-game wild-card playoff and instead rest for four days after the regular season ends.        
""Winning the American League East is something everybody in here should be proud of,"" said manager John Farrell, who was brought in to replace Bobby Valentine after last year's team won 69 games. ""When we got in the playoffs last night — to see there was no response, there was no celebration. That to me spoke as much volume as anything we've done in the year. It's a focused group. It's their time tonight to go and enjoy it.""        
Lester (15-8) earned his 100th career victory, allowing one run on five hits and two walks while striking out eight to win for the seventh time in nine decisions. Toronto pinch-hitter Adam Lind hit a two-run homer off Junichi Tazawa in the eighth to make it 5-3 before Koji Uehara got five outs for his 20th save.        
With the crowd standing for most of the final inning, Uehara struck out Brett Lawrie to end the game and the Red Sox poured out of the dugout and bullpen. On their way to the mound they were given the traditional commemorative caps, along with T-shirts that said, ""We Own The East.""        
It was a stunning turnaround that came just one year after the Red Sox completed a 13-month collapse that started in September of 2011, when they blew a nine-game lead in the wild card and missed the playoffs with a loss on the final day of the season.        
""They believed it from the first day of spring training,"" owner John Henry said. ""But they went out and did it.""        
Dustin Pedroia had three hits for the Red Sox, who have won 19 of their last 25.        
Toronto starter Esmil Rogers (5-8) did not make it out of the third inning, allowing two runs on three hits and five walks and striking out two while getting only seven outs. With the fourth-place New York Yankees winning their 81st game earlier Friday, the Blue Jays will be the only team in the AL East with a losing record.        
""They've got a great team over there. They really do,"" Toronto manager John Gibbons said. ""They ran away with a good division. It's not even close right now.""        
The Red Sox took the lead early when Pedroia doubled to lead off the first inning, went to third on a fly ball and scored on a wild pitch. Boston had runners on first and second with nobody out but Mike Carp lined out to the shortstop and Ortiz was thrown out at the plate when he tried to score from second on Jarrod Saltalamacchia's single.        
Daniel Nava doubled to lead off the third inning and, after intentionally walking Ortiz, Rogers walked two more to make it 2-0. Chad Jenkins came in and got Saltalamacchia to hit into an inning-ending double play.        
Toronto loaded the bases with nobody out in the fourth on a walk, an error by third baseman Will Middlebrooks and a single. But Middlebrooks fielded Anthony Gose's chopper, stepped on third and threw home to get Kevin Pillar in a rundown for a double play. Lester struck out J.P. Arencibia to end the inning.        
Rajai Davis singled, stole second and third and scored on Lawrie's single to make it 2-1 in the fifth. But Neil Wagner gave up four straight singles to start the seventh, including an RBI single by Ortiz to make it 3-1.        
Jeremy Jeffress came in and got Mike Napoli to ground into a shortstop-to-home-to-first double play. But Carp hit a line drive to left-center that made it 5-1. After Lind made it 5-3, Pedroia added an RBI single in the eighth.        
NOTES: Lester is the 11th pitcher in Red Sox history to record 100 victories, and just the third left-hander. ... Toronto CF Colby Rasmus was beaned by a warmup throw before the bottom of the first inning. He was replaced in the lineup by Pillar. Gibbons said he would get a CT scan. ... Farrell is the seventh manager to lead the Red Sox to the playoffs in his first year on the job. The last was Terry Francona in 2004. ... The Red Sox announced before the game that tickets for AL divisional playoffs to be played in Boston will go on sale Tuesday.

INDIANS 2, ASTROS 1 Zach McAllister (9-9) lasted five innings and host Cleveland got two unearned runs in a rain-shortened victory that moved them into one of the two A.L. wild-card spots. The game was delayed for 1 hour 9 minutes before the umpires decided to call it after six and half innings.        
ROYALS 2, RANGERS 1 Neftali Feliz walked Alcides Escobar on four pitches with the bases loaded and two outs in the eighth inning night, giving host Kansas City a victory.        
TIGERS 12, WHITE SOX 5 Max Scherzer became baseball’s first 20-game winner, pitching through bad weather for six innings to help Detroit to a victory at home. The A.L. Central-leading Tigers lowered their magic number to 3.

The Pirates appeared in control through eight innings as Francisco Liriano overwhelmed the Reds, allowing two runs and three hits, walking three and striking out seven. Cincinnati scored three unearned runs in the ninth off closer Mark Melancon as shortstop Jordy Mercer threw a routine grounder into the stands.        
CARDINALS 7, BREWERS 6 Carlos Beltran’s sacrifice fly in the 10th inning scored Kolten Wong to lift visiting St. Louis, which moved into a two-game lead in the N.L. Central. Matt Adams hit his 15th home run for the Cardinals.        
BRAVES 9, CUBS 5 Chris Johnson went 3 for 4 with a home run as visiting Atlanta reduced its magic number for clinching the National League East title to 1.        
The Braves scored four runs with two outs in the ninth inning to break open a tie game. Brian McCann and Johnson each had a run-scoring single, and Andrelton Simmons followed with a two-run double. Freddie Freeman earlier hit a three-run homer for Atlanta. David Carpenter (4-1) pitched a scoreless eighth to get the win.        
Kevin Gregg (2-5) took the loss for the Cubs, who wasted three home runs.        
Atlanta starter Paul Maholm, twice given a four-run lead, allowed eight hits and four runs in five and a third innings. Chicago’s Scott Baker allowed only four hits in four innings but gave up five runs.        
NATIONALS 8, MARLINS 0 Jordan Zimmermann (19-8) pitched a two-hitter and earned his N.L.-leading 19th win as host Washington clung to its slim playoff hopes.        
The Nationals sent 11 batters to the plate in a seven-run sixth against Marlins starter Jacob Turner (3-8) and reliever Chris Hatcher. Denard Span had two hits in the inning, including a two-run triple, and Jayson Werth and Bryce Harper had back-to-back doubles.        
After hovering near .500 for most of the season, the Nationals, the defending N.L. East champions, have won 29 of 40. They began the day five games behind the Cincinnati Reds for the second wild-card spot, with nine games to play.        
POOL PARTY CRITICIZED Some in Arizona expressed indignation after Adrian Gonzalez and about 20 other Dodgers left their Champagne-soaked clubhouse and jumped into the Chase Field pool after clinching the N.L. West title in Phoenix on Thursday. The Dodgers beat the Diamondbacks, 7-6.        
The Dodgers insisted they meant no disrespect, but Diamondbacks infielder Willie Bloomquist and Senator John McCain of Arizona were among those who criticized the Dodgers on Twitter.        
“Congrats to Dodgers for winning the west — they earned it on the field,” Bloomquist wrote. “I just wasn’t raised to boast in your opponent’s face.”        
McCain had harsher words, writing, “No-class act by a bunch of overpaid, immature, arrogant, spoiled brats!”

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Saturday indefinitely postponed reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War that had been set to start Wednesday, an apparent setback after weeks of improving ties following a spring that saw threats of war.        


North Korea was vague about its decision to call off the six days of reunions, which have not been held in three years, accusing unidentified conservatives in Seoul of a ""reckless and vicious confrontation racket"" against Pyongyang, a claim that North Korea routinely makes. It also vowed, in similarly familiar rhetoric, to ""take strong and decisive counteractions against the South Korean puppet regime's ever-escalating war provocations.""        
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula had been gradually easing, with the North dialing down its war rhetoric and seeking to restart various cooperation projects with South Korea. The biggest highlight is the recent return of North and South Koreans to a jointly run factory park just across the border in North Korea after a five-month shutdown.        
The North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in a statement that the family reunions will be postponed until a ""normal atmosphere"" for dialogue returns. It also said it would postpone any talks on resuming lucrative tours to a mountain resort in the North that were stopped in 2008 after a North Korean soldier shot and killed a South Korean tourist.        
South Korea's Ministry of Unification declined to provide immediate comment.        
The reunions and the other improvements in the rivals' relations had been greeted with relief in Seoul. Many South Koreans have had little or no word about their loved ones for decades. But there has also been wariness and deep mistrust. Analysts say North Korea often follows provocations with charm offensives meant to win much-needed aid and diplomatic concessions.        
The Korean War separated millions of families, and huge numbers of refugees moved both north and south. Most don't even know whether their relatives are still alive because the two countries bar citizens from exchanging mail, phone calls and email.        
Past reunions brought together weeping family members desperate for details and news. They were separated again a few days later. No Korean has received a second chance to meet their relatives, according to South Korean Red Cross officials.

Rabbi Philip Berg, whose Kabbalah Center International put a modern spin on an ancient Jewish mystical tradition, attracting celebrities like Madonna, Demi Moore and Britney Spears but also incurring criticism on spiritual and financial matters, died Monday in Los Angeles. He was 86, according to the center, although some news reports put his age at 84.        


His death, from respiratory failure and pneumonia, was announced by the center.        
A former insurance salesman, Rabbi Berg established the center in Queens with his second wife, Karen, in the early 1980s. The Los Angeles branch, now its headquarters, opened in the mid-1980s, and there are now branches in some 40 cities worldwide.        
The rabbi suffered a stroke in 2004, and since then the organization has been led by Mrs. Berg and the couple’s sons, Yehuda and Michael.        
In an e-mail message to The New York Times on Thursday, Madonna wrote of Rabbi Berg, “I learned more from him than any human I have ever met.”        
She added: “This one concept that he taught me, and that kabbalah teaches, is that you have to take responsibility for your life. You can’t blame other people for what happens. You are in charge of your destiny.”        
Kabbalah, which means tradition in Hebrew, arose in the 12th century among rabbinic sages in Spain and France. A body of commentary on sacred Hebrew writings, primarily the Torah but also early mystical texts, it aims to discern and illuminate hidden meanings within those works.        
Rabbi Berg recast kabbalah in a late-20th-century light by combining it with a New Age focus on self-actualization. Classes offered at the center’s New York branch, for instance, include Power of Kabbalah 1, 2 and 3 and Creating Your Relationships.        
Many mainstream Jewish leaders condemned Rabbi Berg as purveying a diluted version of kabbalah, which was historically considered so complex and powerful that only married men 40 and older who already possessed a deep knowledge of the Torah were allowed to study it.        
But his admirers praise him as having made kabbalah far more widely accessible than it had ever been — to women, young people and even gentiles.        
“It’s a mixed legacy,” Rabbi Arthur Green, rector of the rabbinical school at Hebrew College in Newton Centre, Mass., said on Wednesday.        
On the one hand, Rabbi Green said: “Both Orthodox and liberal Jews accused him of charlatanism and hucksterism. He sold bottles of supposedly blessed water called Kabbalah Water and charged hefty fees to people taking his classes and certainly became quite wealthy, unlike any prior teacher of kabbalah in history.”        
On the other, he said, “There were people who derived great benefit from his teachings, who found their way back to Judaism through him.”        
Besides Kabbalah Water, the center’s most emblematic product is a length of red string ($26); worn around the wrist, the string is said to ward off the evil eye. In 2003, Ms. Spears, wearing the string and a white bustier, appeared on the cover of Entertainment Weekly.        
A major component of the Kabbalah Center is its book-publishing arm, which has released many works by Rabbi Berg, including “The Wheels of a Soul: Reincarnation, Your Life Today — and Tomorrow” (1984) and “Kabbalah: The Star Connection — the Science of Judaic Astrology” (1992).        
“In medieval kabbalah, there’s definitely reincarnation and astrology,” Jody Myers, a professor of religious studies at California State University, Northridge, and the author of “Kabbalah and the Spiritual Quest,” a 2007 book about the center, explained Wednesday. “But Berg gave it central billing.”        
The center’s assets, The Los Angeles Times wrote this week, “are now believed to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.”        
Philip Berg was born Shraga Feivel Gruberger in Brooklyn on Aug. 20, 1927, according to the Kabbalah Center; some sources give the year as 1929. The son of an Orthodox Jewish family, he received rabbinic ordination in 1951 from what is now the Lakewood Yeshiva in Lakewood Township, N.J.        
But before long, wanting to steer a less traditional course, he Americanized his name and became a salesman with the New York Life Insurance Company. He became entranced by kabbalah in the 1960s, on a visit to Israel.        
In 1971, after divorcing his first wife, with whom he had eight children, he married Karen Mulnick. Together they undertook a deep study of kabbalah, living in Israel for much of the 1970s before returning to the United States, where they started a modest incarnation of the center in their home in Queens.        
The Kabbalah Centers functioned fairly quietly until 1996, when Madonna began attending the Los Angeles branch. Over time, they have been patronized by Elizabeth Taylor, Roseanne Barr, Monica Lewinsky and other celebrities as well as many ordinary men and women.        
In 2006, the center became a partner in a charitable project of Madonna’s that sought to build a school in Malawi, in southeast Africa. But as Newsweek reported in 2011, “only $850,000 of the $3.8 million spent on the academy was paid out in Malawi.”        
“The lion’s share, almost $3 million, was spent by the Kabbalah Center’s office in L.A.,” the magazine said.        
In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service began an investigation of the Kabbalah Center’s finances; its scope included the center’s role in the Madonna project, Raising Malawi. An I.R.S. spokesman said the agency could not discuss the status of the investigation.        
Madonna has continued the Raising Malawi project but no longer involves the Kabbalah Center in it.        
Information on Rabbi Berg’s survivors besides Karen Berg and their two sons could not be confirmed.        
In founding the Kabbalah Center, Rabbi Berg appears to have put his finger on a primal longing that is present in even contemporary sophisticates.        
“He tapped into the fact that modern educated people can still be superstitious and still have insecurities and still have needs that were once filled by people who wrote amulets and gave blessings,” Rabbi Green said Wednesday. “And he was willing to do that for people in the modern world.”

Aldon Smith, San Francisco’s All-Pro linebacker, was released from jail Friday after his pickup truck apparently struck a tree, leading to his arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana possession, the authorities said.        


Smith was on the 49ers’ practice field with his teammates later Friday at team headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif. He is scheduled to appear in court Nov. 4.        
It was not clear whether Smith would play Sunday when the 49ers host the Indianapolis Colts.        
Smith, 23, posted $5,250 bail and was released from the Santa Clara County jail late in the morning.        
Smith was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving in Miami Beach in January 2012. He has also been named in a lawsuit by a Northern California man who said he was shot during a party at Smith’s house in San Jose in 2012.        
FOSTER: I WAS PAID IN COLLEGE Houston Texans running back Arian Foster says in a coming documentary that he accepted money during his senior year at Tennessee.        
“Honestly, I don’t know if this will throw us into an N.C.A.A. investigation, but my senior year I was getting money on the side,” Foster says in the Epix documentary. “I really didn’t have any money. I had to either pay the rent or buy some food.”        
Sports Illustrated first reported Foster’s comments in the documentary “Schooled: The Price of College Sports.”        
Foster, who played for the Volunteers from 2005 to 2008, expanded on his comments Friday after the Texans’ practice.        
“I feel very strong about the injustice the N.C.A.A. has been doing for years,” Foster said.        
JETS AND PATRIOTS FINED  The Jets and the Patriots have been fined a combined $88,500 by the league as a result of a sideline skirmish late in their game last week. The fight was set off by Jets center Nick Mangold’s low hit on cornerback Aqib Talib after an interception that sealed New England’s 13-10 victory.        
Jets guard Willie Colon was assessed $34,125 in fines — $26,250 for contact with an official and $7,875 for punching an opponent — and tackle D’Brickashaw Ferguson was fined $15,000 for punching a Patriots player. New England’s Michael Buchanan, Alfonzo Dennard and Vince Wilfork were docked $7,875 each for throwing punches.        
RUSHER’S PENALTY IS A FIRST Jackie Battle of the Tennessee Titans has been fined $21,000, becoming the first running back to be docked for lowering the crown of his helmet into an opponent. A new rule prohibits running backs from delivering blows with the crown of their helmet once they are outside the tackle box.        
Battle hit Houston’s Danieal Manning during the Texans’ 30-24 victory Sunday but was not penalized on the field. He said he planned to appeal the fine.        
SAYERS SUING LEAGUE The Hall of Fame running back Gale Sayers is suing the N.F.L. and the helmet maker Riddell, claiming they failed to prevent repeated head injuries that caused him to sustain brain damage.        
In the lawsuit, filed in United States District Court in Chicago, Sayers, who played for the Bears from 1965 to 1972, claims he has headaches, occasional short-term memory loss and other cognitive deficits. He says the affliction is caused by chronic traumatic encephalopathy.        
An N.F.L. spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment, and Riddell, based in Rosemont, Ill., declined to comment.        
Last month, in a deal with the players union, the N.F.L. agreed to pay $765 million to settle lawsuits from thousands of former players who developed concussion-related health problems.

PITTSBURGH — Joey Votto homered off Kyle Farnsworth in the 10th inning and the Cincinnati Reds edged Pittsburgh 6-5 Friday night to pull even with the Pirates for the top wild-card spot in the National League.        


Cincinnati pushed across three unearned runs in the ninth off Pittsburgh closer Mark Melancon to tie it and Votto won it an inning later when his fly to left field reached the first row of seats for his 24th homer of the season.        
JJ Hoover (5-5) earned the win for the Reds, who have won four straight. Aroldis Chapman worked the 10th for his 38th save.        
Farnsworth (1-1) retired Brandon Phillips to start the 10th but left fielder Starling Marte couldn't quite grab Votto's shot down the line and the Reds started a pivotal three-game series with a stunning victory.        
The Pirates appeared firmly in control through eight innings. Francisco Liriano overwhelmed the Reds, allowing two runs on three hits, walking three and striking out seven. The left-hander needed only 94 pitches to record 24 outs, but was pulled in the ninth for Melancon, who has been outstanding most of the season but was coming off a blown save in a 3-2 loss to San Diego on Wednesday.        
Things didn't get any better 48 hours later.        
Melancon sandwiched outs around a single by Ryan Ludwick before things started to unravel. Todd Frazier reached when shortstop Jordy Mercer threw a routine grounder into the stands, scoring Ludwick. Zach Cozart singled to put runners on the corners. Cincinnati rookie base-stealing specialist Billy Hamilton pinch ran for Cozart and promptly swiped second then raced home when Devin Mesoraco's sharp grounder ping ponged onto the grass in shallow left field.        
Votto took care of the rest as Cincinnati climbed out of third place in the heated NL Central race for the first time in three months.        
Ludwick finished 3 for 5 for the Reds, while Frazier hit his 17th home run.        
Jose Tabata and Neil Walker hit consecutive homers off Cincinnati starter Mat Latos in the first and Pittsburgh appeared on its way giving itself some breathing room as the franchise pursues its first playoff spot since 1992.        
The Pirates did their best to downplay the importance of the franchise's biggest series in 21 years while Reds manager Dusty Baker joked if his players didn't understand the stakes it was time for them ""to get new jobs.""        
PNC Park, typically a ghost town this time of year as the Pirates play out the string, was electric when Pittsburgh took the field. Ludwick's RBI single off Liriano in the top of the first took some of buzz out of a crowd that included Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett and Pittsburgh Penguins coach Dan Bylsma, but only for a moment.        
Tabata led off the bottom of the first with his sixth home run of the season on a shot well into the bleachers in left field and Walker took Latos' very next pitch over the wall in center to give Pittsburgh a 2-1 lead. The blast marked the fourth time in club history the Pirates started a game with consecutive home runs.        
Andrew McCutchen walked and Justin Morneau singled, earning Latos a rare first-inning visit from Baker. He worked out of the jam but the reprieve only lasted until the fourth. Marlon Byrd walked with one out, moved to third on a hit-and-run single by Alvarez and scored when Martin recorded his first non-home run RBI since Aug. 22. Mercer beat out an infield hit to plate Alvarez and the Pirates had a commanding 4-1 lead.        
Latos left after six innings, giving up four runs on eight hits with two walks and a season-low one strikeout.        
While Latos labored, Liriano cruised. Save for Frazier's solo homer leading off the fifth he had little trouble working through Cincinnati's powerful lineup. He picked up his 1,000th career strikeout when Chris Heisey whiffed in the eighth and received a standing ovation when the milestone was flashed on the scoreboard.        
The scoreboard flashed a different number an hour later as the Reds finished off a comeback that could resonate through the final week of the regular season.        
NOTES: Pirates manager Clint Hurdle was ejected in the eighth for arguing after McCutchen was hit by reliever Sam LeCure, who was given a warning by home plate umpire Mark Carlson ... The series continues on Saturday when Pittsburgh's A.J. Burnett (8-11, 3.43 ERA) faces Home Bailey (11-10, 3.40). Bailey tossed his first career no-hitter in his previous start at PNC Park last September.

A tentative settlement has been reached in a dispute over the $300 million fortune of the copper heiress Huguette Clark, a recluse who lived for two decades in a hospital room though she owned several mansions, lawyers for several parties said Friday night.        


Mrs. Clark died in May 2011, at the age of 104. She left behind a fortune inherited from her father, William Andrews Clark, a copper magnate and United States senator from Montana, and two wills executed six weeks apart in 2005.        
One of the wills left all but $5 million of her estate to her family; the other cut out her family, instead leaving her fortune to a newly created foundation for the arts and various people around her, including her nurse, her doctor, the lawyer who drafted the will and the accountant who consulted on it.        
As jury selection began in a lawsuit filed by her relatives, a tentative settlement was brokered by the New York State attorney general’s office over the last few days. Under the settlement, the family would get about $34.5 million after taxes. Mrs. Clark’s lawyer, Wallace Bock, and accountant, Irving Kamsler, would get nothing; her nurse, Hadassah Peri, would get nothing and would have to give back $5 million, according to lawyers involved in the case. Mr. Bock, Mr. Kamsler and Mrs. Peri would be able to keep gifts that Mrs. Clark had left them while she was alive — in Mrs. Peri’s case, more than $30 million worth.        
Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, the hospital where Mrs. Clark lived for the last 20 years of her life, would get the $1 million she gave it in her second will, the parties said, and her doctor, Henry Singman, would get $100,000. But the hospital and Dr. Singman could be subject to further court proceedings challenging gifts they had received outside the will, one of the parties said.        
Under the tentative settlement, Mrs. Clark’s mansion in California, Bellosguardo, would become a foundation, as envisioned in the second will, and the Corcoran Gallery of Art, where her father’s art collection fills a wing, would get $10 million, the lawyers said. Mrs. Clark’s valuable doll collection, bequeathed in the second will to Mrs. Peri, would instead go to the newly created Bellosguardo Foundation, according to one of the parties.        
Lawyers for several of the parties said it had become clear that a trial would be long and grueling and that the outcome was unpredictable. They said they had tried to broker a fair agreement that would end the dispute.        
Mrs. Clark’s family — 20 grandnieces and grandnephews and great-grandnieces and great-grandnephews descended from her father’s first marriage — contended in the lawsuit that the second will was the product of undue influence and fraud and that Ms. Clark did not have the capacity to understand what she was signing.        
After several attempts to settle the case failed, jury selection began on Thursday, focusing on whether jurors had heard of the case — many had — and whether they were willing to sit for a six- to eight-week trial. Many were not. But the selection ended abruptly, after about two hours, and settlement talks began again.        
All parties in the lawsuit would have to sign off on the proposed settlement to avoid trial, and the agreement would have to be approved by a Surrogate’s Court judge; that could happen as early as next week, one of the lawyers said. Mrs. Clark, born in 1906, was raised in Paris, in Santa Barbara, Calif., and in a mansion on Fifth Avenue; she graduated from Miss Spence’s school, now the Spence School. She was married only briefly and had no children. After her divorce and her mother’s death, Mrs. Clark lived much of her life as a recluse, seeing little of her family. In court papers, many of them said they had never even met her, and most of them had not known she had been living at Beth Israel.        
Mrs. Clark entered the hospital in 1991, at the age of almost 85 until her death at almost 105. She had a severe case of skin cancer, which disfigured her face. But after being treated with plastic surgery, hospital officials said in court papers, she refused to go back home to her grand apartment on Fifth Avenue. She lived in her hospital room with the shades drawn and doors closed. She played with dolls, from Barbies to French porcelain baby dolls and watched cartoons, one of her favorites being “The Smurfs.”

Alex Rodriguez arrived at Yankee Stadium on Friday afternoon to a throng of reporters waiting to ask him for a comment.        


“Tell me what happened,” Rodriguez said, puzzled.        
He was directed to a television monitor in the clubhouse that was broadcasting Andy Pettitte’s news conference announcing that he would retire at the end of the season. Pettitte and Manager Joe Girardi were making assurances that the weekend, festooned with farewell tributes, would not be a distraction. The sideshow, this time, would not involve Rodriguez, and Rodriguez did not seem to notice the sideshow.        
But then, of course, his presence would have to be felt this week, wouldn’t it? With all the drama, the pomp and the circumstance. After all, the final nine games could be his valediction, too.        
And, on cue, Rodriguez reinjected himself into the Yankee conversation in typically marquee fashion. His grand slam in the seventh inning lifted the Yankees past the San Francisco Giants, 5-1, lifting their faint postseason hopes.        
The grand slam was Rodriguez’s 24th, sending him past Lou Gehrig for first place on the career list.        
“It’s hard to think about things like that,” Rodriguez said. “We’re really on a sprint to the end here, and every win is huge for us.”        
The day began with the announcement of Pettitte’s retirement, which, along with the long-awaited ceremonies for Mariano Rivera on Sunday and next week, creates a tricky balancing act for the club. There are still very important games to play. The Yankees, who seem to be constantly reminding themselves not to look ahead, cannot afford to lose focus looking back.        
Of course, that vacuous middle ground is an uneasy backdrop for this final homestand, straddling the belief that there will be postseason life and the reality that it may be now or never for goodbyes.        
But if there is one Yankee who seems unencumbered by reality — or the notion of goodbye, for that matter — it would be Rodriguez. While he did not know about Pettitte, he did know that he was in a 1-for-22 skid entering the game.        
“I’ve been missing balls, hitting high, towering fly balls,” Rodriguez said. “I thought my legs were a little better today.”        
The Yankees were three and a half games behind in a berth for a wild card coming into the day, with five teams ahead of them fighting for two spots. According to MLB.com, they had a 1 percent probability of making the postseason.        
“It’s time to go,” starter C. C. Sabathia said. “We need to try to win out.”        
Sabathia did everything he could, holding the Giants to one run in seven-plus innings. But San Francisco’s starter, Tim Lincecum, was just as effective, even if he is no longer firing mid-90s fastballs as he did in his prime.        
The Giants had not visited the Bronx since 2002, and Lincecum had never before faced the Yankees. As a Washington native, he said he grew up rooting for Rodriguez when the rising star played for the Mariners.        
“At a young age, it’s kind of hard not to know about guys like that,” Lincecum said.        
“It was a little surreal.”        
Lincecum retired Rodriguez three times earlier in the game. But he got in trouble in the seventh. Eduardo Nunez led off with a single to right and stole second base, putting himself into scoring position with one out. But the Giants third baseman Pablo Sandoval made an impressive sliding stop on a grounder down the line by J. R. Murphy, forcing Nunez at third, on Lincecum’s 116th pitch.        
Five pitches later, Lincecum walked Ichiro Suzuki, loading the bases. Giants Manager Bruce Bochy brought in reliever George Kontos to face Rodriguez. On a 2-1 fastball, Rodriguez sent his home run out to right.        
“It’s a huge hit,” Girardi said. “I don’t know how many more we can afford to lose, and we’re in a very tight game with C. C. and Lincecum, a very good matchup, and we needed a big hit.”        
Said Sabathia: “It was vintage. It felt good to be able to see him do that. That was a big moment.”        
With such monumental importance on each game, the timing of the Pettitte announcement certainly complicated things. A large news media gathering attended Pettitte’s early-afternoon news conference. Some Pettitte highlights were shown on the video board during the game.        
Girardi said he did not believe the additional hoopla and the buildup for Sunday’s start would deter Pettitte’s routine or the focus of his teammates.        
“That’s not what he wanted,” Girardi said before the game. “We thought it was important for him, because Andy understands what the fans have meant to his life and his family’s life, and he wanted to say thank you. And we all thought that this was the proper way.”        
INSIDE PITCH        
Reliever Boone Logan was available to pitch Friday, according to Joe Girardi. Logan had been out since Sept. 6 with a bone spur in his left elbow, and is expected to need off-season surgery.

PHILADELPHIA — Each spring, Mets Manager Terry Collins talks with his young players about their expectations for spring training and the season ahead. He tells them: if you want to know what it takes, watch David Wright — do what he does.        


Collins hoped they were watching Friday. Wright returned to the lineup seven weeks after straining his right hamstring, with 10 games left in a lost season. He could have sat out the rest of the year, but he came back for his teammates, the fans and the organization.        
“This is what I do,” Wright said. “This is what I love to do. If I’m healthy enough to play, I’m going to play. Therefore, I’m playing. It’s about as simple as it gets.”        
His first game back went about as well as it could. Wright homered in his initial at-bat, and the Mets followed his lead, scoring the first five runs and beating the Phillies, 6-4.        
Having Wright back seemed to lift the Mets’ spirits. Collins was happy just to write his name in the lineup again. During warm-ups, Wright smiled and chatted. He put everyone at ease, said Daniel Murphy, the Mets’ only real lineup threat for weeks.        
“He shows you how to be a pro,” Murphy said.        
Wright had not faced live pitching in seven weeks, and the minor league seasons had ended before he was ready for a rehabilitation assignment. He took batting practice, fielded grounders and ran the bases at Citi Field, but there was no way to replicate the speed of a major league game.        
Before Friday’s game, at his locker, Wright seemed somewhat concerned, especially with Cole Hamels on the mound.        
“We’ve talked about it, that he hasn’t seen any live pitching,” Collins said. “But, you know, he’s David Wright, too. You’ve got to take that into consideration.”        
When Wright stepped to the plate in the first, Murphy had already singled home Eric Young. The crowd at Citizens Bank Park was mostly quiet, still settling into their seats. Hamels’s first pitch was out of the strike zone, and then Wright lifted a high fastball deep to right field for his 17th home run of the season.        
In the dugout, Collins told him, “The game’s not that easy.”        
The home run moved Wright past Mike Piazza into second place on the Mets’ career list, with 221. In the field Wright appeared to move well, and after the game he said his play would become more smooth as he regained his rhythm.        
In the third, Murphy singled in front of Wright again. But Hamels threw a cutter high and inside, and Wright’s fly ball ended in a nifty sliding catch by left fielder Domonic Brown. Two batters later, Andrew Brown drove in Murphy with a single.        
By the time Wright came up again in the fifth, the Mets’ lead had been reduced to a run, at 5-4, after Daisuke Matsuzaka allowed the first four Phillies to reach base in the fourth, highlighted by Darin Ruf’s bases-loaded double.        
The Phillies had life, and Hamels struck out Wright on four pitches.        
The score was still 5-4 in the seventh when Murphy singled again and advanced to third as Wright popped a single to right field. Josh Satin then scored Murphy on a fielder’s choice.        
As Wright rehabilitated his hamstring, he was asked why he was trying to come back at all this season. He insisted that it was the right thing — he wanted to finish the season strong and put on a show for the fans.        
Collins said he hoped Wright would play 8 of these final 10 games. He and Wright will take it day by day. The first day back, at least, was a success.        
“That’s why he’s the captain,” Collins said. “This guy leads by example.”

SAN ANTONIO — Antoine Roussel scored two goals for the Dallas Stars on Friday night in a 4-1 NHL preseason win over Florida in an NHL preseason game played at the home of the Panthers' AHL affiliate.        
It appeared that Roussel had completed a hat trick 2:37 into the third period during a power play, but his shot from the right circle was redirected into the net by Colton Sceviour.        
Roussel, who netted seven goals last season as a rookie with the Stars, scored less than five minutes into the game when he deflected in Trevor Daley's shot.        
In the second period, Roussel took a centering pass after Chris Mueller's rush and quickly bounced the puck under goalie Michael Houser. Mueller also scored with less than six minutes to go.        
Dan Ellis, subbing for Stars starter Kari Lehtonen, lost his shutout bid when Tom Gilbert scored a power-play goal midway through the third period.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Neftali Feliz walked Alcides Escobar on four pitches with the bases loaded and two outs in the eighth inning Friday night, giving the Kansas City Royals a 2-1 victory over the Texas Rangers in the opener of an important three-game series between teams in the playoff race.        


Texas dropped a half-game behind the Indians for the second AL wild-card spot with the loss. Cleveland beat the Houston Astros 2-1 in rain-shortened game. The Royals were three games behind Tampa Bay. The leading Rays played Baltimore.        
The Rangers and Royals scored matching runs in the second inning before two stingy pitching staffs started throwing up zeros.        
The Royals finally broke through when Lorenzo Cain and Mike Moustakas hit consecutive two-out singles off the Rangers' Jason Frasor (4-3) in the eighth. Pinch-hitter David Lough drew a walk on a full-count pitch to load the bases, and Rangers manager Ron Washington brought in Feliz.        
He promptly walked Escobar, a .238 hitter, on four pitches as a crowd of 30,000 roared. It was just the 19th walk that Escobar had earned in more than 600 plate appearances this season.        
Luke Hochevar (5-2) earned the win in relief of Ervin Santana, who allowed one run on five hits in 7 1-3 innings. Greg Holland worked the ninth for his 44th save.        
The Rangers jumped out to an early lead when Adrian Beltre, whose .374 average coming into the game was the best of any current player at Kauffman Stadium, roped a single to lead off the second. It was followed by a double by A.J. Pierzynski for a 1-0 lead.        
The Royals answered in the bottom half when Salvador Perez led off with a double and Justin Maxwell, getting the start in right field, hit a two-out double to tie the game.        
Kansas City kept wasting chances in the early innings, though.        
Billy Butler grounded into a double play to end the first, Moustakas grounded into another in the second. The Royals worked back-to-back walks in the fourth before Escobar flied out to center field to end yet another scoring threat.        
The most egregious mistake came in the sixth, when Maxwell walked and Escobar was hit by a pitch from Rangers starter Martin Perez. Maxwell suddenly took off for third base with Alex Gordon at the plate, and he was easily thrown out by catcher Geovany Soto to end the inning.        
None of those jams was as tight as the one Santana worked out of in the fifth. After retiring the first two batters, David Murphy doubled, Leonys Martin singled and Ian Kinsler drew a walk to load the bases. Santana recovered to strike out Elvis Andrus and leave all three aboard.        
The Rangers had another opportunity in the eighth, but Hochever got Andrus to fly out to left and Alex Rios to ground out to first to leave Kinsler standing on first base.        
NOTES: RHP Matt Garza goes to the mound for the Rangers on Saturday night. The Royals counter with RHP Jeremy Guthrie. ... Soto gave Pierzynski a night off behind the plate. Washington said it had nothing to do with a bruised finger that Pierzynski had on his glove hand.

DENVER — Jhoulys Chacin tossed six shaky innings and helped himself with his first career home run and the Colorado Rockies beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 9-4 on Friday night.        


Troy Tulowitzki, Charlie Blackmon and Corey Dickerson also went deep for the Rockies.        
Paul Goldschmidt hit his NL-leading 35th homer and drove in two runs and A.J. Pollock homered for Arizona.        
The Diamondbacks were playing a day after the Los Angeles Dodgers clinched the NL West in Phoenix and then celebrated by jumping into the Chase Field pool. Some players were upset by the move, but Goldschmidt wasn't bothered.        
""I can't speak for anyone else, but I didn't care. It's just my opinion,"" he said before Friday's game. ""I'm not saying the other guys who spoke out against it are wrong, for me they can do whatever they want. They won.""        
Outfielder Adam Eaton said some of the players weren't happy about the Dodgers celebration but pointed out they could have prevented it.        
""We weren't all thrilled with it. We had a chance to win, we had a chance to send them on their way and we didn't do that so it's our own fault for letting it happen,"" he said.        
The Rockies couldn't do much against starter Randall Delgado. The right-hander allowed three hits and two walks before being lifted for a pinch-hitter in the sixth.        
His only mistake was Chacin's two-run homer in the third that tied the game 2-all.        
The score stayed that way until Blackmon greeted reliever Tony Sipp (3-2) with his fifth home run to lead off the sixth. Josh Rutledge singled and Dickerson hit a ball off the facing of the second deck to make it 5-2. It was Dickerson's fourth home run.        
J.J. Putz relieved Sipp and gave up a two-out RBI single to Charlie Culberson to make it 6-2.        
Goldschmidt homered off Mitchell Boggs in the seventh to make it 6-3.        
Tulowitzki answered with his 24th of the year, a two-run shot to center to give Colorado an 8-3 lead.        
Arizona proved it was over the pool party right away. Eaton led off the game with a triple and scored on Pollock's eighth home run to make it 2-0.        
Chacin (14-9) worked out of trouble all game in part because of five walks. He only allowed two runs and was able to pitch his way out of jams to earn his first win in three weeks.        
He loaded the bases in the sixth with two walks but got pinch-hitter Willie Bloomquist to line out to end the inning.        
NOTES: The last Colorado pitcher to homer was Alex White on Sept. 16, 2012, at San Diego. ... Rockies OF Michael Cuddyer (left wrist, forearm) was not in the lineup and unavailable to hit Friday. ... Colorado LHP Jorge De La Rosa (left thumb) will not make his scheduled start Saturday. ... Diamondbacks RHP Trevor Cahill (7-10) will face Colorado RHP Collin McHugh (0-2) on Saturday night.

WASHINGTON — A little more than 24 hours after an IT contractor gunned down a dozen workers at the Washington Navy Yard, the CEO of the company he worked for sent an email to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus saying he has the experience to help the military improve its security.         
The email from The Experts chief Thomas Hoshko, which included descriptions of his background and expertise, stunned some Navy leaders still reeling from the shooting rampage Monday that left 13 people dead, including the gunman, former Navy reservist Aaron Alexis.        
And it fueled concern over what defense officials believe may have been failures by the company to alert the military about Alexis' apparent mental health problems.        
In the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press, Hoshko said he was ""dramatically"" affected by the incident and ""my heart and prayers go out to the families and friends of those innocent victims."" But the email quickly moves on, as Hoshko lays out his work experience and offers his services, saying he is ""confident that I can provide valuable input and solutions to the process that will provide better security for the military, contractors and civilians.""        
Navy officials confirmed that email was sent to Mabus, but they declined to characterize its contents.        
Florida-based The Experts declined to comment.        
Revelation of the email comes as the Navy and the Defense Department launch a series of short- and long-term reviews into Alexis' Navy service history, the Pentagon's security clearance procedures, overall safety at defense installations around the world and the responsibilities that contractors have in reviewing their workers and notifying the military about potential problems.        
One of the first reviews ordered by Mabus into the nearly four years of Alexis' troubled Navy career, is almost complete, according to the Navy. Mabus had asked for a review of Alexis' service record to determine if his behavioral problems while in the Navy should have affected his ability to keep his security clearance.        
A secret security clearance is good for 10 years. It carries over, even if a worker leaves the military and joins a private company, as long as the gap between the two jobs is not more than two years. As a result, Alexis' clearance level was simply verified when he went to work for The Experts, but no additional research or checks were done.        
Officials have acknowledged that a lot of red flags may have been missed in the months and years before Alexis brought a sawed-off shotgun into Building 197 at the Navy Yard and began shooting workers in a drawn-out assault that ended when he was killed in a gunbattle with police. Alexis had maintained his secret level security clearance and passed at least two background checks despite a string of minor arrests, mental health issues and some recent bouts of suspicious conduct that raised worries even within the company.

DENVER — Ryan O'Reilly scored two goals, including a short-handed tally 45 seconds into overtime, and the Avalanche earned a 4-3 NHL preseason victory over the Los Angeles Kings on Friday night for Patrick Roy's first win as Colorado's coach.        
The Avalanche rallied after Dwight King's power-play goal at 38 seconds of the third period made it 3-1.        
Steve Downie lifted the puck over sprawled goalie Martin Jones for a power-play goal at 3:20. O'Reilly made it 3-3 at 9:37 when he put in his rebound after taking a pass from Matt Duchene, who had three assists.        
In overtime, O'Reilly spun around a defender near the net before knocking in a backhander for the winner.

SEOUL — North Korea on Saturday postponed an emotionally charged humanitarian program that would have allowed hundreds of family members on both sides of the divided Korean Peninsula to meet for the first time since the Korean War six decades ago.        


North and South Korea had agreed last month to allow up to 100 people from each side to meet their relatives at the Diamond Mountain resort in southeastern North Korea starting on Wednesday.        
But on Saturday, the North abruptly announced that it was delaying the reunions, saying that inter-Korean relations were being plunged into crisis because of a “reckless and vicious confrontational racket” of the conservative government in Seoul.        
A statement from the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, Pyongyang’s agency in charge of relations with the South, accused Seoul of provoking the North by telling its people that Pyongyang had been forced to make its recent conciliatory gestures, including the agreement on family reunions, because of the strong principled stances of President Park Geun-hye of the South.        
It also protested the recent arrest of a progressive opposition lawmaker on charges of treason. The legislator, Lee Seok-ki, was charged with urging 130 followers to stage an armed rebellion to help North Korea overthrow the South in the event of war on the peninsula. Mr. Lee has said he and his followers were singled out in the government’s plot to silence critics of Ms. Park.        
On Saturday, North Korea called the Lee case part of the South Korean government’s “witch hunt” to crack down on people championing reconciliation and cooperation with the North.        
The postponement of family reunions dampened hopes for improved inter-Korean ties after recent moves by both Koreas to ease tensions created by the North’s nuclear test in February and threats of war last spring. Last week, the two sides resumed operations at a jointly operated factory park that was shut down in April.        
The two Koreas have not held family reunions since 2010. Their revival had been expected to further accelerate the two governments’ move toward a thaw after months of tension. It had also been particularly welcome news for 73,000 South Koreans — half more than 80 years old — who are on a waiting list to meet with relatives in the North.        
On Monday, North and South Korea had exchanged the lists of the names of 96 South Koreans and 100 North Koreans who would be allowed to see their relatives next week.        
Millions of Koreans were divided by the Korean War of 1950-53, which ended in a stalemate and a cease-fire. With no exchanges of letters, e-mails or telephone calls allowed across the border, family reunions remain a highly emotional issue.        
About 129,000 people from South Korea alone originally applied for the family reunion program. But only 22,000 people in total, from both Koreas, were allowed to meet during 18 rounds of government-arranged reunions from 1985 to 2010, when the program was suspended as inter-Korean relations soured. On average, 2,000 South Koreans on the waiting list die each year.        
South Korean officials have also suspected the North of using the humanitarian program for political leverage, while the North has often accused the better-off South of using humanitarian aid to push its political demands in negotiations.        
The North’s postponement of family reunions was an “anti-humanitarian” behavior that “crushed the longing and hopes” of aging Koreans waiting to meet their relatives before they die, Kim Eui-do, a South Korean government spokesman, said in a statement.

Readers discuss the pros and cons of telecommuting.         
         
To the Editor: 
“Is Suburban Sprawl on Its Way Back?” (Sunday Review, Sept. 15) pointed out that one reason suburban sprawl may not resume its outward creep is that “moderate-income families have seen their transportation costs balloon to more than a quarter of their income.”        
I remember the many years in which I had a two-and-a-half-hour round-trip commute to my office job in northern New Jersey. It was awful, it cost hundreds of dollars a month and it was totally unnecessary. Today, I work at home in western Massachusetts, making a good living as a freelance writer. I regularly interview sources, confer with editors and do my work via phone and Internet. I travel on business no more than twice a year.        
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York was quoted in a recent magazine interview saying: “Being on a conference call isn’t the same as standing at the water cooler. It just isn’t. And I think you gotta go to work. And I think people should be next to each other to the extent possible.”        
To which I say, where’s the evidence that physical proximity to one another helps people work better or more creatively? And where’s the evidence that professionals are any less productive when they work at home?        
It’s time for more employers to take advantage of modern technology and allow telecommuting. Then people won’t have to choose between having a nice house in the suburbs with a long commute and living in an overpriced condo near or in a city. They will live better, spend more time with their children and be more productive when they don’t have a costly, stressful commute every day. And they can work just as closely with their colleagues as they can when they’re in the same office.

For 12 years, people in our company worked from home offices. For the last year and a half, most of us have been working out of an office in Manhattan. This experience has convinced me that people who work collaboratively work more creatively, more efficiently and more productively when in close proximity. Some of our employees still work from home, and I have noticed that they’re often about half a step out of sync with the rest of us because they’re simply not in the flow of day-to-day operations.        
Yes, you can get a great deal done by Internet and conference calls, but not everything that transpires in a company is documented in an e-mail or a phone call. There’s all that in-between stuff, the stuff that happens between the idea and the delivery.        
Moreover, it’s difficult for an employer to ascertain the productivity of a worker who is not in the office. An employee working from home can run errands, go to the gym or otherwise not do his or her work, without the employer knowing it. A number of our remote employees have proved this to me over the years.        
And finally, there’s the human factor. Inflection, mood and meaning are all much more apparent in person than over the phone, and certainly more than in an e-mail. When it’s really important, people will inevitably say, “We should meet in person to discuss this.” As far as I’m concerned, business is really important every day, so we should meet in person every day to conduct it.

Like Mr. Terry, I have been working from home for some time now, thoroughly enjoying my 15-second commute to my basement office. While there are times that I miss the chance to bounce ideas around with colleagues at the “water cooler,” I do not miss the corporate politics and petty personal disputes that often interfered with productivity.        
Mr. Terry notes how modern technology enables telecommuting. I think modern technology also hinders the collaborative productivity assumed to be the advantage of being present in the workplace. In my visits to a wide range of corporate offices, I am struck by how “standing by the water cooler” has morphed into isolated intimacy with smartphones and laptops. While physically present on site, more often than not employees are mentally present elsewhere — staring at a device that seduces them with e-mails and text messages.

Bonita Spence, an investigator for public defenders whose second job as a basketball referee took her to the sport’s highest level, working at N.C.A.A. tournament games, Women’s National Basketball Association games and the first men’s professional game to be officiated entirely by women, died on Sept. 15 in West Orange, N.J. She was 52.        


The cause was suicide, said Alma Dobson, her aunt.        
Well known in the world of basketball, Ms. Spence officiated at college games for nearly three decades and at N.C.A.A. Division I championship games since 2000.        
In 1992, she broke new ground when she and Sandhi Ortiz-Del Valle became the first all-female crew to officiate at a men’s professional basketball game, in the United States Basketball League.        
“It was just another game for us,” Ms. Spence said at the time. “I thought the players had a harder time getting adjusted to two women officials.”        
The Web site College Spun said Ms. Spence was “one of the few officials willing to joke with students in the crowd,” and noted that at the annual Paradise Jam basketball tournament in the Virgin Islands, she even participated in a halftime dance competition.        
“She always put a smile on my face, no matter what, whether we won or lost,” said Way Veney, a basketball assistant at Temple University.        
Ms. Spence would be greeted at University of Connecticut games, which she frequently officiated, with a cheer from the student section: “Boooooniiiiiitaaaaa!”        
She worked as an investigator in the public defender’s office in Newark. Having run youth basketball clinics around the city, she was fearless about going to rough neighborhoods late at night, said Michael Marucci, the deputy public defender for the Essex region.        
Bonita Spence was born on Aug. 5, 1961, in Atlantic City, and was raised by her aunt, Ms. Dobson. At 5 feet 4 inches, she played point guard in college for Monmouth and set the program record for assists in the 1982 season. “When you assist, you don’t have to be big and tall,” Ms. Dobson said.        
Besides her aunt, Ms. Spence is survived by a daughter, Leslie Celeste Sekou; her father, Archie Spence Sr.; a stepsister, Cathy Rabb; and a grandmother, Anna Mae DeShields.        
Asked how she was able to officiate at so many basketball games and also work for the public defender’s office, Mr. Marucci responded, “She did a lot of night flights.”

8 P.M. (HBO) HITCHCOCK (2012) Anthony Hopkins, buried in a fat suit and facial prosthetics, summons the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock during the making of “Psycho” in this biopic, directed by Sacha Gervasi and based on a book by Stephen Rebello. But Hitchcock isn’t merely taken with the inspiration behind his perverse shocker: Robert Bloch’s 1959 novel about the crimes of Ed Gein, a serial killer in Wisconsin who adorned his home with human body parts and walked around in the skin of his female victims. Hitchcock becomes possessed, enduring sleepless nights and, at the same time, marital troubles with his wife and adviser, Alma (Helen Mirren, above with Mr. Hopkins), who is dramatically unhappy about his fixation on blondes — in this case, Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson). “The real Hitchcock’s great flaw, apparently, was that he was at once a genius and a private man, a combination that has allowed some writers and filmmakers to have their insultingly imaginative way with him,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. And while “The Girl,” on HBO, “painted him as a pathetic sexual predator,” this film “takes a lighter, more strenuously comic if patronizing approach to the director,” she said. “It’s fluff. But while its dim fantasies about Hitchcock and the association of genius with psychosis can be written off as silly, they also smack of spiteful jealousy.”

HONG KONG — The strongest typhoon to hit Asia this year caused landslides in the Philippines and flooding in Taiwan on Saturday as it appeared headed toward the densely populated Pearl River Delta area of China, with the financial center of Hong Kong preparing for possible business shutdowns at the start of the workweek.        


China’s National Meteorological Center issued a red alert — the highest-level warning — with the storm, called Super Typhoon Usagi, on a path to hit Guangdong Province, the industrial powerhouse at the heart of the Pearl River Delta. Coastal Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces were also covered by the alert.        
The storm, with a width of nearly 700 miles and carrying sustained winds of 139 miles per hour, battered the northern Philippine island of Luzon on one side while striking Taiwan on the other, moving between the two on a path straight toward Hong Kong at the foot of the delta. It was expected to make landfall in the financial hub on Sunday night, although forecasters said it could veer from that course.        
More than 2,000 people were evacuated from low-lying and mountainous areas of Taiwan out of fear of flooding and landslides, and powerful storm surges drenched fishing boats along the coasts of the island. In the Philippines, the typhoon caused power failures and evacuations, with landslides in the north of the country, but no fatalities were immediately reported.        
The Hong Kong Observatory said the storm would pose a “severe threat to Hong Kong.”        
“Engineers, architects and contractors should make sure that scaffoldings, hoardings, windowpanes and other temporary structures are secured,” the observatory said in a statement. “The public should remain vigilant, and take precautions against strong winds and flooding as early as possible.”        
In anticipation of the typhoon, Cathay Pacific Airways and the affiliated Dragonair canceled operations at its Hong Kong hub starting at 6 p.m. Sunday and said flight disruptions would probably continue into Monday.        
“The airline is monitoring the situation closely and will issue further advice on the resumption of flight services,” Cathay said in a statement. “It is anticipated that disruptions will continue on 23 September due to the impact of adverse weather and operational constraints.”        
As the storm barreled toward mainland China, preparations were already under way, with more than 20,000 fishing boats moved to secure locations and 4,000 people evacuated from coastal areas of Fujian Province, state news media reported.

NAIROBI, Kenya — Masked gunmen stormed into a fancy, crowded mall in Nairobi on Saturday and shot dead at least 39 people and wounded more than 150 in one of the most chilling terrorist attacks in East Africa since Al Qaeda blew up two American embassies in 1998.        


Parents hurled their bodies over their children, people jumped into ventilation shafts to save themselves, and shoppers huddled behind the plastic mannequins of designer clothing stores as two squads of gunmen believed to be linked to a Somali terrorist group moved through the mall, shooting shoppers in the head. Hours later, the mall’s gleaming floors were smeared with blood as police officers dashed through the corpse-strewn corridors, trying to find the assailants.        
A standoff with the attackers, who were reported to be heavily armed and holding an unknown number of hostages, continued as the sun rose on Sunday.        
The mall, called Westgate, is a symbol of Kenya’s rising prosperity, an impressive five-story building where Kenyans can buy expensive cups of frozen yogurt and plates of sushi. On Saturdays, it is especially crowded, and American officials have long warned that Nairobi’s malls were ripe targets for terrorists, especially Westgate, because a cafe on the ground floor, right off the street, is owned by Israelis.        
Fred Ngoga Gateretse, an official with the African Union, was having coffee at that cafe around noon when he heard two deafening blasts. He cowered on the floor and watched eight gunmen with scarves twisted over their faces firing at shoppers and then up at Kenyan police officers who were shooting down from a balcony as panicked shoppers dashed for cover. “Believe me, these guys were good shooters,” Mr. Gateretse said. “You could tell they were trained.”        
Several witnesses said the attackers had shouted for Muslims to run away while they picked off other shoppers, executing them one by one. The mall, one of Nairobi’s most luxurious, with glass elevators and some of the most expensive shops in town, is also popular with expatriates. It has served as the place for a power lunch, to catch a movie, to bring children for ice cream.        
Four Americans were believed to have been injured in the attack, American officials said, and none were reported killed. Secretary of State John Kerry, who called the attack “a heartbreaking reminder that there exists unspeakable evil in our world,” said the wife of a local employee of the American government was among the dead. Two Canadians, one of them a diplomat based in Nairobi, and two French citizens were killed, their governments said.        
A confidential United Nations security report on Saturday described the attack as “a complex, two-pronged assault” with two squads of gunmen dashing into the mall from different floors at the same time and opening fire.        
The Shabab, an Islamist militant group based in Somalia, took responsibility for the attack, saying it was revenge for Kenya’s military operations in Somalia, which began nearly two years ago. “Kenya will not get peace unless they pull their military out of Somalia,” said Ali Mohamoud Rage, the Shabab’s spokesman, in a radio address. The Shabab also sent out a barrage of buoyant Twitter messages, bragging about the prowess of their fighters before Twitter abruptly suspended the account late Saturday. Later, a new one was set up.        
Kenya’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, called the terrorists cowards and said Kenya would remain “as brave and invincible as the lions on our coat of arms.” He also sounded a somber note, pleading with Kenyans to give blood , and said he had lost “very close family members in this attack,” though he did not specify further.        
In addition to the 39 people killed, who included women and children, Mr. Kenyatta said, more than 150 were wounded. Government officials said the wounded ranged in age from 2 to 78.        
By Saturday night, Kenyan commandos had cornered several of the assailants on the third floor of the mall, witnesses said. Western officials said they expected that the assailants would fight to the death, though the Kenyan news media reported that one wounded gunman had been captured and died in a hospital. Several witnesses also said one of the assailants was a woman.        
Throughout the day, as the police cleared sections of the mall, terrified shoppers emerged with their hands up and collapsed in each other’s arms.        
Early Sunday, the government said that the mall’s upper levels had been secured and the gunmen contained in one place, but that hostages remained in several locations.        
Witnesses described attackers using AK-47 and G-3 assault rifles and throwing grenades.        
Vivian Atieno, 26, who works on the first floor of the mall, described “intense shooting,” starting around 11 a.m., before she escaped through a fire exit.

FAIRHOPE, Ala. — Judging from the questions submitted by the audience, everyone attending the Eastern Shore Republican Women candidates’ forum shared some basic assumptions.        


How does one get rid of Obamacare? How badly does a broken immigration policy hurt the district? What is the best way to roll back federal spending and intrusion into state issues? As for President Obama, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria received more kind words.        
But while the Republicans running to represent Alabama’s First Congressional District are in agreement on the core message, their styles vary, in some ways jarringly. And the outcome of Tuesday’s primary, though likely to be a function of turnout here, may provide some hints on how much further the Republican shift to the right might go.        
There was a time when this primary would be automatic. The district, which surrounds Mobile Bay, was one of several in Alabama to vote Republican in 1964 when Barry Goldwater ran for president and Alabama was still a solidly Democratic state. For the nearly five decades since, it was represented by just three Republican congressmen, the first two publicly designating their successors and all three inclined to effective deal-making rather than fiery rhetoric.        
“The thing that makes a congressman effective in the South is constituent services,” said Sonny Callahan, who represented the district in Congress from 1985 to 2003.        
Such a candidate in the past may have been Bradley Byrne, 58, a former state senator and the current front-runner, or perhaps Chad A. Fincher, 39, a two-term state legislator from Mobile’s conservative western suburbs. But with no heir apparent for the first time in 50 years, the full spectrum of conservatism is on display: from Mr. Byrne, who speaks sunnily of the country’s ability to overcome any of its current challenges, to Dean Young, a real estate developer and Tea Party favorite who describes the stakes of the election in far less optimistic terms.        
“We are witnessing the end of a Western Christian empire,” Mr. Young, 49, said at the forum.        
The Republican field quickly populated after Representative Jo Bonner announced in May that he was stepping down for a position with the University of Alabama system (the state Democratic Party missed the filing deadline, though the two Democratic candidates were allowed to run anyway).        
In addition to Mr. Byrne, Mr. Young and Mr. Fincher, the field includes Wells Griffith, 31, a hometown boy made good, who recently worked at the Republican National Committee and whose supporters see him as a direct line to Representative Paul D. Ryan and the other young prominent figures of the right; and Quin Hillyer, 49, a conservative journalist whose detailed policy analyses and list of endorsements testify to decades in the premier circles of the conservative movement.        
Everyone expects a runoff, and the runoff could include any of these. The only candidate assumed to be a lock is Mr. Byrne, the best financed and most widely known.        
Mr. Byrne, whose political career and support from the business community have marked him as the establishment candidate, is known statewide for a bruising race for governor in 2010. That Republican primary became a pitched battle between Mr. Byrne, who had the broad backing of Republican leaders, and Tim James, a staunch conservative and son of a former governor. Their fighting, and a nasty scrap Mr. Byrne got into with the teachers’ union, left voters cold and opened the way for another Republican, Robert J. Bentley, a mild-mannered dermatologist who now sits in the governor’s mansion.        
This recent lesson about the wisdom of letting others do the attacking perhaps explains how well-mannered this primary has been so far.        
But negativity lingers from the ad wars in 2010, including perceptions that Mr. Byrne, a Democrat until 1997, is insufficiently conservative. He, like the others, supports getting rid of the president’s health care law and has even proposed abolishing the Internal Revenue Service. But he talks repeatedly of spending on infrastructure and working with Congressional Democrats where possible. And, citing a huge investment by the aircraft maker Airbus that may transform Mobile, Mr. Byrne is surprisingly upbeat for a conservative running in these times.        
“I think people are concerned,” he said in an interview at a campaign gathering for young professionals, many of them young men with good haircuts and pressed khakis. “But people don’t want to be angry. They want to be hopeful.”        
This may be an accurate read of the district. But in what is expected to be an election with very low turnout, it remains to be seen whether it is a good read of those at the polls. If not, the beneficiary may be Mr. Young.        
Mr. Young, who made a serious run at Mr. Bonner in 2012 and has financed much of his own campaign this year, says he would vote against raising the debt ceiling, sees those who would compromise in Congress as “spineless” and boasts of support from Chief Justice Roy Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court, a hero among the hard-right evangelicals who form Mr. Young’s base.        
Supporters of the other candidates speak with a respectful and perhaps wary bewilderment about this base. Its electoral behavior often eludes pollsters and competitors, as Chief Justice Moore’s recent career illustrates.        
Famed for installing a Ten Commandments monument in the state judicial building in 2003, Chief Justice Moore ran for governor in 2010 and, to the surprise of many, received less than a fifth of the votes in the primary. Two years later he ran for chief justice and, to the surprise of many, won the primary without a runoff.        
“If we get a 10 percent turnout, who knows what is going to happen,” said Lou Campomenosi, a political science professor at Tulane University who is involved in Alabama’s Tea Party movement. “That’s why I think Dean becomes the real wild card candidate, because he’s got this really fervent group behind him.”        
An hour northeast of Mobile, Mr. Fincher was greeting voters at a fair in Atmore. In a condensed campaign, Mr. Fincher’s name recognition is a considerable advantage, and many believe that he is likely to meet Mr. Byrne in a runoff.        
At the fair, Mr. Fincher talked of concerns about an out-of-control federal government and a loss of Christian values, a message that resonated with people sitting nearby and picking at barbecued ribs.        
But concern just might not be a strong enough word.        
“I think Barack Obama is the worst thing that’s ever happened to this country,” said Stoney Daw, 72, a former federal law enforcement officer and now a small town police chief. “I don’t know if we can survive three more years.”

COLUMBUS, Ohio — If Marian Gaborik feels the pressure of carrying a franchise’s hopes, he does not show it.        


As he embarks on his first full season with the Columbus Blue Jackets, there is no question that Gaborik is the linchpin of the team’s offense. Coming off the weakest of his dozen seasons in the N.H.L., he has big expectations to meet.        
“That’s why I’m here,” Gaborik, a three-time All-Star, said of the weight of being the club’s No. 1 offensive threat. “At the same time, I want to provide anything that it takes to win games, not just scoring. I want to be an all-around player and help the team in any way.”        
He has scored at least 30 goals in a season seven times, surpassing 40 three times. Last season, slowed by a torn abdominal muscle, he had only 12 goals in 47 games. He was acquired from the Rangers at the trade deadline for forwards Derick Brassard and Derek Dorsett and defenseman John Moore.        
Gaborik played well down the stretch as the Blue Jackets went 19-5-5 and missed the playoffs on a tiebreaker.        
“People get caught up in a certain year’s statistics; just look over the guy’s whole career,” Blue Jackets forward R. J. Umberger said. “I mean, he scores goals — he’s done it since he started playing hockey. Sometimes, guys go through ups and downs. He knows how to score and he’ll score a ton for us.”        
The prevailing opinion is that Gaborik, 31, has been too good for too long not to have a great season.        
“He plays that game where you might not notice him and then all of a sudden — boom — he takes off, and it’s in the back of the net,” forward Nick Foligno said. “That’s the kind of elite player that he is. He’s so dynamic and plays the game at such a high level that even if you try to contain him, he’s so hard to hold.”        
The Blue Jackets are built on hard work and the brick wall in net provided by goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky, last season’s Vezina Trophy winner. They have a cadre of double-figure goal-scorers in Brandon Dubinsky, Artem Anisimov, Mark Letestu, Umberger, Foligno and the off-season free-agent signing Nathan Horton.        
They are also counting on a group of young wings — Cam Atkinson, Ryan Johansen and Matt Calvert — to provide an uptick on offense.        
Still, Gaborik is probably the only player on the roster who would get the attention of an opposing defense.        
And the Blue Jackets’ youngsters seem awed by him.        
“He’s an elite talent,” Calvert said. “The number of goals he’s put up in the league already is amazing. To have a guy like that, to have that offensive ability, when we do need that big goal in the last minute, he gets the puck on his tape after we find him and he’s going to put it in the back of the net. That’s always reassuring.”        
Gaborik almost began his career in Columbus. There was a coin flip before the 2000 draft to find out which of the two expansion franchises, the Blue Jackets or the Minnesota Wild, would pick No. 3 and which would go next.        
The Blue Jackets, with a history of bad trades, bad teams, bad players and bad luck, lost. Gaborik went to the Wild, and the Blue Jackets took defenseman Rostislav Klesla, a serviceable journeyman on the blue line, now with Phoenix.        
Gaborik developed into one of the most feared snipers in the league. He has 336 goals and 338 assists in 769 games. When the Rangers made him available at the trade deadline, General Manager Jarmo Kekalainen and the director of hockey operations, John Davidson, jumped at the chance.        
“Having a player like Gaborik changes us,” Davidson said.        
Always one of the fastest skaters in the league with one of the quickest shots, Gaborik appears to be as quick as ever, healthy and energized by his new surroundings.        
He knows the offensive burden he carries.        
“Obviously, scoring is going to be very important,” he said, “but you can’t go out there thinking, I have to score, I have to score. You just have to focus on other parts of the game as well. The goals will come when you work hard and do your job.”        
Coach Todd Richards said he had liked what he had seen of Gaborik in training camp.        
“I sense that he’s focused, he’s ready to work,” Richards said. “And he’s ready to have a good season.”        
This is the final year of Gaborik’s contract. The Blue Jackets say they want to negotiate with him once the season begins. Left unsaid is that they want to see if Gaborik, an occasionally laconic player, is motivated to have a big season.        
“It’s a big year for us, and for myself as well,” Gaborik said. “I’m not thinking about contracts right now. I’ll go out, have fun, enjoy myself, play hard, and things will work out.”

Marvin Rainwater, a classically trained pianist who improbably turned to country music after an accident in a garage, then wrote and recorded the hit songs “Gonna Find Me a Bluebird” and “Whole Lotta Woman,” died on Tuesday in Minneapolis. He was 88.        


The cause was heart failure, his wife, Sheree, said.        
Mr. Rainwater’s piano playing was curtailed after he lost part of his right thumb in an accident while working in a garage as a teenager. He turned to the guitar, and to singing country music in his twangy baritone, while serving in the Navy during World War II.        
“When I went in the Navy, I was so lonesome for my music,” Mr. Rainwater said in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio in 1998. “Then I started writing songs, and naturally it fell back to my roots as a boy in Oklahoma, and they turned out to be hillbilly songs.”        
Draped in a buckskin jacket and beaded headband, he was often billed as Chief Marvin Rainwater — though he did not have American Indian heritage, his daughter Judie Rainwater said — and became a regular on country music television shows in the 1950s. He also appeared on “The Ed Sullivan Show” and “American Bandstand.”        
He began recording for MGM Records in 1955. “Gonna Find Me a Bluebird,” released two years later, reached No. 18 on the Billboard pop chart. “Whole Lotta Woman,” a rockabilly number, reached No. 1 in Britain in 1958 and was sung by Lynn Redgrave in the 1966 film “Georgy Girl.” Among his other records were “The Majesty of Love,” a duet with Connie Francis released in 1957.        
Marvin Karlton Rainwater was born in Wichita, Kan., on July 2, 1925. His family moved frequently, and, he recalled, “Mama took in washing so I could have a piano and take classical lessons.”        
He parted ways with MGM in the early 1960s and founded his own label, Brave Records. He continued releasing music until the early 1980s and toured until early 2011.        
Mr. Rainwater’s first two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, the former Sheree Kay Christensen, and his daughter Judie, from his first marriage, he is survived by a son, Jim, also from his first marriage; two daughters, Barbie and Laura Rainwater, and a son, Wade, from his second marriage; a sister, Patsy Rainwater; a brother, Bob; 11 grandchildren; 11 great-grandchildren; and five great-great-grandchildren.

Mariano Rivera is a rare Yankees icon. As he approaches retirement, his career and character will be celebrated Sunday at the Stadium with fans cheering and bands playing. But in the often cruel culture of baseball, in the past, many of the most famous Yankees departed unhappily, if not sadly.        


Beginning with the most famous Yankee of all, Babe Ruth.        
At his best, the Babe was the Yankees. He put the words home run into baseball’s vocabulary, notably a record 60 homers in 1927. When asked if his salary ($80,000) should be more than President Herbert Hoover’s ($75,000), he said: “Why not? I had a better year than he did.” In his 15 seasons, his Yankees teams won seven American League pennants and four World Series.        
As the Babe’s career wound down, he wanted to be the Yankees’ manager, but the owner, Jacob Ruppert, insisted on retaining Joe McCarthy. When the Boston Braves’ owner, Judge Emil Fuchs, offered to make the Babe a vice president and assistant manager with a $25,000 salary and a share of the profits to mostly pinch-hit in the 1935 season, the Yankees could not agree fast enough.        
The only thanks the Babe got from the Yankees was thanks for the memories. And not long after hitting three home runs for the Braves in a game at Pittsburgh, he decided to retire, saying Fuchs had double-crossed him.        
The Yankees honored him in 1947, when he returned to the Stadium for Babe Ruth Day. In 1948, on the 25th anniversary of the House That Ruth Built, he was there when his No. 3 uniform was retired. Two months later, he died.        
“The termites got me,” he told a teammate. Cancer. The Yankees mourned. His body lay for viewing at the entrance to Yankee Stadium for two days before his funeral Mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral.        
But when the Babe departed to the Braves, the Yankees’ front office was glad to see him go.

For Lou Gehrig, the end was tragic theater. Gehrig, the first baseman known as the Iron Horse, played 2,130 consecutive games. With a career .340 average, he hit 493 home runs, including 23 grand slams. He drove in 100 runs or more in 13 seasons. But on May 2, 1939, in Detroit, he benched himself. He was batting .143 with four singles in 28 at-bats. He never played again. Seven weeks later, he learned he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, soon known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.        
On July 4, 1939, about 62,000 fans attending Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at the Stadium heard him say, “Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.”        
He concluded, “So I close in saying that I might have been given a bad break, but I’ve got an awful lot to live for.”        
Early in 1940, the Yankees announced that his No. 4 uniform was retired; Gehrig was the only Yankee to wear that number. He died June 2, 1941, at his home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. He was 37.        
•        
Joe DiMaggio had a hollow last hurrah. His two-run homer in Game 4 of the 1951 World Series at the Polo Grounds helped propel the Yankees to a six-game victory over the Giants after his so-so season: .263 average, 12 homers, 71 runs batted in. Offered another $100,000 contract, he retired, saying: “I can’t play anymore. It’s not the money, it’s me. I don’t want to play baseball like this.” Those words confirmed a Brooklyn Dodgers scouting report in Life magazine.        
Against right-handed pitching, the report said: “His reflexes are very slow and he can’t pull a good fastball at all. Throw him nothing but good fastballs and fast curveballs. Will pull a left-handed pitcher a little more, pitch him the same. Don’t slow up on him. He will go for a bad pitch once in a while with two strikes. Speed: he can’t run and he won’t bunt. Fielding: he can’t stop quickly and throw hard. You can take the extra base on him if he’s in motion away from the line of throw.”        
He didn’t need to read that scouting report to know he was no longer the Joe DiMaggio who hit safely in 56 consecutive games in 1941. But until his death in 1999, he often returned to the Stadium, where he was introduced as “the greatest living player.”

When Dr. John H. Kennell was a hospital pediatrician in the 1950s, newborns were typically whisked away within minutes of delivery, washed, weighed, blood-tested and plunked into bassinets under the nursery’s fluorescent lights. Their mothers would not be permitted to hold them for 12 hours, sometimes longer.        


At University Hospital in Cleveland, where Dr. Kennell was the staff neonatologist, nurses bottle-fed infants every four hours. Mothers could visit, but not for very long.        
Dr. Kennell, who died on Aug. 27 at 91, liked to say that it was the full-throated complaints about this state of affairs by his patients that led him to undertake a research project in the 1960s that helped change the world on which most newborns now open their eyes.        
His findings, published in “Maternal-Infant Bonding,” a 1976 book written with Dr. Marshall H. Klaus, a fellow professor of pediatric medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, were considered a prime catalyst for changes in hospital procedures that gave new mothers more private time with their infants, let fathers into the delivery room and allowed young children to visit new siblings in the hospital.        
The book’s central claim was that infants and their mothers were hormonally primed in the first hours after birth to form crucial bonds, but that under hospital rules then commonly observed, that process was not allowed to happen.        
“Babies were ready to eat right away after being born, but they didn’t get to their mothers for 12 hours,” Dr. Kennell said. “No one was paying attention to what the baby wanted.”        
The doctors’ ideas were well received by developmental psychologists who ascribed to attachment theory, which links the relations newborns have with their first caregivers to their ability to have healthy relationships in adulthood. Relatively quickly, “bonding” became widely adopted as part of maternity ward routines.        
But “Maternal-Infant Bonding” came under severe criticism. Fellow researchers said its conclusions were based on too small a case sample and put too much stock in the mother-child interactions in the first hours. Adoptive parents complained that the theory left them out of the picture. Some feminists saw it as just another way to place child-rearing responsibilities solely on women and to blame the mother if a child grew up troubled.        
Dr. Kennell and Dr. Klaus acknowledged mistakes in their findings and published a revised version of their book in 1982, “Parent-Infant Bonding.” Though it stuck to the original premise, the new edition was less specific about a bonding timetable. The book has been updated several times since. In an introduction to the 1996 edition, the noted pediatrician-author Dr. T. Berry Brazelton defended the authors.        
“Despite criticism by some that ‘proof’ of a sensitive period for bonding between parent and baby has not been shown, the authors have continued to fight for a more humane atmosphere in hospitals at the time of delivery,” Dr. Brazelton wrote, “including time for early attachment behavior between a new parent and baby. We now realize how important it is to create this atmosphere.”        
The sea change in hospital childbirth practices drew on many social currents of the 1960s and ’70s, including the natural childbirth movement, the women’s movement and an anti-authoritarian climate, said J. Kevin Nugent, the director of the Brazelton Institute, a child and family research center founded by Dr. Brazelton at Boston Children’s Hospital.        
“Maternal-Infant Bonding,” he said, struck a chord with a broad cross section of women, many of them nurses and hospital administrators who were also mothers and were receptive to the changes it proposed.        
“Hospital procedures were geared to the efficient running of hospitals rather than to the needs of mothers and babies,” Dr. Nugent added. “John helped change that.”        
John Hawks Kennell was born on Jan. 9, 1922, in Reading, Pa., to Doris Hawks and Carlyle Kennell and grew up in Buffalo. His mother was a high school English teacher, and his father an insurance salesman.        
After medical school at the University of Rochester and two years in the Navy, Dr. Kennell did his residency at Harvard Medical School. He was the chief resident at Boston Children’s Hospital before he moved to Cleveland in 1952 to teach at Case Western Reserve and serve as the attending pediatrician in the neonatal unit of the university hospital.        
Dr. Kennell, who died in Cleveland, is survived by his wife, Margaret Lloyd Kennell; a daughter, Susan; two sons, David and John, who confirmed his death; and five grandchildren.        
Dr. Kennell went on to study the bonding process from another perspective, looking at parents of infants who die in delivery or soon after being born. He was one of the first neonatal experts to recommend that the grieving parents hold their newborns, and his insights about the emotional benefits such physical contact can provide parents have been incorporated in the standard procedures of most neonatal intensive care units.        
Dr. Kennell also became an advocate of doulas, trained nonmedical professionals who help women during pregnancy, labor and postpartum. With Phyllis H. Klaus and Dr. Klaus, he wrote “The Doula Book: How a Trained Labor Companion Can Help You Have a Shorter, Easier and Healthier Birth,” published in 2003 and now in its third printing.        
The great question of his work, however, was the mystery of the chemistry between children and parents.        
“What is the process by which a father and mother become attached to an infant?” he asked in “Bonding,” a 1996 book he also wrote with the Klauses. “We have developed ever-greater respect for the complexities of the process. It is our continuing quest.”

Michael Cuddyer has never hit .300 in a major league season. A .271 career batter coming into 2013, Cuddyer, an outfielder for the Colorado Rockies, hit a career-high .284 in 2006 with Minnesota. The last time he hit higher than .300 in a full season on any level was 2001, when as a 22-year-old he hit .301 for Class AA New Britain. If you include his 4-for-18 performance in a brief call-up to the majors that season, his average drops to .298.        


All of that makes it curious that Cuddyer, at 34 and in his 13th season, led a tight race for the National League batting title, with a .331 average entering Saturday’s games.        
Cuddyer is not the most surprising player in recent baseball history to lead the N.L. in hitting. In 12 seasons, and nearly 5,000 plate appearances, he was well established as a power hitter with a modest average, but his ascension to the top of the batting leaders is no more shocking than that of Derrek Lee, a Chicago Cubs first baseman, who led the N.L. with a .335 average in 2005 after hitting .266 in his first eight seasons. What makes a potential batting title for Cuddyer interesting is that he is playing for the Rockies.        
Once known for home runs helped by Denver’s thin air — and known as the Blake Street Bombers — the Rockies have actually been far more dominant in terms of batting titles, and that is something that no humidor has been able to change.        
Andres Galarraga, the first player to sign with the Rockies, got things started right by posting an N.L.-leading .370 average in 1993, the franchise’s inaugural season. He hit .243 for St. Louis the season before. Including Galarraga, a Colorado batter has hit .330 or higher 16 times, leading to seven batting titles. The Rockies lead the majors in those categories since their inception. The Yankees come closest with a player batting .330 or better 11 times; no other team is in double digits.        
In terms of batters who could be accused of taking advantage of Coors Field, Cuddyer fits between Jeffrey Hammonds, who had a home/road split of .399/.275 in 2000, and Larry Walker, Todd Helton and Matt Holliday, all of whom were excellent hitters in any park. Helped along by a .378 batting average on balls in play, Cuddyer was hitting .347 at Coors Field entering the weekend and .318 on the road.        
The difference is not surprising because Coors Field has been the most conducive park in the majors for hits in 2013, according to ESPN’s park factor ratings, just as it was in each of the last five seasons. For all the talk of humidors and revamped pitching staffs making Colorado no longer a hitter’s haven, no major league park is better for raising batting averages.        
Cuddyer has also benefited from a relatively weak field. He has a small lead over Atlanta’s Chris Johnson — another surprising name among the leaders — but his .331 average would have led the league in only 15 of the previous 137 seasons. A stumble through July and August, when Cuddyer hit .287 in 167 at-bats, nearly sank his chances, but he recovered in September, hitting .404 in his first 15 games. If the race comes down to the wire, Cuddyer will have to take care of business on the road, as the Rockies finish the season with a three-game series in Los Angeles.        
A Cuddyer batting title would come with many caveats, but statistical outliers are part of what makes examining baseball’s record books fun. With a strong final week, Cuddyer could join Tony Gwynn, Rogers Hornsby and Honus Wagner on the list of N.L. batting champions, and that is worth paying attention to.

It was 2005, and Brandon Myers, then a little-used second-year tight end at Iowa, went home for a weekend in the off-season.        


Home was Prairie City, Iowa, population 1,680, a hamlet with a grocery, a convenience store, a hardware center and no traffic light. Myers drove five miles out of town, down a dirt road next to cornfields, and stopped at the house where he grew up with his parents, an older sister and an ever-changing assortment of hogs, horses and sheep.        
“I knew Brandon was coming to tell me that he wasn’t going back to college,” his father, Dan Myers, said Thursday. “He was having a hard time. He thought he was failing because he wasn’t playing and the coaches were on him. They wanted him to change a lot of things.”        
Father and son said little throughout the weekend, visiting Dan’s construction work sites and the 200-acre family farm where Brandon learned to drive a combine as a child. Then on Sunday afternoon, when Myers was about to announce that he was not going back to college, his father spoke first.        
“I told him that years from now, he didn’t want to be that guy standing in a bar in a small Iowa town telling everyone how he could have been a big-time football player,” Dan Myers said. “I said that his college coaches were testing him to see if he would quit or if he would fight back.        
“It was a pretty emotional deal, a turning-point moment.”        
Sitting alongside the Giants’ practice field, Myers, who is tied for the team lead in receptions this season, also recalled the 2005 conversation.        
“My dad told me not to give up on the chance to be something special,” he said Thursday. “He said I was too young for that. What he did was talk me out of a mistake.”        
Myers returned to campus and the football team’s intense off-season workouts.        
“There was a change in Brandon,” said Chris Doyle, Iowa’s strength and conditioning coach. “He had been a kid from a small town in Iowa trying to figure out things on a higher, more complicated level. But when he committed himself fully, we all saw the big-time player we always thought he could be.”        
By his senior year, Myers was a first-team all-Big Ten selection and then a sixth-round draft choice of the Oakland Raiders in 2009.        
“That’s what parents are for, right?” Myers said with a smile. “They help their kids when they need it most.”        
After a breakout season with the struggling Raiders in 2012, Myers signed a one-year free-agent contract hoping he could become the latest in a long succession of lesser-known Giants tight ends who had big roles in the offense (see Jake Ballard and Kevin Boss).        
With the Giants’ talented wide receivers Hakeem Nicks and Victor Cruz working the sideline routes, a tight end has plenty of room in the middle of the field to find open space.        
That is exactly where Myers was in the second quarter Sunday during the Giants’ game against the Denver Broncos. Eli Manning tossed a pass to Myers, who caught the ball near the Denver 30 with no defender between him and the end zone.        
Myers turned and began to sprint. About the 20, he tripped without being touched and toppled to the turf. It was a jarring gaffe. A 45-yard touchdown had become a 27-yard gain, a good outcome, but not the one the Giants, who trailed by 4 points, needed.        
If Giants fans had not yet learned the new tight end’s name, they knew by the end of that hard-to-watch play.        
“I’ve never ever done anything like that in a game,” Myers, 28, said. “Inexcusable.”        
To make matters worse, on the next play, as Myers was running another pattern across the middle with his head turned toward Manning, Denver safety Duke Ihenacho, who had been beaten on the previous play, slammed his shoulder pads into Myers’s rib cage. The violent hit drew a penalty. Myers got up slowly.        
Three plays later, as Myers stood at the 1, a high pass from Manning zipped through his raised hands. As the ball was eluding his grasp, he was drilled in the ribs again.        
Myers lay on the field for several seconds before he wobbled to his feet and all but staggered to the edge of the Giants’ field-goal formation. He was still wavering in his stance as Josh Brown kicked a field goal.        
Myers, who had six catches for 74 yards in the game, had his ribs wrapped the next day.        
Asked about the sequence of plays and his injury, Myers shrugged and said: “It’s a contact sport. It would have been a lot better if I hadn’t fallen down.”

JERUSALEM — Small groups of Jews are increasingly ascending the Temple Mount in Jerusalem’s Old City, a sacred site controlled for centuries by Muslims, who see the visits as a provocation that could undermine the fragile peace talks started this summer.        


For decades the Israelis drawn to the site were mainly a fringe of hard-core zealots, but now more mainstream Jews are lining up to enter, as a widening group of Israeli politicians and rabbis challenge the longstanding rules constraining Jewish access and conduct. Brides go on their wedding days, synagogue and religious-school groups make regular outings, and many surreptitiously skirt the ban on non-Muslim prayer, like a Russian immigrant who daily recites the morning liturgy in his mind, as he did decades ago in the Soviet Union.        
Palestinian leaders say the new activity has created the worst tension in memory around the landmark Al Aksa Mosque and Dome of the Rock, and have called on Muslims to defend the site from “incursions.” A spate of stone-throwing clashes erupted this month: on Wednesday, three Muslims were arrested and an Israeli police officer wounded in the face. And on Friday thousands of Arab citizens of Israel rallied in the north, warning that Al Aksa is in danger.        
“We reject these religious visits,” Sheik Ekrima Sa’eed Sabri, who oversees Muslim affairs in Jerusalem, said in an interview. “Our duty is to warn,” he added. “If they want to make peace in this region, they should stay away from Al Aksa.”        
The 37-acre site is perhaps the most religiously contested place on earth. Jews revere it as the home of the First and Second Temples 2,000 years ago. For Muslims, who call the site the Noble Sanctuary, it is the world’s third holiest spot, from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to heaven. More than 300,000 foreign tourists also flock there annually, many of them Christians drawn to the ruins of the temple Jesus attended.        
Politically, the competing claims to the area are the nut around which the Israeli-Palestinian conflict revolves, the symbolic heart of each side’s religious and historical attachment to Jerusalem that has made its governance one of the thorniest issues in peace negotiations.        
Israel captured the site along with the rest of East Jerusalem and the West Bank in 1967, with a general declaring dramatically, “The Temple Mount is in our hands!” But the government immediately returned control to the Muslim authorities, and ever since, a de facto accommodation has prevailed in which Muslims worship at Al Aksa above and Jews at the Western Wall below, a remnant of the retaining wall around the ancient Second Temple.        
There have been flare-ups before. In 2000, a visit by Ariel Sharon, then Israel’s opposition leader, accompanied by 1,000 police officers, prompted a violent outbreak and, many argue, set off the second intifada.        
Over the last few years, a cause long taken up by only a fringe group of far right-wingers has increasingly been embraced by the modern Orthodox — known here as religious Zionists — who have also gained political power. At three recent Parliament hearings, religious lawmakers and cabinet ministers questioned the status quo, in which non-Muslims can enter the site only for a few hours five days a week, and those identified by the police as Jews are separated, escorted by police officers and admonished not to dance, sing, bow down or even move their lips in prayer.        
“The Temple Mount is in our hands — but is it really?” asked Michael Freund, a Jerusalem Post columnist who visited the site as a child in 1977 and returned for the first time last year, with 50 members of his synagogue. “It particularly offends me that the Israeli government puts into place restrictions which prevent Jews from fulfilling their basic right to freedom of worship.”        
Jack Stroh, a cardiologist from East Brunswick, N.J., who visited on Wednesday, has been bringing friends for five years before the holidays of Sukkot and Passover — two of three pilgrimage festivals when ancient Jews were required to pray at the temples.

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Against the back wall of the Jets’ equipment room hangs a green No. 82 jersey. It rests on a green hanger and dangles from a silver hook, and it does not belong to Mickey Shuler or Rob Carpenter, who wore that number with pride, or, for that matter, to anyone on the current roster.        


This can be the source of much confusion.        
A year ago, when Konrad Reuland joined the Jets, he wondered why a No. 45 jersey was draped in the same spot. Three weeks passed before he asked.        
“I thought maybe something happened,” Reuland said. “Did someone pass away? Were they honoring somebody? Is it a memorial? Then I found out, and I said, Oh, that makes sense.”        
The answers to Reuland’s questions can be found on a small plaque affixed to the wall above the jersey. It celebrates the recipients of the Bill Hampton Award, presented to the rookie “who best exemplifies a ‘Pro’ in the locker room”— like Josh Baker (No. 45) and Hayden Smith (No. 82), who, to Reuland’s relief, remain very much alive.        
The winner’s jersey hangs for a year, and in plain view of players milling about their lockers. But the award, named after Hampton, a beloved former equipment director who retired after the 2000 season, has retained an air of mystery. The five members of the equipment staff, who determine the winner by secret ballot, do not mention it to rookies unless they are asked. So far, only one, defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson, has.        
“You get rewarded for acting like a professional?” said Richardson, recalling his reaction. “Shouldn’t you just do that?”        
In the eyes of the equipment director Gus Granneman and his staff, yes. Ideally, every rookie should comport himself like Brad Smith (No. 16, 2006), who after practice would pick up his teammates’ discarded sports drink bottles and deposit them in the trash. And ideally, every rookie would have the awareness to pack the shoes best suited to that week’s playing surface, instead of relying on Granneman or his assistants to do it for him. But that is not what happens.        
As soon as rookie minicamp begins in May, the staff starts observing the contenders. They notice if someone arrives in a suit or bookends his requests with please and thank you. They also notice if a player turns his helmet into a storage receptacle or treats his locker like a junkyard. It was not immediately known how they felt about those players shooting wadded-up balls of athletic tape into trash cans from across the room on Friday.        
Midway through the season, the staff decides on the finalists. Voting takes place in mid-December, which is also when the politicking tends to begin. With a laugh, Granneman said that Damon Harrison, last year’s runner-up, would call attention to his bag-packing prowess.        
For much of the year, though, the players are not even aware that they are competing against one another. Like many of his fellow rookies, Ryan Spadola, an undrafted receiver from Lehigh, had not even noticed Smith’s jersey hanging in the equipment room, let alone known the significance behind it. When told, Spadola said it helped him appreciate the high standards to which he said he held himself as an N.F.L. player.        
“Everything was our responsibility at Lehigh, so you really had to take it upon yourself to hold yourself accountable,” Spadola said. “That’s how we were taught. For myself, coming here, this is a great honor to have these guys helping us out, but I still need to take care of my area, like it’s my little home or bedroom.”        
Cleanliness is only one of the criteria that Granneman said he considered. Attention to detail is important. So is politeness. A few rookies, who were otherwise unaware of the Hampton award, offered their interpretation of what the equipment staff valued.        
“Being accountable to your teammates,” Richardson said.        
“Treating people and your equipment with dignity and respect,” offensive tackle Oday Aboushi said.        
“A high maturity level, because we all just came from college,” guard Will Campbell said.        
Other equipment staffs around the league no doubt expect their players to act professionally, but the Jets appear to be the only one that honors them for it. Of the 26 teams that responded to an inquiry, only one bestowed a similar award: the Philadelphia Eagles, under Andy Reid, honored the player — not the rookie — who exemplified professionalism. An Eagles spokesman said in an e-mail that he did not know whether the new coach, Chip Kelly, would continue the practice.        
When the Jets relocated here from Hempstead, N.Y., in 2008, Granneman said that one of his first thoughts was where to put the jersey. The tradition, informally, dates to 2002, when the equipment staff decided to reward a player who had shown marked improvement over the course of the season. As a joke, they gave him a sweatshirt.        
But it occurred to Granneman to introduce a more formal award, and he did so in 2004 (Erik Coleman, No. 26). The nine previous winners range from the sublime (Darrelle Revis, 2007) to the shifty (Danny Woodhead, 2008) to the sturdy (Matt Slauson, 2009), with the victory by Slauson, a guard, bucking precedent and conventional wisdom.        
“If a lineman wins it, you know he’s really going good,” Granneman said. “Those guys, by nature, aren’t the neatest.”        
Not many seem to have much staying power. It is the Jets’ micro version of the Madden video game curse or the Sports Illustrated cover jinx, because the last three recipients — John Conner, Baker and Smith — are all out of the N.F.L.        
“We haven’t had good luck predicting long-term success with the Jets,” Granneman said.        
Naturally, that will not stop him from granting the award for a 10th consecutive season. Granneman declined to handicap an early favorite but said there were plenty of appealing candidates.        
“We’ve been watching,” he said.

In the spring of the 1995 major league baseball season, a rookie named Andy Pettitte was pitching in relief for the Yankees. Another rookie, named Mariano Rivera, was starting and not doing well.        


Eighteen years, five World Series titles and one major role reversal later, they are moving in tandem toward retirement. Pettitte may start his last game ever at Yankee Stadium on Sunday, and Rivera, widely considered the best reliever ever, also begins the final week of his major league career, unless the Yankees somehow squeeze into the postseason.        
In 1995, the Yankees did not know what they had in Rivera. He was a skinny 25-year-old from Panama, and in his major league debut, on May 23, he lasted only three and a third innings in a game the Yankees lost to the California Angels by 10-0.        
In his next start, at Oakland, he did better, pitching into the sixth inning and giving up just one run as he notched his first major league victory in a 4-1 Yankees win. But nine days later, on June 6 in the Bronx, Rivera made his third start, again against the Athletics, and was pounded, giving up seven earned runs in four innings.        
“Another shabby outing by another young pitcher — both homers came off starter Mariano Rivera — produced another exasperating Yankee loss,” Jack Curry wrote for The New York Times. Rivera, he noted, was hit so hard by the A’s that “he resembled their favorite batting practice pitcher.”        
The day after Rivera was knocked out of that game, leaving the Yankees with a 14-21 record, it was the 22-year-old Pettitte’s turn. He had made his major league debut nearly a month before Rivera had — in a brief relief stint April 29 against Kansas City — and had made four more appearances out of the bullpen before Manager Buck Showalter put him in the starting rotation.        
He lasted five and a third innings against the A’s in Oakland in his first start on May 27, a 3-0 loss. He pitched a complete game against the Angels at Yankee Stadium on June 2, but lost again, this time by 3-2.        
And now start No. 3, against the same A’s team that had hammered Rivera the day before. Pettitte went seven innings, allowed just one run and four hits, and earned his first major league victory as the Yankees prevailed, 6-1.        
“For one night, Pettitte was a savior of sorts,” Curry wrote in The Times. “He saved the Yankees from disappearing even deeper in the American League East standings, saved them from possibly being swept by Oakland and saved them from another night of discontent by pitching wondrously.”        
The rest is — well, you know the rest. Pettitte, who went 12-9 that first season, now has 255 victories, the most of any active pitcher. Rivera, who ended up making 10 starts in 1995 and none after that, has more saves than any other pitcher (652). And, over the last two decades, he has closed out 72 of Pettitte’s victories.        
But for two days in June 1995, it was the other way around, with Pettitte picking up for Rivera. Call it a footnote to two amazingly formidable careers.

Liverpool’s unbeaten start to the season came to an end on Saturday against visiting Southampton, but Everton won at West Ham to remain the only unbeaten team in England’s Premier League.        


Dejan Lovren’s header gave Southampton a 1-0 victory at Anfield.        
Everton staged a second-half comeback to beat West Ham, 3-2, with two goals by Leighton Baines before Romelu Lukaku headed in the winner.        
The meeting of the league’s two winless teams ended with West Bromwich Albion beating Sunderland, 3-0; Hull came from behind to win, 3-2, at Newcastle; and Aston Villa ended a three-game losing streak by defeating Norwich, 1-0. In the day’s late game, Chelsea rebounded from its home loss to Basel in the Champions League and ended a four-game winless run in its defeat of Fulham, 2-0.        
Liverpool has been the surprise team so far this season as it tries to win its first English title since 1990. But against Southampton, Liverpool could not beat goalkeeper Artur Boruc, who made a key save on Steven Gerrard’s free kick in the first half and also denied Victor Moses.        
The winner came in the 54th minute, with Lovren scoring from Adam Lallana’s corner.        
In London, West Ham led at halftime on a goal by Ravel Morrison, and although Baines tied the score in the 62nd minute, the hosts’ lead was restored from the penalty spot by Mark Noble.        
At Carrow Road, Villa’s American international goalkeeper Brad Guzan saved a penalty by Robert Snodgrass in the sixth minute.        
It proved costly as Libor Kozak scored for Villa on the half-hour.        
The Czech striker, who entered the game for the injured Christian Benteke, scored with a close-range shot set up by Gabriel Agbonlahor.        
MUNICH BLANKS SCHALKE Defending champion Bayern Munich routed Schalke, 4-0, to join Borussia Dortmund in first place in Germany’s Bundesliga.        
Two goals in two minutes set Munich on its way.        
Bastian Schweinsteiger scored with a header from Arjen Robben’s corner in the 21st minute before Mario Mandzukic made it 2-0.        
David Alaba set up Franck Ribery to score from close range in the 75th. Then Claudio Pizarro scored his first goal of the season in the 84th minute, three minutes after entering the game as a substitute.        
Dortmund earlier drew, 1-1, at Nuremberg to drop its first points of the season.        
Dortmund defender Marcel Schmelzer opened the scoring with a curling free kick over the wall and inside the right post in the 37th.        
But Per Nilsson equalized after a Nuremberg free kick in the 51st minute.        
Werder Bremen won, 2-0, over Hamburg, which fired Thorsten Fink as coach last Monday. Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen won, 4-1, at Mainz; Wolfsburg came from behind to defeat Hoffenheim, 2-1; and Szabolcs Huszti’s late penalty gave Hannover a 2-1 win over Augsburg.        
BASTIA HOLDS MARSEILLE Marseille’s poor run continued when it was held to a 0-0 draw at Bastia in the French league.        
Marseille, which is without a win in four matches, was looking to bounce back from Wednesday’s 2-1 defeat against visiting Arsenal in the Champions League.        
Midfielder Lucas Mendes tested Bastia goalkeeper Mickael Landreau with a header from a corner midway through the second half, and the visitors were unlucky not to be awarded a late penalty when the substitute Saber Khalifa was tripped by defender Francois-Joseph Modesto.        
FOUR GOALS FOR LINGARD Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard made a stunning start to his one-month loan at Birmingham City by scoring all four goals in a 4-1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in the League Championship on Saturday.        
Lingard, 20, scored three times in a blistering 13-minute spell midway through the first half and after adding his fourth in the 51st minute before being lifted for a substitute with 20 minutes to play.        
The signing of Lingard provided a welcome boost for Birmingham, which had started the day with only four points and four goals in its first seven league games of the season.        
Lingard, an England under-21 international, has yet to make his first-team debut for the Premier League champions but impressed during preseason for Manchester United.        
The Italian striker Federico Macheda, another Manchester United player on loan, scored both goals for Doncaster Rovers as they held Nottingham Forest to a 2-2 draw in their second-division game.        
BUFFON SITS OUT The Juventus captain Gianluigi Buffon, 35, has been dropped for the Serie A match against Hellas Verona on Sunday, Manager Antonio Conte said.        
“I can confirm that Marco Storari will start,” Conte said. “It’s a normal rotation that we also did last year. Buffon is coming from international duty, and we have another four games in quick succession ahead of us, so together with him and the fitness coaches we decided to rest him.”        
Conte also reacted to criticism of his handling of striker Fernando Llorente, whom Juventus signed from Athletic Bilbao.        
Llorente was sidelined by Bilbao Manager Marcelo Bielsa after refusing to sign a deal with the club.        
He agreed to join Juventus last January but has hardly played this season, leading to speculation that he will soon depart.        
“He’s not played for a year and he’s needed more time to rediscover his best form, the necessary intensity and on field aggression, both his and that of the opposition,” Conte said. “When you don’t play for a year, you lose these things.        
“It could be that he plays tomorrow, or that he plays Wednesday, or next Sunday.” (REUTERS) 
TORONTO HIRES G.M. Tim Bezbatchenko, 31, will leave his job as senior director of player relations and competition for M.L.S. to take over Toronto’s front office. Toronto, which is 4-14-11 this season, fired its president and general manager, Kevin Payne, on Sept. 5. (AP)

BOSTON — The Boston Red Sox were on the verge of clinching a playoff berth, and Fenway Park was packed with its biggest crowd of the season on Wednesday.        


The fans did not attend this midweek game against Baltimore simply because they were hoping to celebrate their team’s return to the postseason. It was also Dollar Beard Night, which drew more than 4,000 — with many turned away — sporting real or fake facial hair to honor the hirsute heroes who helped to turn a last-place and unlovable team into the best in baseball in just one season. The offer was simple: $1 tickets to patrons who showed up wearing beards.        
“Werewolves of London” played over the ballpark speakers while the scoreboard video cut from men with long-curated shrubs on their chins to women and children with fake facial hair glued or painted on. Even the team’s mascot, Wally the Green Monster, slapped on some felt.        
“The beards are part of the camaraderie; it’s almost intense,” John Henry, the team’s principal owner, said. “I, for one, underestimated — potentially have always underestimated — the effect of camaraderie.”        
A throwback to the times when the Red Sox had to hustle to sell tickets, Dollar Beard Night also brought back memories of the beloved Boston teams of the not-so-distant past — the Dirt Dogs of the 1990s, the Cowboy Up team of 2003 and the Idiots, who in 2004 ended the franchise’s 86-year championship drought.        
Since then, the team had fallen back into some of its less-celebrated traditions. The checkbooks were opened for big-name free agents, without regard for how they would respond in the lineup or the clubhouse.        
That strategy collapsed along with the ball club in September 2011, when the team went 7-20 and squandered a nine-game lead in the American League wild-card race. The next season, there was no sudden breakdown: The Red Sox stumbled to a 69-93, last-place finish, the team’s worst in almost a half-century.        
“It was a 13-month reboot,” Larry Lucchino, the Red Sox president and chief executive, said last week. “Thirteen months ago, we were down and out. And maybe something like that can be, in this perverse way, can be a positive thing for an organization that had a lot of early and sustained success. An opportunity to reassess what we were doing and how we were doing it.”        
The opportunity presented itself in August 2012 in the form of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were willing to take Josh Beckett, Carl Crawford and Adrian Gonzalez and more than $250 million in future salaries off Boston’s hands — in one transaction cleansing many of the bad feelings, the bad contracts and the bad karma. Manager Bobby Valentine, who had been brought in to bolster clubhouse discipline after Terry Francona’s reign ended in the stunning collapse, was replaced by the former Boston pitching coach John Farrell.        
And when the team arrived for spring training this year, it could do more than talk about a fresh start. Third baseman Will Middlebrooks said players did more together off the field.        
“In no way am I saying there were a lot of bad guys in here,” Middlebrooks said. “It’s just, camaraderie and the way these guys have meshed together is a lot different.”        
Mike Napoli was signed as a free agent, as was Shane Victorino, a happy-go-lucky sort. The newcomers Mike Carp, Jonny Gomes and David Ross, along with Dustin Pedroia and Jarrod Saltalamacchia, form the nucleus of the beard brigade.        
“The guys they got cared about winning,” outfielder Daniel Nava said, “and they cared about the guy that’s to their left and to their right.”        
Did the Red Sox expect things to turn around so quickly?        
Lucchino said he thought the Red Sox should have been better last year, if not for bad luck and bad health that cost a record number of games to injury. Henry noted that the team had one of the highest payrolls in baseball in 2012 and was in the top five again this season.        
“To me, last year was an anomalous year,” Henry said.        
Henry credited Farrell and General Manager Ben Cherington with bringing a “presence and stability.” Lucchino said that the relationship among the team’s brain trust was also more stable now than it was even during much of the mostly successful run shared by Francona and the former general manager Theo Epstein.        
“The goal here was to change the performance, the personality and the perception of the team,” Lucchino said Wednesday as he looked out over the crowd, announced at 38,540.        
“I think we’ve succeeded in doing that.”

KABUL, Afghanistan — A man in an Afghan National Army uniform killed three coalition soldiers on or near an American base on Saturday, according to Afghan officials.        


It was the first suspected insider attack since July. If confirmed, it would be the seventh this year, compared with about three times as many last year.        
Since this spring, Afghan forces have taken over at least nominal responsibility for combat operations throughout the country, meaning a greatly reduced number of joint operations. In addition, American and NATO forces have stepped up measures intended to stop insider attacks, including rules about not being alone with Afghan soldiers.        
Gen. Dawlat Waziri, the deputy spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, said the shooting took place around 10:30 a.m. in the city of Gardez in the eastern Afghan province of Paktia, when a man dressed in an Afghan soldier’s uniform opened fire on foreign troops, killing three. Afghan National Army soldiers then shot the attacker to death, he said.        
The NATO-led coalition, the International Security Assistance Force, confirmed the shooting, but declined to characterize it as an insider attack pending further investigation.        
“I.S.A.F. and Afghan officials are assessing the incident to determine the facts,” the coalition said in a news release.        
Neither Afghan nor American officials would identify the nationality of the victims, but most international troops in the area are American. One Afghan government official in Paktia Province, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to release details, confirmed that the attack took place inside the American base near Gardez, Forward Operation Base Lightning. Other officials did not confirm where in Gardez the shooting had taken place.        
He said that the victims were American Special Operations troops who had been training Afghan soldiers and that the attacker was an Afghan National Army soldier.

JERUSALEM — A Palestinian man lured an Israeli soldier he worked with at a sandwich shop outside Tel Aviv to the West Bank on Friday, and killed him in hopes of using the body as leverage to lobby for the release of his brother from an Israeli prison, military officials said Saturday.        


Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said the Palestinian, Nidal Omar, had confessed to the crime after being arrested with seven others early Saturday.        
The closeness of the relationship between Mr. Omar, 42, and the soldier, Sgt. Tomer Hazan, 20, remained unclear late Saturday, but the owner of the shop in Bat Yam where they worked said in a television interview that both men were well liked. Colonel Lerner said Mr. Omar had persuaded Sergeant Hazan to go with him in a taxi Friday from Israel to a Jewish settlement in the West Bank and then to Beit Amin, a nearby Palestinian village of 1,100, where his family is from.        
Mr. Omar then took Sergeant Hazan to an open area, killed him and hid his body in a water cistern, according to Colonel Lerner, who said Mr. Omar “wanted to barter with the dead body.” Colonel Lerner did not say how the soldier had died.        
The news heightened tensions amid the fragile peace talks that Israel and the Palestinians started this summer.        
Mr. Omar’s relatives said he is married to an Israeli citizen, lives in the Arab-Israeli town of Jaljulia with her and their eight children, and had earned about $2,500 a month serving shawarma in the Bat Yam shop for the past four years. But Colonel Lerner said Mr. Omar did not have the permit required to work or stay in Israel.        
On Saturday night, several hundred people protested outside the sandwich shop against Palestinians working illegally in Israel, some shouting, “Death to Arabs.”        
Since the second intifada a decade ago and Israel’s subsequent building of a barrier separating it from most of the West Bank, Israeli travel to West Bank villages like Beit Amin is relatively uncommon. How Mr. Omar had persuaded Sergeant Hazan to go with him was under investigation.        
The kidnapping of soldiers in Israel, where military service is mandatory for most Jews, is among the most profound fears for Israelis. In late 2011, Israel agreed to release more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Gilad Shalit, a soldier who had been abducted five years before by Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip.        
The Israeli military recently reported a sharp rise in Palestinian plots to kidnap soldiers in hopes of trading them for some of the 4,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. A total of 37 such plans have been thwarted so far this year, more than in all of 2012, Colonel Lerner said.        
Israel released 26 long-serving Palestinian prisoners last month, and is expected to release about 75 more in three phases, as part of the Washington-brokered peace talks.        
Right-wing politicians who oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state seized on the killing to bolster their argument.        
“One does not make peace with terrorists who throw soldiers’ bodies into a hole in the ground,” Naftali Bennett, an Israeli minister, said Saturday. “One fights them without mercy.”        
Colonel Lerner said Mr. Omar’s imprisoned brother, Nur ad-Din Omar, had been incarcerated since 2003 and was a member of the Tanzim militia, an offshoot of the Fatah faction.        
Another brother, Mahmoud Abdullah Omar, said Nur was serving a 30-year sentence for a shooting that had injured some Israel soldiers.        
Sergeant Hazan was in a noncombat job in the air force and worked part time at the sandwich shop. His Facebook page, filled Saturday with condolences, showed photos of him at parties and pools.        
“He was like my son — there’s no other boy like him,” the restaurant owner, who was not identified, said on Israel’s Channel 2 news. Of Mr. Omar, the owner said: “He was on good terms with everyone. Nice as can be.”        
Sergeant Hazan’s family reported him missing at 10 p.m. Friday, prompting an investigation, the military said. Mr. Omar’s mother said many Israeli soldiers with three dogs arrived at 3 a.m. Saturday, and stayed until 4 p.m. Six Omar brothers were arrested, she said.        
“I condemn what he did a million times,” said Mahmoud Omar, who was not arrested. “He ruined our lives.”

Teams hoping to bolster their pitching rotation this winter will have a final look at most of their free-agent options this week, and all are hoping for the kind of success the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Pittsburgh Pirates had last off-season.        


Ervin Santana, Matt Garza, Tim Lincecum and Ricky Nolasco are among the players available, but based on last winter’s signings, there are really only two choices for luring a productive free-agent starter from another team: pay exorbitant prices for a premium talent or pay almost nothing and hope for a turnaround. Most other deals, at least last off-season, disappointed: Edwin Jackson and Joe Blanton, Dan Haren and Brandon McCarthy, Joe Saunders and Shaun Marcum, to name a few.        
At the top of the salary scale, the Dodgers lavished six years and $147 million on Zack Greinke, who is 15-3 with a 2.75 earned run average for the National League West champions. At the bottom, the Pirates pulled off the steal of the off-season, snagging Francisco Liriano for a guarantee of just $1 million.        
Liriano leads the Pirates in wins, going 16-7 with an E.R.A. of 2.88, and the team is poised for its first winning season since 1992 and, almost certainly, a berth in the playoffs. Even after being named to the All-Star team in July, Jeff Locke, a fellow Pirates left-hander, called Liriano the most important part of the team’s renaissance.        
“Liriano was that missing piece that kind of put everything together,” Locke said. “Frankie’s fun to watch.”        
Liriano, 29, has been fun to watch before. He won 12 of 15 decisions as a rookie for Minnesota in 2006, and threw a no-hitter for the Twins in 2011. But he slipped badly in 2012, going 6-12 with a 5.34 E.R.A. for the Twins and the Chicago White Sox. The Pirates, who raised their payroll this season but still hunt for bargains, took an interest.        
“I don’t know that we saw something that everybody else missed,” General Manager Neal Huntington said. “We were willing to take a chance. We saw a guy that, if everything clicked, had three above-average major league pitches: the slider and the changeup for sure, and the fastball if we could get him to command it a little bit better. With the change in leagues, with the change in ballparks, with the change in team, we thought he could come over here and do a very nice job for us.”        
The previous off-season, the Pirates had taken a similar chance on A. J. Burnett, acquiring him in a trade with the Yankees. Like Liriano, Burnett had exceptional stuff but often struggled to harness it. In a new environment, Burnett flourished, going 16-10 in 2012. He has tailed off to 8-11 in 2013.        
The Pirates and Liriano originally agreed to a two-year, $12.75 million contract last off-season. But before he signed the deal, Liriano broke his right (nonthrowing) arm in an accident at home. That slashed the guarantee to just $1 million.        
“It essentially made it a make-good deal,” Huntington said, “that if he got healthy and stayed healthy, he had a chance to earn the money that he would have made. And he’s gone out and he’s earned it. I can’t say enough good things about the man.”        
Despite missing the first month of the season, Liriano reached a career high in victories, with 15, on Aug. 30. After that game, he said he had changed his approach since his younger days.        
“I’m not trying to be a strikeout guy,” said Liriano, who still averages roughly a strikeout an inning. “Early in my career, I was going to try harder and blow people out. Now I just try to go deep in games.”        
Reducing his walks has probably helped the most. In each of the last two seasons, Liriano averaged at least five walks per nine innings. This season, helped by a delivery in which he gets his hands higher over his head, Liriano has averaged about three and a half walks per nine.        
“He’s become fearless with pounding the strike zone,” Huntington said. “He still gets a lot of chases, but he’s throwing better quality strikes than he has in the past.        
“It was a choice of risk-reward for us, and we decided to go with the higher risk/higher reward guy, because we felt like if we hit, we had a chance to really grab a very good major league pitcher, and he deserves the credit.”

LONDON — Acquiescing to years of Afghan government demands, Pakistan released a senior Taliban commander on Saturday in a bid to help kick-start peace talks in Afghanistan.        


But news of the release met with a mixed reception in Afghanistan, amid questions about the extent of the freed commander’s influence over the Taliban — or his personal intent toward peace talks.        
The Pakistani Foreign Ministry said it had released the commander, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a founding member of the Afghan Taliban and a former deputy to the movement’s leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, in an effort to “further facilitate the Afghan reconciliation process.”        
Mr. Baradar was captured in a joint operation by the C.I.A. and Pakistani intelligence in the port city of Karachi in 2010, and his detention has been a point of contention among Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United States ever since.        
Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil, a former Taliban foreign minister, welcomed Mr. Baradar’s release as a step toward peace talks between the Afghan government and insurgents.        
But a Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, declined to comment, saying he was waiting for direction from his superiors. “I cannot say anything until I receive something from our superiors,” he said. “I have been trying to get reaction all day.”        
The release had been expected for several weeks.        
Critics of such releases, who are most vocal in Afghanistan, point out that Mr. Baradar has not publicly stated whether he supports peace negotiations, or whether is willing to play a role in talks.        
“We have to be cautious and we shouldn’t be overly optimistic about what is going to happen next,” said Sayed Mohammad Amin Tariq, a member of Afghanistan’s High Peace Council from Badakhshan. “We should now see if Mr. Baradar can really help the peace process or whether he will rejoin the Taliban and fight.”        
A spokesman for the High Peace Council, Maulavi Shahzada Shahid, was more upbeat, however, calling the release “a good sign for the strengthening of the peace process between the Taliban and the Afghan government.”        
“Now it is Mullah Baradar’s moral obligation, for the sake of peace and stability, he should assist the peace process between the Taliban and the Afghan government,” Mr. Shahid added.        
The circumstances of Mr. Baradar’s release were unclear, although American officials had privately lobbied for Pakistan to keep Mr. Baradar under house arrest. On Friday, a State Department spokeswoman told reporters it was important that such releases were conducted in a “responsible manner.”        
The spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said that Mr. Baradar’s release was “a matter of ongoing discussion between Pakistan and Afghanistan in order to promote peace as part of this reconciliation process.”        
Asked if the United States had asked that Pakistan keep an eye on Mr. Baradar, she said, “This is a decision for the government of Pakistan.”        
Pakistani officials argued that Mr. Baradar’s continued detention would anger the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, who had personally called for his release.        
Mr. Baradar will remain in Pakistan and will be protected by a security detail, intelligence officials in Islamabad told The Associated Press, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

BERLIN — It would be easy to mock the political campaign that ends with Sunday’s national elections in Germany as a version of fiddling while Rome burns. It has lacked any heated debate over the nation’s role in maintaining the common European currency or addressing the crippling levels of unemployment among its southern neighbors.        


The clashes over intervention in Syria that consumed the Britain, France, Russia and the United States for weeks barely made a political ripple here, underscoring how deeply Germans shun the use of force. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right government and the left-leaning opposition remained largely united in supporting an ambitious and costly plan to wean the economy off nuclear power and carbon fuels. There was little talk of the demographic challenges of an aging population.        
It was a showcase for the postwar German tendency toward consensus, and was all the more remarkable for the contrast it provided to the bitter ideological clashes playing out in the United States and many other big democracies. It could well yield an outcome almost unfathomable in peacetime Washington, Paris or London: a power-sharing agreement between the main parties of the left and right.        
The relative comity between the major parties on the campaign trail does not mean that Ms. Merkel, assuming she emerges to lead the next government, can escape tough choices or that Germany can insulate itself from forces beyond its control: from the financial markets and the global economy to tumult in the Middle East and a Russia that is trying to reassert itself.        
Welcomed by many Germans as stability at a time of prosperity, the mood may nonetheless disappoint Germany’s allies in the United States, who would love to see the country assert itself more in Europe, as well as its partners in the European Union who just want to end the bloc’s doldrums and look to Germany for bolder action.        
Frustrating as it may be, this Germany of slow steps and consensus politics is precisely the one that the United States and its victorious European allies sought to forge in the smoldering ruins of World War II. It is a structure that was reinforced as late as the country’s reunification after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when the old German question of how to tame the country’s undoubted power was solved by wrapping it still tighter in the bonds of a unified Europe, the very ones being tested today by a slow-grinding economic crisis.        
It is also a system that has promoted steady and farsighted vision on big issues. More than in most Western democracies, German leaders, including Ms. Merkel, who is seeking a third term, have persuaded their people to endure short-term pains for longer-term gains — whether reunification, energy transformation or, a decade ago, the kinds of labor and economic overhauls that other European nations are still blinking at.        
“We are the students very eager to learn the American re-education program,” said Jürgen Falter, 69, a professor at the University of Mainz and an expert both on the Nazi past and Germany’s complex electoral system. “And we have really fully internalized it — we go for pacifism, not belligerence, consensus rather than conflict.”        
After 1945, the Allies deliberately built a federal structure that dispersed power from Berlin and scattered national institutions throughout what was then West Germany. In addition, they devised an electoral law virtually guaranteed to produce a coalition government; no chancellor since Konrad Adenauer in the late 1950s has been able to govern alone.        
For proof, take Ms. Merkel of the Christian Democrats and her main rival, Peer Steinbrück of the Social Democrats. Numerous domestic and international observers have struggled to detect vibrancy in the back-and-forth between Ms. Merkel’s camp and Mr. Steinbrück’s over any range of issues — child allowance for nonworking mothers, how best to preserve generally good and cheap health care, and even what Berlin really intends for the 17-nation euro zone or the 28-member European Union.        
The distinctions in their positions fall squarely into the two social groupings from which they spring: the Christian middle class in the case of the Christian Democrats, and the working class and trade unions for the Social Democrats.        
The center-left is more open about the possible need to raise taxes, given the impoverished state of Germany’s municipal and state coffers. By common agreement, the national infrastructure — road, rail, bridges and the broadband Internet — sorely needs attention and investment.

This interview with Rakesh Kapoor, chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant. 


Q. What were some important early lessons for you? 
A. I was born in a very small town in India, and the literacy rate at the time was just one in six. Thankfully, one of the biggest things my parents could do for me is to recognize that if I stayed in that town it would be very difficult to get out. And I remember learning how my parents decided that I had to leave. I was playing marbles, and I had an exam the next day. My mother said, “Why aren’t you studying for your exam?” And I said: “What’s the point? I’ll be first anyway.”        
I wasn’t that bright, but in that small town, I would have been first. So my parents sent me to the No. 1 school in India, which happened to be a boarding school in New Delhi. It immediately changed the game for me. I went from somebody who had never been second in class to the middle of the class. The bar was immediately raised, and I had to work really hard.        
The lesson for me is that a very important part of leadership is to set a bar for people and to constantly keep them out of their comfort zone. I think status quo is a real enemy for progress. And getting out of my own comfort zone is just as important.        
Q. Any other influences from your parents?  
A. I asked my mom recently if she saw anything in my early childhood years that would tell her that there was something greater in store for me. She told a story of when I was pretty young, and I had some medical problem. She took me to an ayurvedic doctor, and he gave me a concoction that I had to put on my tongue, rather than swallowing, every day. I would do it every day and not complain.        
One day, my mom tried the medicine to see what it tasted like. And she said it was the most bitter, awful medicine. When she was telling me about this recently, she said, “I think one of the things about you is that you don’t complain about something you have to do.” And I think this is a leadership lesson, too. You have to swallow many bitter pills in your life. You just can’t keep complaining about how life should be. You’ve got to accept the way you have to run your life and then do the very best you can.        
Q. Tell me about your first career job. 
A. I come from a background of entrepreneurs, and after I got my M.B.A., I joined a start-up rather than a big company. I found that to be a much more exciting way of learning.        
I became an area sales manager for an electric typewriter company, and I was sent to a state called Gujarat. We went there and there was nothing. I said to my boss: “Can you even tell me where’s the office? Which way do you want me to go?” He said: “There’s no office address. That’s why we hired you, to build our business.” And for the next couple of years I recruited a huge number of people and we created the second-largest business of that company. So I tell people that when you choose your first job, choose one where you can really make a difference from Day 1, rather than getting submerged in a big-company mind-set.        
It also taught me that if you are going to be successful, you’ve got to treat your company like your very own. Because, as an entrepreneur, you are depending on yourself to create the value, not anyone else. You cannot rely on other people to tell you what to do. You’ve got to take the initiative yourself. And if you do that, you know, you are going to have a great chance of success.        
Q. Important lessons you’ve learned from mentors over the years? 
A. My previous boss was a very successful C.E.O. He ran the company for over a decade and we achieved fantastic results. He taught me many things, but he was immensely focused. Time is the only one clear constraint in life, and if you focus on a few things, you have a great chance of achieving something interesting. He taught people — like me and others who have this burning desire to achieve more and more — to prioritize and to be very consistent with the priorities. He never changed the strategy in 12 years. He focused on a few big things and went after them.        
Q. You said you came from a family of entrepreneurs, but now you’re running a big company. How do you try to foster an entrepreneurial culture? 
A. You have to take risks. Entrepreneurship also means that we need more ideas than we have money for. I keep telling people, you think we are working for a big company, but I’m going to starve you of resources. Only then will I have the best ideas. Scarcity gives rise to more ideas than abundance does. Scarcity is the mother of invention. I’ve grown up like that.        
Scale is also the enemy of speed. As you become bigger, you’re going to get slower and slower. So you have to create small teams, because they are more effective and more efficient than big teams. You also have to be careful about how many layers you’re creating.        
Q. How do you hire? What qualities are you looking for? 
A. One is how bright they are. You’ve got to have a level of intellectual agility. The second thing I look for is hunger for success. Is the person hungry or have they had enough? If there’s hunger for success, the person will, by and large, outperform those who don’t.        
Q. And your career advice? 
A. In my whole life, I’ve never worried about my next job. I never did. I never thought, “Since I’m doing so well, what will come next?” I always thought the job I was doing was the very best job of my life. So I tell people, don’t worry about what somebody else is doing and when they are getting promoted and how much money they’re making. We look around a bit too much. None of that is going to help you do a better job. So do the very best you can of the job that is given to you. It’s like swallowing the bitter pill. Stop complaining. I hate complaining. Put heart and emotion into it. That’s it.

Foreign,"










ADONIS, Lebanon — When Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, wanted to bolster his argument that rebels had carried out the poison gas attacks near Damascus on Aug. 21, he pointed to the work of a 61-year-old Lebanese-born nun who had concluded that the horrifying videos showing hundreds of dead and choking victims, including many children, had been fabricated ahead of time to provide a pretext for foreign intervention.        


“Mr. Lavrov is an intelligent person,” said the nun, Mother Agnes Mariam of the Cross, with a wide smile in a recent interview in this Lebanese mountain town. “He will never stick his name to someone who is saying stupidities.”        
Mother Agnes, who had lived in Syria for years, has no expertise or training in chemical weapons forensics or filmmaking, and although she was in Damascus at the time of the attacks, she did not visit the sites or interview victims. Still, her assertions — she does not say which side made the videos — have significantly raised her once modest profile as the longtime superior of the Monastery of St. James the Mutilated, a Melkite Greek Catholic monastery in central Syria.        
Now, she is lauded by supporters of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, for championing narratives that resemble his own, and vilified by opposition activists who suspect the government supports her work as an unofficial ambassador.        
International rights groups see Mr. Lavrov’s reference to the work of an untrained nun as a sign of desperation.        
“The fact that the Russian government is relying on this woman’s assessment of what happened just shows the lack of evidence for their case,” said Lama Fakih, a Syria researcher for Human Rights Watch. “She is not a military expert.”        
There are other shadows around Mother Agnes. She has helped foreign journalists obtain visas, suggesting trust by the government. The widow and two colleagues of Gilles Jacquier, a French journalist killed in Homs last year, published a book in which they suggest that she conspired in a lethal trap set by the government.        
She has sued them for libel, denied any link to the government and has not spoken out in support of Mr. Assad himself. She criticized Syria for its occupation of Lebanon that ended in 2005 and said that government helicopters had struck near the St. James monastery three times, causing damage. Her only interest, she said, is what is best for Syrians — she said that would be for outside powers not to interfere so that Syrians could solve their problems.        
“It is not politics,” she said. “This is humanitarian.”        
She refused to say who she thought had made the videos she called fakes, or who she thought had carried out the attacks. “I cannot incriminate, and I won’t incriminate,” she said. But she suspects that some of the children in the videos had been abducted by fighters from Al Qaeda in Alawite villages more than 150 miles away — a view also voiced by Syrian officials.        
In a baggy brown habit, a white wimple, a black veil and rubber sandals, with a large cross around her neck, Mother Agnes described a devout life that until recently had stayed away from Middle East politics.        
Born Marie Fadia Laham in Beirut, she was educated by French nuns. The death of her father when she was 15 left her asking “existential questions.”        
“This led me to become a hippie,” she said with a grin.        
She fell in with foreigners who came to Lebanon for the drugs — “Lebanese marijuana is the best in the world,” she said — and traveled to India and Tibet before returning to religion. At 19, she said, she became a nun in the Carmelite order, where she spent the next 22 years. Much of that was consumed by Lebanon’s 15-year civil war, during which she aided displaced families, she said.        
She eventually moved to Syria, becoming the superior at the St. James monastery and overseeing a community of 3 monks and 12 nuns in the town of Qara in the Homs diocese.        
The uprising that began in Syria in 2011 trickled into the monastery at first through stories told by Muslim laborers, Mother Agnes said. But she became more immersed later that year when she began her own research.        
Through conversations with Syrians and clergy throughout the country, she said, she uncovered “the false flag of the Arab Spring.” Instead of a popular uprising by citizens enraged by economic stagnation and political oppression, she said, she found a conspiracy cooked up by international powers to destroy Syria.        
She said the government’s brutal crackdowns on peaceful protesters had been concocted by the news media, and she dismissed the slow transformation of the opposition movement into an armed uprising, saying the rebels had rushed to violence. While allowing that some protesters had good intentions, she said the conflict was driven by foreign powers, including Israel, Saudi Arabia, the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda. She pointed to Syria’s current situation, with more than 100,000 dead, bitter sectarian tensions and jihadists taking over swaths of territory, as proof that she was right all along.        
“What happened is the interference of half the globe in Syrian affairs, infiltrating Syria with foreign fighters, recycling Al Qaeda and putting under threat the civilian population,” she said, adding that the world had failed Syria. “We are here, and we didn’t achieve anything. We destroyed Syria.”        
She has paid a price for speaking out. This year, rebels near the monastery warned her that extremist fighters wanted to abduct her, and helped her flee, she said. She had not returned.        
After the chemical attacks last month, she said, she locked herself in a hotel room in Geneva and pored over videos of the dead on her computer, sleeping only in short spurts and subsisting on water. “It was like a descent into hell,” she recalled. She said she had submitted her findings to foreign diplomats and officials with the United Nations Human Rights Council in a 50-page report that pointed out what she considered inconsistencies in the videos, and asked why there were few images of women and burials. Mr. Lavrov cited her a few days later.        
Her work has also won her acclaim with Mr. Assad’s supporters. Many of them are in Syria’s Christian minority, which makes up 10 percent of the population and has mostly stayed out of the war. Many fear that a victory by the predominately Sunni opposition would leave them with no place in the country, and have cast their lot with Mr. Assad.        
“She is a patriot, she loves Syria and Christianity, she stands tall and is never afraid to tell the truth,” said a 30-year-old Christian woman reached by phone in Damascus who gave only her first name, Alissar, for security reasons.        
But Sid Ahmed Hammouche, a Swiss reporter who helped write the book accusing Mother Agnes of complicity in his colleague’s death, sees her differently. “She defends the regime and plays the Christian card,” he said. “We know very well that Bashar wanted to play the Christian card, and he still does.”
