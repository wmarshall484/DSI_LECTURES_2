## Graph Theory Lecture

These are my very rough lecture notes for the Graph Theory day.

#### Whiteboard portion

Continuing with my [hand-written notes](graphs_notes_color.pdf)...

Let us ask an ambiguous question: "Which nodes in our graph are the most central?"

How would you answer this question? Make students say their ideas.

Now talk about degree centrality and betweenness centrality. See notes. Notice how degree and betweenness can disagree!

If you are Facebook, degree centrality might make sense. (?)

If you are dealing with airports... betweenness central might make sense. (?)

So it depends on your domain which centrality measure is good for you. Maybe invent your own!
